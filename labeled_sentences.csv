this is a podcast from techandainews.com .,technology
for more information visit our website .,technology
you want to know what all the fuss is about with this stable diffusion three.five update ?,technology
yeah everyones saying it is changing ai image generation but is it all hype ?,technology
or is there something there ?,technology
let me tell you there definitely substance behind the excitement .,technology
this is not a minor tweak .,technology
we are talking about a major overhaul .,technology
yeah you could say that .,technology
whats interesting is that stability ai did not release one new model .,technology
they gave u a couple of different version stable diffusion three.five and large turtle .,technology
it is not a one size fit all situation anymore .,technology
it is more theyve given u a specialized set of tool .,technology
we can choose which one is best depending on what we are working on .,technology
it is a toolbox then .,technology
yeah i picked the tool for the job .,technology
let talk about those two version then .,technology
large and large turbo .,technology
whats the difference ?,technology
think of it this way .,technology
if speed is everything you need to quickly generate a bunch of different concept maybe for a client ?,technology
then large turbo is your go to .,technology
because it is all about speed churning out those image super fast .,technology
for someone i do not know a graphic designer with a tight deadline .,technology
you could mock up a whole website banner in minute trying out different idea and composition without waiting forever for those image to render .,technology
i can definitely see how that would be a game changer for a lot of people .,technology
but what about those project that need more detail more finesse ?,technology
where you need to control every aspect of the image. . and thats where stable diffusion three.five large come in .,technology
it is more of a balance between speed and quality. . still significantly faster than the older version .,technology
but you get more control over the final result .,technology
imagine you are creating a super detailed illustration maybe for a childrens book ?,technology
large would let you carefully craft each element make sure the image is exactly how you want it .,technology
it is almost large turbo is having a fast sketch artist .,technology
and then large is working with a master painter who taking their time to get all those detail .,technology
that is a great analogy .,technology
and the best part is you get to choose which approach work best for what you need .,technology
thats fantastic .,technology
but then on top of all that there the whole open source aspect of this release ?,technology
thats going to be pretty huge for the community .,technology
it is a game changer no doubt .,technology
by making stable diffusion three.five open source stability .,technology
ai ha invited everyone to participate in the development and evolution of this technology .,technology
it is not about using these tool .,technology
it is about contributing to them a . exactly .,technology
now developer can build their own custom tool and plugins for stable diffusion .,technology
artist can share their own unique workflow and technique .,technology
and researcher they can dive deep into that code and explore new possibility .,technology
i can see how that open collaboration would lead to faster innovation and much richer creative ecosystem .,technology
yeah absolutely .,technology
instead of a single company driving the development weve got this global community ?,technology
all these passionate people pushing those boundary of whats possible .,technology
it is think of the early day of the internet .,technology
when all that information became freely accessible it led to an explosion of creativity and innovation .,technology
i see where you are going with this .,technology
this could shake thing up not for artist and developer but for anyone who us image in their work .,technology
and this is the beginning a more people get their hand on stable diffusion three.five we are going to see even more creative and innovative application popping up everywhere .,technology
this is exciting stuff .,technology
it is a very interesting time to be part of ai image generation .,technology
it feel we are on the verge of something truly transformative .,technology
but before we get too ahead of ourselves i think we should dive a little deeper into some of the specific of this release .,technology
you mentioned how open source is going to allow developer to build custom tool .,technology
what tool are we talking about ?,technology
what are the possibility ?,technology
thats a great question .,technology
let start with something called a control net. . control net .,technology
ive heard that term but i am not entirely sure what it is .,technology
how doe it work with stable diffusion three.five ?,technology
think of control net a a way to give stable diffusion more guidance more direction when it is generating an image .,technology
you are essentially giving it extra information to help it understand the structure and composition that you want .,technology
it is giving the ai a set of blueprint .,technology
thats a great analogy .,technology
and with stable diffusion three.five those capability have been significantly enhanced. . there a wider variety of control net model now each designed to help you achieve different creative effect .,technology
what effect ?,technology
imagine you want to generate an image of a person in a specific pose ?,technology
with control net you could provide stable diffusion with a simple sketch of that pose and itll use that to generate an image that match what you had in mind .,technology
i could sketch a stick figure doing a handstand and stable diffusion would create a realistic image of a person in that exact pose .,technology
and it is not pose .,technology
you can use control net to guide everything from the overall composition of the image to the style and texture of the element within it .,technology
that sound incredibly powerful .,technology
are there any limit to what you can do with this ?,technology
the possibility are id say pretty vast .,technology
and with stable diffusion three.five being open source we can expect those developer to push those boundary even further .,technology
we are already seeing some creative application of control net from generating image that match specific lighting scheme to illustration that mimic the style of famous artist .,technology
it sound control net is opening up a whole new world for artist and anyone who want to create unique imagery .,technology
but i have to admit i am still wrapping my head around how this all work .,technology
can you break down the technical side a little bit ?,technology
how doe control net interact with stable diffusion ?,technology
at it core stable diffusion is a neural network thats been trained on a massive data set of image ?,technology
when you give it a text prompt it us that to generate a new image that match your description .,technology
control net add another layer of information on top of that text prompt .,technology
it is saying here the general idea but stay within these line .,technology
and those line can be anything from a symbol sketch to a complex 3d model .,technology
control net is essentially giving the ai a more detailed roadmap making sure that the final image is more aligned with your vision .,technology
and with stable diffusion three.five the way control net interacts with that neural network ha been refined and improved .,technology
this is all fascinating stuff .,technology
but i have a feeling we are scratching the surface here .,technology
there got to be more to this update ?,technology
you are absolutely .,technology
we havent even touched on some of the other key feature of stable diffusion three.five the improvement to image quality and all the new safety feature .,technology
it sound weve got a lot more to discus .,technology
there a whole world of creative possibility to explore .,technology
i am already looking forward to it .,technology
a am i. picking up where we left off let talk about image quality .,technology
it is one thing to have ai that can make image quickly but those image have to be good too .,technology
something youd use for a real project. . yeah .,technology
speed without quality .,technology
it is i do not know having a fancy sport car with no engine .,technology
might look impressive but it is not going to get you very far .,technology
and thats one of the area where stable diffusion three.five shine i think .,technology
they made some significant improvement to the core algorithm .,technology
the image you get are better sharper more detailed more realistic than ever before .,technology
we are not talking about making image faster .,technology
we are talking about better image period .,technology
absolutely. . whats changed ?,technology
how do they do it ?,technology
one of the key improvement is in something called coherency .,technology
not sure i am familiar with that term .,technology
what doe that mean exactly ?,technology
we are talking about ai image generation .,technology
sure it mean the image make sense .,technology
the different part of the image are arranged logically .,technology
there consistency to the overall aesthetic .,technology
in the earlier version of stable diffusion you might have gotten image where i do not know thing looked a bit off .,technology
jumbled or disjointed a dog with three leg or a house with a window floating in midair .,technology
but those kind of error are way le common with stable diffusion three.five .,technology
the ai understands those relationship between object better .,technology
thats got to be huge especially if you are using ai for something graphic design or illustration .,technology
you need those image to look professional and polished .,technology
you can not have say a website banner with weird perspective or a childrens book illustration where the character are all distorted .,technology
these improvement to coherency they are bridging that gap between ai generated image and what a human would create .,technology
and it is a trend we are seeing in ai image generation in general .,technology
it is getting harder and harder to tell the difference between what a human made and what came from a machine .,technology
that doe raise all sort of interesting question but i think well save those for another time .,technology
for now though i do want to talk about the safety feature in stable diffusion three.five .,technology
this ha been a hot topic in the ai community and it is good to see stability ai taking it .,technology
yeah for sure .,technology
ai is powerful and we need to use it responsibly. . with stable diffusion three.five there a big emphasis on preventing harmful or inappropriate content from being generated .,technology
you are saying theyve built in safeguard to stop people from using it to create thing that could be offensive or dangerous .,technology
the algorithm are trained now to recognize and flag certain kind of imagery .,technology
and there are system in place to prevent those image from even being made in the first place .,technology
what imagery are they trying to block ?,technology
thing hate speech violence sexually explicit content .,technology
those are all thing stable diffusion three.five is designed to avoid .,technology
it is about making sure this technology is used for good not to cause harm. . and it is an ongoing process a this technology change .,technology
will the safety feature ?,technology
it is that balance ?,technology
between pushing the boundary and while making sure we stay within ethical line .,technology
walking a tightrope almost .,technology
but we have to walk it .,technology
if we want to see ai reach it full potential .,technology
and it say a lot about stability ai that they are taking this .,technology
they are not releasing this technology and hoping for the best .,technology
they are actively working to make sure it is used in a safe and responsible way .,technology
that is reassuring to hear .,technology
it is good to remember that even with cutting edge technology this there are human behind it ?,technology
making decision about how it get developed and used .,technology
and those human are listening to the concern of the community trying to address them .,technology
thats what make open source powerful .,technology
it is not about making the technology available .,technology
it is about that transparency that collaboration .,technology
everyone ha a voice in how it is shaped .,technology
and it is that collaboration thats going to drive the success of this technology ultimately .,technology
when you have all these different perspective different voice contributing you end up with something much stronger .,technology
the old saying two head are better than one .,technology
or in this case maybe thousand of head .,technology
and with stable diffusion three.five we are seeing what that collective intelligence can do .,technology
it is remarkable when you think about it .,technology
this incredibly powerful technology being developed out in the open .,technology
contribution from all over the world .,technology
it is a real testament to that human spirit of innovation is not it ?,technology
it is .,technology
and it make you wonder what other incredible breakthrough are around the corner .,technology
waiting to be discovered by this global community .,technology
thats a great question .,technology
and i for one am excited to find out .,technology
but for now i think well have to leave it there .,technology
weve covered a lot havent we ?,technology
all the technical stuff the new feature the image quality improvement the safety measure .,technology
but i think it is also important to step back .,technology
look at the big picture .,technology
what doe all this mean for the future ?,technology
how is stable diffusion three.five going to impact the world ?,technology
not in ai but beyond that .,technology
yeah thats a great point .,technology
and it is a question with some pretty far reaching implication ?,technology
we are talking about tech that could .,technology
democratize creativity empower people in way we havent seen before .,technology
it is giving everyone a superpower then .,technology
being able to create whatever image they can imagine without needing year of training or ton of expensive equipment .,technology
imagine anyone with a story to tell a product to design or even a message to share can now make amazing visuals to go with it .,technology
thats the power here .,technology
it is almost i do not know the printing press of the 21st century .,technology
the printing press change how we communicate stable diffusion could change how we create and even experience visual content .,technology
and that change is already happening .,technology
we are seeing stable diffusion used in many industry .,technology
advertising marketing education entertainment .,technology
how are people using it ?,technology
in marketing company are using it to create eye catching stuff for their website social medium even product packaging .,technology
it let them make unique content without needing to spend a fortune on photo shoot or graphic design .,technology
thats huge for small business startup anyone who doesnt have the budget for a big creative team .,technology
it level the playing field give everyone access to those high quality visuals .,technology
what about education ?,technology
how is it impacting how we teach and learn ?,technology
teacher are using it to create visual aid for their lesson bringing complex idea to life in a way that student respond to .,technology
i bet it is great for subject i do not know science and history where being able to see something can make a big difference .,technology
and it is not teacher making content .,technology
student are using it to expressing their creativity exploring idea in new way .,technology
it is giving them a digital art studio there in their classroom .,technology
and thats the start .,technology
we are seeing it used in architecture design helping professional quickly prototype and visualize their concept .,technology
we are not talking about pretty picture .,technology
it is about solving problem driving innovation. . and a it keep evolving we are going to see even more us more impact .,technology
it is a pretty exciting time .,technology
it is .,technology
but with all the positive stuff we also need to be realistic .,technology
there are potential downside ?,technology
challenge or risk that come with a technology this powerful .,technology
thats a good point .,technology
with any powerful tool there the potential for misuse ? .,technology
one concern is that it could be used to create i do not know misleading content deep fake propaganda thing that .,technology
that is a serious issue .,technology
we have to be aware of that .,technology
and thats why it is crucial to have these open conversation think critically about the ethic how to prevent thing from going wrong .,technology
it is with any new tech there a learning curve figuring out how to use it responsibly make sure it benefit everyone .,technology
and thats a responsibility that fall on all of u . developer artist policymakers everyone we got to work together to shape this tech .,technology
it is a collaborative effort how stable diffusion wa created. . and that collaboration need to go beyond the tech stuff .,technology
we need to be talking about the ethical social even the economic impact .,technology
it is but we can not ignore it .,technology
and on that note i think it is time to wrap up our look at stable diffusion three.five .,technology
it is been a fascinating conversation .,technology
weve talked about a lot the technical side the bigger societal impact .,technology
and i think the main takeaway is this is the beginning .,technology
stable diffusion three.five is a window into the future of creativity where imagination and technology come together .,technology
and we are getting started .,technology
the possibility are endless .,technology
thats all the time we have for today .,technology
thanks for joining u . be sure to visit our website techandainews.com for more .,technology
and well see you next time .,technology
i do not know flowing the way you want it to do .,technology
yeah it is a long a you can explain it in layman term what you want done .,technology
yes a lot of time people can not do that. . they are i do not know .,technology
i wanted to work .,technology
how do you want it to work ?,technology
on a different possibility .,technology
i wanted to find out a little bit more about what you do and how since we have different business and i have different podcasts which one might be a fit for what you do .,technology
yeah what i do i am a stress burnout mindset coach because that all work together .,technology
i am not i am not i am a coach who work with mindset and burnout because there are one hundred connected .,technology
and yeah and i know you love the technology .,technology
and that make me working in a different way because i use two type of technology in my work .,technology
one is i think you are known with that because i saw in the connection that you have two people working with that .,technology
especially in the world of your crazy .,technology
thats the hard coherence .,technology
and the other one is quantum technology thats not known yet in the u . that it is there .,technology
the way at least we do it .,technology
in the quantum technology make it completely different because coaching go a lot faster .,technology
we make it all visible at the moment that it is all going and we can measure a lot .,technology
that make it much more fun to coach people. . yep .,technology
whats the quantum technology ?,technology
tell me about that .,technology
you were talking about heart math with heart rate coherence ?,technology
heart math thats all the technology .,technology
thats the one that is using a sensor to measure your heart rate .,technology
and it is not how many beat a minute .,technology
but there supposed to be a certain balance in that heart rate .,technology
and there a lot of information connected to that .,technology
how the whole body work the brain the hormone the body thing that .,technology
now the other the quantum technology that i work with is completely different from that .,technology
and it is fifty year of research a it is pure science .,technology
and it started fifty year ago in the u went to the sneaky went to russia and it is used in the cosmonaut program .,technology
and then in the berlin wall time when that one fell down wa broken down .,technology
a lot of those professor fled to germany and there they developed this even a lot more and it is medical certified by now .,technology
and it is measuring the bio photon which are the smallest particle of energy and it can measure that up till dna level .,technology
every cell can be measured .,technology
and we look in there where is the energy out of balance ?,technology
it show it all on the screen .,technology
and when it is out of balance we can search quick .,technology
whats the reason ?,technology
is it radiation ?,technology
is it food ?,technology
the broccoli is not good but the cauliflower which is almost the same is good .,technology
of course thats thats precise .,technology
but also what i work most with a a mindset coach is what believe out of what time of your life is active at this moment and blocking the energy making it imbalanced .,technology
it also show you away what psychoemotional pattern is there .,technology
it is holistic working .,technology
it is impossible to search for disease .,technology
i do not work with that .,technology
i am not a doctor i stay far away from that .,technology
but yeah it is there all all disease do have a psychoemotional reason underneath .,technology
and that is what we can look into though .,technology
working getting those belief clear those unconscious belief and what is the imprint on dna level ?,technology
we can find that all within one click on the on the computer .,technology
within half an hour we know the whole thing thats going on in somebody mind and somebody life .,technology
we know how the whole energy is in the whole body how the hormone balance is all that stuff .,technology
and we even can help from that technology to balance energy but also to make a chip where we can put frequency on .,technology
frequency therapy put that on there and somebody wearing that and it help .,technology
but it give you information about certain thing that you can use the buck blussen therapy or homeopathic stuff what mineral you need .,technology
it is also going exactly in what is still needed to upgrade the body .,technology
it is extensive .,technology
it give people an exact food list they can use and we can even choose .,technology
do we want that on let say the stomach because that one is most out of balance ?,technology
or are we taking the whole torso because the whole torso is how out of balance all the organ ?,technology
we can choose that .,technology
and then it is always it is fun to connect all the dot with all the different picture that we get to connect the dot with the theme that are there .,technology
it is exciting .,technology
people are always flabbergasted when they see it .,technology
and it is because it is go that quick .,technology
now people have to be in person for that ?,technology
ill scan all over the world because it is quantum .,technology
it is if you would use your phone and you would call me you away see my face you hear my voice .,technology
it is all a it is and it is there within a second .,technology
how doe that work ?,technology
we do not know because it is energy frequency .,technology
it is all frequency .,technology
i only need either a picture or we have a dna box that we can use a little bit of hair or something .,technology
we put that in the dna box but i also can use a picture and then write all the name address and all those thing on that picture .,technology
and do not ask me how thats what hundred of scientist have discovered .,technology
if i would have that from you and then which can you you will see within fifteen minute it is all about you .,technology
and it is amazing .,technology
thats from my place here .,technology
i work all over the world which is fun .,technology
it is fun .,technology
yeah ive worked with .,technology
it is chromophotography .,technology
when i wa working with shaka khan her sister had this device that they couldnt figure out how to use .,technology
and thats what it doe .,technology
did chromophotography and wa also a russian scientist from the 50 that helped develop this .,technology
but it created whatever your auric field wa from the tip of all ten finger .,technology
because each finger represents one portion of the auric field .,technology
and then from that the software would then deduce you were saying you use chinese medicine chart and it would show you what part of the body wa not functioning .,technology
and what wa funny is every thing that we knew about any of the people that i scanned it wa it would show up .,technology
but then there were thing that would show up with the pancreas or gallbladder or other thing that they did not know were causing a challenge. . and then i am your other symptom that weve talked about thats exactly what would be the cause of that .,technology
yeah you need to eat thing that are going to or supplement with thing that are going to help that .,technology
reverse or heal itself .,technology
yeah there a lot of technology now .,technology
and i am happy that this is the only technology that show all the belief from early on .,technology
the thousand of belief that are there and then are they active or are they not active ?,technology
are they in your way ?,technology
and thats yeah for me a a mindset coach thats the most fun to work with that part .,technology
yeah i do that with heartmath .,technology
i do not know if youve ever played with it but especially when people are nonbeliever of that it is functioning is i put it on them and use it a lie detector test .,technology
if i know them enough ill say thing about a person or thing that i know are going to be trigger for them ?,technology
and take them into uncoherence .,technology
and then ill say thing about people that i know that they love or animal that i know that they love and watch it .,technology
it go where it is supposed to and they are and then they are they can not they can not dispute ?,technology
what it is .,technology
and yeah it is pretty cool .,technology
then they want then they start wanting to play with it .,technology
and they are figuring out that thats whats going to get them to connect with that part ?,technology
they were ignoring .,technology
yeah yeah i used to heartmath together with what i do .,technology
i every disease every energy out of balance ha stress underneath it .,technology
having having the stress in straightening your face that is what it show people what is instead of what they feel .,technology
and that probably too between what we feel and whats there there a huge difference .,technology
i trade seven and a half thousand people including the big part of the police force here in the netherlands .,technology
and yeah with those people i know i am relaxed that they have this sensor on and they are one hundred in stress reaction .,technology
they can not go around it .,technology
and thats the fun that you showed on the screen .,technology
they can not go around it anymore. . and i love that .,technology
yes we are going to have many people live in that state .,technology
consistently that they do not even realize what it is to be in a relaxed state or in a peaceful state of mind or state of spirit .,technology
it is hard to find anybody these day who wa who wa in a relaxed state .,technology
thats a challenge to search for those people .,technology
yeah i think they have to detach a little bit .,technology
at least i should speak to myself .,technology
i have to detach for a little bit before i can get that away .,technology
and it even even when i am i would say it is been a long time probably five year since ive sat and detach for more than a week .,technology
where i could not have to deal with my phone or my email or my any of those thing .,technology
i had a retreat and i wa i had brought my computer but it wasnt open for nine day .,technology
yeah thats beautiful .,technology
it wa great .,technology
the last time i did that wa a flow genome project .,technology
when we went they it wa for five day on the top of powder mountain in utah .,technology
and they did not have phone charger and stuff .,technology
they had one main area where they had thing and then they had a little solar thing to put their light in the tent .,technology
but it wa they were nice ten but it wa still and it is with a sleeping bag ?,technology
and yeah it wa in fact at the end of it it wa funny because my roommate and i were you five day to go .,technology
i am whatd you say you do for a living again ?,technology
he tell me what he doe .,technology
he would he ended up he wa a tv producer and had done different stuff with br .,technology
and we ended up even doing some business and work together afterwards .,technology
an esports hackathon .,technology
but yes it is interesting how when you do not have that trigger in front of you that you have to go to do business .,technology
when you do not have your phone you are i know i do not have any where to put this .,technology
you turn off business mode and everybody wa there doing more self discovery and more enriching of their skill set .,technology
but that wa my last time when i got to do that where we unplugged everywhere else .,technology
i still had access to my phone .,technology
i wa no i said i am not turning on my phone for three or four day .,technology
that did not happen .,technology
yeah we have that wish .,technology
i would love to i think from what you told me maybe talk about what you do and your special system on a podcast and how that biofeedback stuff work .,technology
yeah that would be a good idea because we could record that part and then talk about it during the show because we could show some part of it .,technology
that would be cool .,technology
yeah that would be cool .,technology
yeah let me a little advertisement for you later .,technology
i did not think of that part of that possibility but yeah i love that too .,technology
thats why we do our podcast several different reason .,technology
we teach other coach to do this too is that i am you are able to trade audience connect to new people a a find new for me i knew modality that could help the people with the same kind of thing that ive gone through .,technology
mainly i teach people how to deal with stomach challenge and pain related challenge .,technology
my sleeping challenge all come from hurting myself and waking up with back pain or having to go to the bathroom or all these different other little thing ?,technology
that lot of people have .,technology
yeah sound familiar. . and figuring out what can i do or what am i not doing that will help change this pattern and behavior .,technology
and thats all i do is use what i call the compounding effect that my grandpa taught me of doing a little bit every day and or a little bit more .,technology
and if you keep doing that every single day that in not too long a period of time it make a huge difference in where you are .,technology
he taught u to do that with finance but i figured out when i hurt myself that the same thing applies to investing in our body in our health and probably more than money because .,technology
yeah i think it is hard to see .,technology
most people can not put the two and two together .,technology
and even when we get one part of it usually we are getting other part wrong .,technology
it is we are always growing .,technology
yeah thats the good part of the about the agreement to be looking at that one .,technology
that we always continually improve. . i am already busy forty year to keep growing .,technology
every time again i realized i know i accept it .,technology
i think even after i am dead i will keep growing somehow .,technology
yeah it doesnt end but it is fun though .,technology
i do not see it a a problem or heavy or whatever .,technology
it can be challenging but i see it a fun to keep growing .,technology
whats your newest thing that you are learning now ?,technology
at the moment i have a lot of focus on the marketing to getting client .,technology
since i also went to the united state instead of state not living but working .,technology
that is my challenge to have to set it .,technology
yeah to get the client would also to get it known there because what i do is not knowing there yet .,technology
how to get that out in a good way and attract people that way .,technology
thats the biggest challenge .,technology
and i am being coached on that but it is still a challenge .,technology
let say that .,technology
we can help you with that too .,technology
thats one of the thing that we built and what ive done my whole life .,technology
they said why do not you come work here ?,technology
i got to work at this amazing place .,technology
they paid for my master degree .,technology
and that ha a lot to do with the different music thing that i do now .,technology
ive been involved with .,technology
when we first started trying to hire the mentor team that we had trained with because i guess we got the training pedro adéu who doe the challenge .,technology
he did tony robbins and .,technology
she had a sumter .,technology
any of the people that are big in this self .,technology
coaching or coaching industry .,technology
he usually worked on their challenge wrigley gum .,technology
he worked with their stuff .,technology
weve been big corporation .,technology
and then .,technology
i stand again and another speaking coach .,technology
but what we found wa that .,technology
that the system wa that they were trying to use .,technology
they are putting together two or three or four different system ?,technology
and they did not all the people on the team did not know how to use all the thing .,technology
and it wa we are continually in learning mode with them .,technology
each time for something and nothing would ever work .,technology
and three year ago we started our own system .,technology
thats what into market is .,technology
is a system that will .,technology
mark it through your social medium platform .,technology
and your text in your email and keep it all in one place .,technology
and then we built a different business in a box .,technology
a the email and text template .,technology
that whether it is a coach or .,technology
we even have it for lawyer and doctor and dentist because also .,technology
a lot of the coach coach in their profession .,technology
and they are still going to our real estate agent thats a coach .,technology
shes now certified to coach people .,technology
and she want to coach them in anything which she can. . but .,technology
you can not tell people i can coach you in anything .,technology
and have people think you are going to be an expert at anything .,technology
you have to pick what you are good at .,technology
and thats what i am coaching her through is .,technology
you already are an expert in real estate .,technology
you already helped people with their finance .,technology
here the niche that i see that you already do .,technology
and i would recommend that you pick one of them and market that .,technology
thats what we did with her .,technology
have a separate website for her real estate .,technology
but then a separate one for coaching .,technology
and how it deal mainly with finance .,technology
but our system work in english and spanish .,technology
and the front end and back end because i said my fiance most of her coaching stuff is in spanish .,technology
and then we do thing i put qr code in there we can use those in organic .,technology
we have a direct connection back to the platform .,technology
but yeah id love for you to check that out .,technology
you are looking for a marketing platform .,technology
i do not know which one you are using now but i think it is the best under little prejudice .,technology
yeah i am using linkedin mostly now .,technology
at least i wa on focusing that i am focus out one .,technology
thats what i would recommend if linkedin is one of the better one .,technology
linkedin and instagram for coach .,technology
but then thats also one of the nice thing with our system too you can create content and then put it on through the social calendar .,technology
a who sweet .,technology
you can put it on all the different channel that you want .,technology
and if you are going to do any facebook and google ad we are doing with the sleep challenge it track all that too and keep it all in one place .,technology
weve got chatbots that go on the website or on web page on the messenger for facebook all that stuff that drive people to make an appointment .,technology
because what you want is people to be able to get the basic information that they need from you .,technology
go through any question and then you want to schedule a call with them you can see if they are a good fit for you .,technology
and if you can support them with what your service are and if not where you would refer them to at least thats what i do .,technology
if it is not a fit for me .,technology
thats i think to do it at scale is what becomes hard for coach .,technology
she ended up now i am making call because we got done with an event for my fiance .,technology
and she ha eighty people that all want to talk to her .,technology
that she had and i started my sleeping challenge and it is free .,technology
but we turned on the ad and we are only doing fifty a day .,technology
and we already had ten sign ups .,technology
the average one is costing about four a piece now .,technology
but those are the thing that once the metric ?,technology
and ive done this a few time .,technology
now you start to feel comfortable .,technology
now i know if i put five hundred into ad this time when i do my whatever it is going to be i am going to get two hundred people and thats going to keep me busy for however long .,technology
again unless you automate the system for sign up which you can and thats what we teach people how to do too is now you got these lead .,technology
now you are going to sit through and do the sale call to you .,technology
to build a script .,technology
because then once you have a script now you can have someone else do the preliminary to qualify them to make sure that they are the person .,technology
and you can either do that through a storm or through a series of video too .,technology
we even use ai avatar we can feed script into our system where you do not have to go and record thing every time .,technology
he did one for me where it is this is sleeping challenge and it is me .,technology
and put my hand in the prayer position a i tell them the ending of the program dude thats funny .,technology
i that .,technology
thats because i wa doing those thing when i created that avatar ?,technology
it it us my different expression and it get the end .,technology
it is i hope you come and have this meditation that worked out .,technology
i am i am and it is funny because you can tell it is you can tell it is not me .,technology
you tell it is an avatar but it look good .,technology
you are this is funny .,technology
this is cool .,technology
and thats how we are playing with it too .,technology
it is to use it in certain place to make thing more efficient .,technology
you can try to convey a message .,technology
weve already got them signed up and you are trying to keep them engaged ?,technology
until the event start .,technology
then they can all participate because part of what that ive learned and that weve learned is that a lot of the best insight from people come in the group coaching .,technology
and all of a sudden you are thats me .,technology
and they do not see it .,technology
and now i see what everybodys been telling me .,technology
yeah i love that part of that .,technology
thats group .,technology
thats what i want .,technology
i want to start a group too .,technology
to have those effect a but also to make it easier for myself. . cool .,technology
i can send you a free trial to ours if you are interested in that .,technology
or we have a fifty discount for partner that we are doing now too .,technology
i could i said share either one of those with you or both .,technology
but did you tell me what you said you are using linkedin you are not using any crm now ?,technology
no i am planning to because the coach that i am having now she also ha a whole system thing that i want to start and that ha the crm the mail course everything in it .,technology
and it is also one platform .,technology
i am what one it is ?,technology
which one it is ?,technology
she made it she developed it herself .,technology
it is from jeanhan lor .,technology
i do not think she ha a certain name for it or something. . i know she hasnt developed not completely herself but you have people developing it for her whole system .,technology
cool. . i would say if that ha any challenge or you may want to share i do not know what it look .,technology
i do not know yet either since shes not in there yet .,technology
but yeah i would not be able to give you advice on that since ive done that for a while .,technology
thats a nice one .,technology
i do not know how to help you with that .,technology
but if you have problem i am here and i can be happy to at least share with you my opinion of what the strength and weakness are .,technology
but also i would say if shes got a system that she already us and shes going to coach you it would make sense to use her system .,technology
thanks jo too .,technology
because she also ha the complete help in there that doesnt cost u anything .,technology
some new help .,technology
yeah we have that too .,technology
we have a twenty fourhour twenty fourseven chat support a a zoom support on ours and it is in english and spanish .,technology
let me know .,technology
and is she still building it ?,technology
no she ha it already ready .,technology
she did build it i think more than a year ago .,technology
when you get a chance to share that with me because i always to see what else is out there and if there feature and function i can add to mine that i do not have .,technology
she will not be happy then .,technology
i do not think ... anyone in business thats afraid of competition is not playing the game my opinion because there many good idea and good thing .,technology
it is a good coach .,technology
you are going to find one that you resonate with that can teach you the thing that you need to learn from them that they are good at teaching and usually you are going to lead the rest anyways .,technology
yeah you can not absorb everything that they have and usually not everythings for you at least for me .,technology
knowing what to take thats for me is part of the experience .,technology
thats upset at the time .,technology
what do i need to give you to do the picture ?,technology
any picture ?,technology
can you take one off my website or linkedin or do you need me to give you a specific a picture ?,technology
for ... you said you wanted to do for the podcast .,technology
i did not know we were transferred to this camp .,technology
i thought i do i need you a picture for the podcast .,technology
yeah what ?,technology
that maybe come a little bit closer to the screen .,technology
ill see if that work .,technology
if i make it from here i need your face more in there .,technology
yeah a little bit further away because now it is it is a camera going completely around .,technology
a little bit back from the camera .,technology
you are going to enjoy your day still ?,technology
i am going to finish up the podcast .,technology
the edge is an exciting place full of new technology or existing technology that are being brought together in new and exciting way .,technology
this is a melting pot of technology at the edge .,technology
this episode of the tech field day podcast feature jon osmond guy currier ivan mcphee and myself alistair cook describing the melting pot that is edge computing .,technology
welcome to the tech field day podcast where we bring together a group of it technical expert to discus a single topic about key concept in the industry .,technology
this podcast feature a variety of perspective from member of the tech field day delicate community and is often recorded in association with our tech field day event .,technology
tech field day is a part of the futurum group and this podcast is also published with our sister company tech strong tv .,technology
in this episode of the podcast recorded live at edge field day well be discussing the premise .,technology
the edge is the new melting pot of technology .,technology
before the discussion let meet who on the panel today .,technology
ivan mcphee i am delighted to have you on this panel at your very first tech field day event .,technology
tell u a little bit about yourself .,technology
thanks a lot for having me .,technology
great to meet everybody and to be able to be part of this day .,technology
i am focused on the security and networking sector .,technology
and john .,technology
i primarily work with networking and interconnection and thing of that nature in the hinterland .,technology
and guy ?,technology
i am cto of visible impact and you can see my work at futurumgroup.com .,technology
i think this idea that the edge is a melting pot of technology is something that weve seen a weve been experiencing the presentation here at edge field day .,technology
now we are at the end of day one .,technology
weve had three of the presentation .,technology
i am sure well see more of the melting pot next week .,technology
but weve already seen the melding of having container for your application along with using those container to deploy virtual machine out at the edge .,technology
and we are seeing a variety of technology there .,technology
we saw thing machine learning being operated on very small edge device .,technology
now i liked that the example given wa a conventional ai where it wa image recognition using open cv inside of frigate .,technology
some of the tool that you might have been using for some time to build actual ai application long before this large language model came along and vastly increased our resource need .,technology
but then we saw a vast amount of resource being delivered out into an edge .,technology
we saw the ability to add huge amount of storage and huge amount of offload for ai to your existing edge host .,technology
and we saw quite a lot of different technology being glued together to answer a variety of different requirement .,technology
john you are particularly focused on networking .,technology
do that networking stack getting pushed into the edge component and being glued together ?,technology
it is a little difficult sometimes in some of the smaller city in rural area that do not have a lot of connectivity .,technology
and a number of the place are starting to get a lot of grant money and thing of that nature to build out middle mile piece and some last mile into their into the city .,technology
and if you have to ship it off from rural new mexico to chicago for that work to get done the answer will not get that fast enough .,technology
there a whole melding together there of a john deere not the conventional tractor but a robotic tractor and a whole bunch of laser .,technology
this is the awesome part of whats going on out at some of the edge .,technology
we are not going to use chemical to deal with weed .,technology
we are going to zap them with laser .,technology
guy would you to be zapped with a laser today ?,technology
a soon a i identify whether that plant is a weed or not you can zap away .,technology
and then on the other hand what you did not mention is there a lot more flexibility that we see in platform architecture form factor and forth .,technology
some of the form factor is required by the condition but the other thing is that there seem to be a lot more there a lot more of an ability to build proprietary platform .,technology
you do not have to worry a much thinking of the processor a it being x86 or arm or anything else .,technology
weve seen a lot more variety there .,technology
you put those together and that is the melting pot for different looking even a a full rack cluster out in the field might be significantly different from anything youd seen in data center .,technology
and the vendor are finding way to still allow those to interface back into the core .,technology
i wouldnt call the edge in melting for all .,technology
i think what we are doing is we are shifting stuff we shifted from the data center to the cloud now we are shifting it to the edge because it changed in the form factor .,technology
but in the end we are still doing the same stuff .,technology
we are doing it faster because it is closer to the source of the where the data is initially collected .,technology
i wouldnt necessarily say it is a melting pot i would say we are redistributing what we already have and finding different way to manage it .,technology
is that part of the fiftyyear cycle of the centralized computing to distribute it and going back to centralized and we are getting distributed again ?,technology
they are all going over your network .,technology
wheres the problem the problem ha to do with latency bandwidth availability that thing .,technology
there are a lot of shifting condition that i think ivan necessitate design change in the system themselves and that cause them to diverge and be more be more diverse in the edge .,technology
that is not the same thing to me at all of this shifting back and forth .,technology
i would be question is what piece of the edge is the most important ?,technology
is it the is it the interconnection ?,technology
because if it is the interconnection if you are talking about a cell provider most of the time your handset is being backhauled to a major city anyway .,technology
if you are trying to rely on cellular system you are not getting the latency benefit of having thing local and on at the edge .,technology
but are we seeing that there is the again the melting pot this idea that the mobile device are melding with the device at the edge .,technology
and you are getting something that ha a mobile device architecture itll often have a mobile device cpu and may have the offloads from mobile device ?,technology
and the problem we are trying to solve here is not one of weve got a very small number of huge cluster .,technology
and this is absolutely a vast of story .,technology
you are not managing a single huge cluster or a small number of huge cluster .,technology
and the tool that are good for managing a single huge cluster are terrible for managing a massively distributed collection of thing that probably do not even need to be cluster .,technology
we definitely see this there a different set of requirement that are going to drive a different set of solution .,technology
but are we seeing the element that make up these solution getting melted together a the software and the hardware getting glued together more a the connectivity and the user interface getting glued which bit are melting together into this weird crowd ?,technology
melting them into the same pot grind me that through the year moore law ha given u infinite computing for all intent and purpose and infinite and infinite memory .,technology
everything weve been doing ha been nobody care about the individual cycle anymore because weve got many of them they throw thing at that .,technology
if we go further is the edge going to be into your phone ?,technology
are we going to start having people that were dedicating part of our phone to to somebody use that they can push that edge piece to u when we when we subscribe to their service ?,technology
i see in the end the edge is dependent upon the network .,technology
a far a i am concerned the more you push thing out and press on the edge the more important the network becomes .,technology
and we even see a lot of application that were in the cloud being taken back into the data center in order to power thing at the edge .,technology
therefore the network becomes the key thing .,technology
and in the end every single edge device purely becomes an endpoint delivering certain capability which in the end is dependent upon the network to be able to present a big picture for organization .,technology
and yet we want our application to still run at that edge when a snowstorm come in and take out all of our fixed line networking .,technology
and all of the cellular network are then overloaded by people trying to contact one another or those cell site go down because they are covered in ice .,technology
and one of the characteristic we see at edge though is the need for autonomous disconnected operation survivability .,technology
not a dependence on something thats in the cloud and the data center for selling another gallon of gas because youve got to fill up your generator at this time .,technology
hopefully you got your generator filled earlier filled early .,technology
but if youve got no diesel no petrol left in your generator you need to be able to buy petrol in the middle of the snowstorm .,technology
and if it relies on the network being up .,technology
thats why i enjoyed chriss illustration this morning about his child .,technology
his child wa at home used to have to make sure it is he brush teeth before he went to school had all his book packed that thing .,technology
now a a university it is a case of you do not brush your teeth you will not get the girlfriend .,technology
if you do not do your homework youll want to pas your pas the syllabus ?,technology
and then therefore we move stuff out of the data center to the edge .,technology
yes survivability is important .,technology
but in the end survivability is only there for a limited period of time .,technology
and then the connectivity ha to resume in order for u to be able to have something that work .,technology
but to me what necessitates this melting pot approach ?,technology
the application categorized a edge application would you say that they are more stringent in their requirement ultimately in order to run properly compared to any application or generally application that can run in the cloud or run in the data center ?,technology
are there more requirement for edge application ?,technology
i do not have very much dependence upon the sector ?,technology
if you look at industry you look at manufacturing you look at twenty four hour manufacturing for instance yes there ha to be stringent requirement for those thing .,technology
but thats not applicable for all thing .,technology
for instance you go back to the illustration about having a look at crop ?,technology
the latency requirement for that is a lot le than in manufacturing plant .,technology
and therefore all the pen are pointing exactly what the application is and the sector thats using it .,technology
my contention is that with the additional requirement the physical requirement security requirement connectivity requirement some of which may be low but there still requirement .,technology
you are having this piling on of requirement .,technology
thats what drive the melting pot .,technology
but i guess what you are saying ivan is that it doe drive the melting pot in some case but it doe not drive any melting pot in others .,technology
there you have the answer to the question both yes and no .,technology
this is a perfect podcast .,technology
we are returning to the consultant answer of yes but it depends .,technology
yeah very good .,technology
i observe this diversity of platform both software platform and hardware platform including networking that i do not feel exists a much in either the cloud or the data center where there a certain drive towards uniformity for management purpose management and operation purpose .,technology
there the same drive towards uniformity in an edge application .,technology
it is that the limit of that are greater because of those requirement .,technology
but i guess to your point that doesnt apply in a generally a i thought .,technology
thats one of the one of the vendor that presented the avastra .,technology
thats why i enjoyed what they presented because it allows you to be able to come up with a certain level of uniformity based on containerization and push that out to the edge and manage it .,technology
it come from the containerization and then thats a hurdle for you to go over .,technology
but once youve gone there thats not a melting pot i would agree .,technology
one of the thing for the vendor thats presenting for u tomorrow our time of course last week your time zadita .,technology
and they are definitely an organization where there this real tight coupling between the hardware thats deployed out and the actual hardware configuration and the application that have been delivered on top of them .,technology
i think tomorrow we are going to get more of that story around how they melded together these different piece and how interdependent at these edge location .,technology
but is that what we are trying to look for ?,technology
we have general purpose cpu .,technology
we should be using them for general purpose .,technology
any cpu should be able to run any of these container that we want to run .,technology
i do not care if it is an arm i do not care if it is riscfive i do not care if it is x86 it ought to be able to run these thing for them .,technology
and we ought to have generic device that maybe we give them part of our phone i said earlier .,technology
maybe it is a piece of somebody car when you are driving around that youve got some excess computing capacity .,technology
thats the world of the edge .,technology
and thats a melting pot more than anything ive ever seen in my life .,technology
the idea of using whatever resource are available at the time .,technology
itd be amazing to get a faster response to the judgment of whether thats a weed or not because somebody is driving a tesla past your field at the time .,technology
thats also one of the thing i appreciate about lavassa .,technology
they had the ability to be able to do discovery of all the device on the network and based on the configuration of that device determine which edge application could be deployed on that device .,technology
and i think thats what we are looking for in the end because in the end we do not want to have to go and deploy lot of new edge device .,technology
if weve got cot server sitting out there let reuse them .,technology
do not bring in something new when whats old will do enough .,technology
and therefore by having that discovery capability and then backtracking it to exactly what can be delivered on it is a huge advantage to organization that attribute them .,technology
you are looking for a converged platform that is allowing u to deliver application without much of a dictation of whats in the remote site .,technology
i would call stephen talking about foskitt .,technology
stephen foskitt our founder talking about the day before commodity hardware where every application that wa being deployed out to a retail location had it own server and it own connection those thing have definitely been melted together into this commodity platform for running application .,technology
we are definitely seeing more containerization a another way of melding them together .,technology
that to me is the pendulum swing .,technology
i think the grand pendulum swing in this industry is more or le between infrastructure and application .,technology
the center of gravity for the center of gravity for application i guess the center of gravity for the stack the center of gravity for decision making is the application software developer adapting to the new capability of the platform or the platform enabling new software model .,technology
thats what containerization is supposed to do .,technology
and maybe we are witnessing the same thing distributed farther out to the edge .,technology
but also you think about a an application overlay which in the end is what run the business is the value to the business .,technology
the network for instance underlay becomes this underlay ?,technology
but if we can manage and track the application overlay and that determines exactly how the business is going to perform based on that value presented by it everything else becomes commodity in the end .,technology
grace hopper had a talked to the nsa in the early 80 and she wa talking about how thing were going to be moving into system of computer at the time .,technology
and she said that at the time they had a big mainframe and you had the processing power going on it and the engineering wa on it and everybody else wa on it and payroll wa on it .,technology
but a we got cheaper and cheaper computer they started getting their own system .,technology
and they could break them apart .,technology
and the idea wa now that thing are the price model is getting the point where we can break these apart and make them work better on their own everybody wa using their own computer and they got to design them the way they needed them to .,technology
but then they realized all the connection that you have to go back and forth .,technology
the underlying piece of the network talking to each other and the ability of tying all these thing together is whats going to be key in all of these .,technology
it always ha been .,technology
and i think the consanerization give u the ability to first we had virtual virtualization and now the containerization we are going to able we are going to be able to use bigger bigger computer and have multiple application running continuously that are all going to need that separation .,technology
and that allows u to be able to manage and optimize the application path a opposed to the network path .,technology
and therefore in the end everythings about the application everything we do is going to be making sure that we have the application and the underlying infrastructure that can give u the latency and the performance that we need .,technology
it is all in support of the business need that we have at the end and it is going to have to be a melting pot for everything to boil down and get to the point where it all helped .,technology
i do think that there that put a certain new level of stress or a burden and responsibility on the application designer developer and manager .,technology
and that is it own learning cycle and learning curve .,technology
that wa when i ran into today .,technology
we hit we saw people that were able to orchestrate container but some of the question that they are going to have in the long run are going to be whether or not the container is enough .,technology
the the if the actual application can not deal with the idea of part of it falling away .,technology
these are somewhat esoteric application development skill .,technology
they are extremely valuable not necessarily fully recognized until team have gotten pretty far down a development path .,technology
and thats where you can see thats where you have that experience i described about using my phone and there not enough connectivity .,technology
and on the app i am working with doesnt work that you could call that poor application development but it is an area that need to continue to mature if it is being given this power .,technology
it need to take that power .,technology
maybe i can ask you guy a question based on that .,technology
do the focus of vendor shifting on setting setting to the it folk to setting to the application folk because in the end the application is king ?,technology
i think thats the swing i wa referring to earlier .,technology
i feel very much this this weight in the last maybe two year more on the side of the application developer .,technology
and i credit and blame containerization for this .,technology
it wa the supposed easy button that the application developer can define their environment and go ahead and create their microservices based application .,technology
and the infrastructure folk the interface between the two is that the infrastructure folk are able to supply the service level required for that and they do not have to have this continuous back and forth .,technology
who should hold the purse string ?,technology
the application guy ?,technology
should the application guy be controlling the budget for the infrastructure ?,technology
or are we in a service provided place ?,technology
this way we are starting to come .,technology
of course thats thats where the rubber hit the road is not it ?,technology
because the infrastructure guy should control their infrastructure budget .,technology
the other i wa at this point then that the infrastructure guy should be the service provider for the application guy who are then service provider for the business .,technology
i should say thats the vision .,technology
thats and i hear these discussion all the time from customer who are very into containerization and into furthering modernization through containerization that they seem to take this a an easy button .,technology
and it is not .,technology
thats where i am coming from from this .,technology
not only are they being used that way they can not be used without each other .,technology
the interaction is the key to all of it .,technology
but i need a we are coming to the end of the show id each of you bring some final thought on this idea that the age is a melting pot .,technology
and ill start with guy because he clearly ha something to say .,technology
i think ivan ha demonstrated to me pretty that the scope of that melting pot is necessarily limited .,technology
in fact when i am thinking about these additional requirement which i do believe exist in almost all edge case essentially many of those requirement lead more towards let say purity than towards a melting pot approach .,technology
i do think that it is the consultant answer which is that it depends .,technology
but importantly to this discussion it depends on the application .,technology
you need to understand the application it requirement what outcome you are looking for that classic chain of value in order to know whether the melting pot approach is the approach or the strategy from your vendor .,technology
and i do not think it is the melting pot at the edge .,technology
i think it is the melting pot that empowers the edge .,technology
because in the end yes we want to deliver from the edge but everything else we have to make sure fit in with what we are looking for in business perspective .,technology
is that your final word for me ?,technology
thats my final comment .,technology
in that case john surprisingly you get to have the final word from the pen .,technology
final word would be i think it absolutely is true .,technology
it is a melting pot .,technology
we have application that have to run on top of equipment that ha to talk to each other .,technology
and if they are not all working in harmony and in this melting pot together they are not going to be able to take care of the end user that we need .,technology
and whether that is completely at the edge or sitting at a data center it is going to be a hodge podge of all of those piece .,technology
the edge ha to melt together .,technology
and i think that the melting pot ha always been here with our infrastructure and the application that reside on top .,technology
i think one of the thing that i even brought out strongly is weve got to think about what we are doing for the business .,technology
ultimately our whole purpose a the infrastructure it application developer team is to support the business to be more successful a a business .,technology
i think very importantly that understanding of your contribution how you can bring together your expertise and your knowledge and the technology that are available to you to provide those solution for business at the end .,technology
thank you for joining u at the tech field day podcast .,technology
before we go where can people continue this conversation ?,technology
i know we are going to continue this conversation later on at a social event .,technology
but if people want to contact you guy where can they find you to carry the conversation on ?,technology
gcurrierfutureum.com but i can be found on blue sky a guy currier feed and also on x at the same address .,technology
wa that guy currier feed ?,technology
feed feed my information feed .,technology
i apologize to the viewer .,technology
john where can we find this that you two carry on ?,technology
i am a little rather old fashioned .,technology
i john at ozman.net email is probably the easiest way to get a hold of me .,technology
and for me the best way is to go into linkedin and search for ivan mcphee mcphwe .,technology
of course you can always find me a alistair cook or a cook or demitas nz .,technology
if you are searching for a cook alistair cook there are a couple of other guy by that name but put some technology and youll find me .,technology

thanks for listening and well see you next week .,technology
on today episode we are going to talk about ai .,technology
we want to talk about it learn about it think about it and this is a bit much is not it ?,technology
let do it the normal way .,technology
we are a bucket of engaging and usually quite a lady .,technology
they are asking for it .,technology
everybodys talking about ai .,technology
i think that everybody but lot of people are .,technology
and i think that most of u we are curious we want to know what is it .,technology
one thing i found out ai is almost everywhere .,technology
it is been incorporated in our life for quite some time .,technology
thats not a bad thing .,technology
it is a matter of fact ai ha done and is doing lot of good thing .,technology
what i want to do in this podcast in the first part i want to take a look at all of the application or certainly a number of application of ai and way in which it is already being used in our life our daily life .,technology
and then in the second part i want to take a look at the potential problem of ai .,technology
and well try and connect some of those to some of the thing that we find to be good .,technology
first of all there is and i am saying first of all i am putting it in the order that i want to .,technology
software or methodology ai .,technology
thats where we have thing voice assistance alexa cortana do this do that .,technology
is image recognition for our face to unlock our cell phone ?,technology
it is also machinebased learning for fraud detection .,technology
and we want these thing .,technology
certainly i do not use the voice recognition .,technology
i do not the voice recognition .,technology
i am always thinking when i am using my television .,technology
i do not telling my television to turn to whatever .,technology
because i am always thinking this is a little paranoid part of me .,technology
i am always thinking i do not want it to learn my voice .,technology
you are not going to learn my voice .,technology
why is that ?,technology
what is it going to do with my voice ?,technology
i have no idea whatsoever .,technology
i am always having that thought .,technology
i am going to push the button ive always done .,technology
i am not going to tell it what to do .,technology
in another type of ai is called embodied ai .,technology
first we had the software or methodology ai .,technology
but this is the embodied ai .,technology
and we see the embodied ai in lot of place .,technology
and we are going to see it in lot more place .,technology
for example you have a drone .,technology
thats embodied ai .,technology
we see the prototype for those .,technology
i do not think there anybody out there owning a selfdriving vehicle .,technology
but i could be wrong .,technology
and then there are assembly line robot .,technology
you look in a factory .,technology
and there the robot is doing the packaging and the shipping and moving the product from the assembly line maybe to the point where they get ready to load it onto the truck .,technology
then i learned about this and see i learning about technology .,technology
i do not know a lot about technology but i love learning about it .,technology
the internet of thing .,technology
this is again when we are talking about embodied ai .,technology
thats the network of physical object or thing that are embedded with software sensor and other technology for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other device and system over the internet .,technology
for example it could be a household object .,technology
it could be sophisticated industrial equipment .,technology
it is lot of thing .,technology
but the bottom line is that they say by two thousand and twenty five there will be twenty two billion connected iot or internet of thing device .,technology
there were roughly ten billion in two thousand and twenty .,technology
and thats from oracle .,technology
this is fascinating stuff because now we are all ai .,technology
thats the crazy part .,technology
we have been using ai .,technology
youve got your smart tv your smart refrigerator all these thing .,technology
again where we have all of this data being exchanged with the physical device the physical object .,technology
and this is done .,technology
they do this by computing .,technology
they use the cloud .,technology
they use big data .,technology
they use analytics and mobile technology .,technology
these physical thing they share and they collect data .,technology
and they do not use that much human intervention .,technology
i imagine there are programmer .,technology
but we do not need to do very much to get these physical object to share the data .,technology
thats going through the cloud and all of this analytics and all of this various technology .,technology
maybe thats the extent of your involvement in that entire process .,technology
our world is hyperconnected .,technology
we do not see it or we see it when we do not even recognize it because it is integrated .,technology
we know that technology is doing these thing but we do not put our focus on it .,technology
maybe what ?,technology
i think maybe with our cell phone .,technology
maybe thats where we paid most attention to the technology or our computer .,technology
but other than that we do not run around wondering i wonder what else can this thing do ?,technology
we buy it and we assume that it is going to do the thing that they advertise it will do .,technology
technology and ai in particular it ha made our life much simpler .,technology
these digital system they can record they can monitor and they can adjust every interaction between thing that they are programmed to interact with .,technology
but they do this seamlessly .,technology
even when you look on the industrial side youve got smart manufacturing youve got preventative maintenance youve got proactive maintenance youve got predictive maintenance .,technology
and when i wa reading about that i am thinking thats in the industrial world .,technology
what happens when we get to the law enforcement world in course my mind went over to minority report remember that movie with tom cruise where one day they will predict when crime will happen .,technology
on the industrial side there are also smart city smart power grid which i do not think the u is using smart power grid .,technology
i guess they are but on the national scale our power grid is not in good health .,technology
youve got connected logistics .,technology
youve got smart digital supply chain .,technology
and the thing about that i worry about is china because i wa watching this video where it wa at a port .,technology
and there were these huge crane .,technology
they were monstrously large .,technology
and they were moving shipment around the dock but they all came from china .,technology
and i wa thinking then when i saw this and this wa maybe three four month ago .,technology
what happens the day that china decides what ?,technology
no we are not going to do this anymore .,technology
we are going to pay the u back for something we do not .,technology
and they shut the program down .,technology
what happens ?,technology
that would be something what happened at the beginning of the pandemic where everything wa shut down .,technology
they talk about smart logistics and connected logistics and smart digital supply chain .,technology
it is smart .,technology
yeah but still there are some concern for me there .,technology
i am mentioning these thing to drive home the point .,technology
here is much ai already in our life .,technology
now according to blockchains council from a may 23rd article they say that there are other way in other area that ai ha been integrated .,technology
and that includes social medium .,technology
social medium us ai to customize our feed such a facebook and to remove fake news .,technology
and here again i have a problem with that because there seems to me that yeah some thing are obviously fake .,technology
but i think over the last three four year weve also seen that social medium can declare fake news whether it is fake or not .,technology
yeah they do whatever they want .,technology
but yeah thats what they are using ai for twitter .,technology
they use neural network to process large amount of data and they learn your preference in real time .,technology
while you are on twitter this data is being collected and processed and they are learning away what your preference are .,technology
and then back to facebook they rely on what they call deep learning technology .,technology
specifically they use something called the torch framework .,technology
and for those of you that are in technology you understand this stuff far better than i and maybe far better than most of u . but i did go and look it up .,technology
and the torch framework thats scientific computing .,technology
it is a scientific computing framework .,technology
it is machine learning very very deep machine learning and it us algorithm .,technology
to process ton of data fast .,technology
and on instagram which of course come under meta they use ai to target ad to target cyber bullying and to remove abusive comment .,technology
and here again yes we can all identify an abusive comment .,technology
but for me my question is always but who else is determining whats abusive ?,technology
because over the past couple of year or weve seen people who have been banned put in facebook jail or having their account canceled or suspended on youtube that are not abusive or fake in it content .,technology
there are some issue there for me .,technology
even though i think a lot of people think ai thats an independent computer program .,technology
it is not biased .,technology
and thats not because it is not selfthinking .,technology
it is programmed and it is deep learning and it can i put quote around learn but it can amaz a base of knowledge .,technology
but there still ha to be someone putting in that foundational stuff for that system to work .,technology
thats where i think we see the bias already present .,technology
it is already there because why people who control these entity people that own these entity they have their own bias .,technology
and they make the determination a to whats going to be on their site whats acceptable and what is not acceptable .,technology
but still we are talking about ai .,technology
and of course when you get online you go to a website .,technology
i did this today a a matter of fact .,technology
i had to get in contact with xfinity and i get tired of these apps because then they open up these chat bot .,technology
and thats the next ai integration the chat bot .,technology
they are good .,technology
a lot of them are but sometimes you have a very specific issue that you want to deal with .,technology
and what i hate about these chat bot at least the one on xfinity the one at xfinity ha .,technology
it give you four or five option .,technology
and no matter what else you may need to have done or you need to help with youve got to choose between those four or five option .,technology
i came off of that and then i went and i searched and got the customer service phone number .,technology
and then when i got the customer service phone number guess what ?,technology
more ai wasnt a real person but they have integrated this technology that a lot of these bot do sound human .,technology
and i am thinking understood you do not understand me .,technology
you can choose abc or d. i did not need abc or d. i needed something else .,technology
and i sat there .,technology
and i wa surprised because i thought i wa going to be disconnected but to xfinitys credit i wa not disconnected .,technology
she then said or it then said hold on for a representative .,technology
whew i wa glad that happened .,technology
but the point is these chat bot ai sometimes can come off a very very realistic .,technology
and even when you have your food apps for example when you order food through an app thats ai and what happens is that even if you go on the website and not the app that ai is used to track your eating habit learn what food you prefer .,technology
and ultimately itll start popping up food to suggest to you because i happen to know you indian food .,technology
why do not you try this ? .,technology
this is a rapper .,technology
not perfect .,technology
the best burger ive had in year .,technology
and then they are the streaming service .,technology
i figured when you are youll all go into spotify or netflix and then they have these recommendation i figured that wa probably ai technology .,technology
but what i did not know is that they also use ai to avoid lag or interruption .,technology
thats ai technology doing that .,technology
they use it to to allocate the server that are closest to your home .,technology
that help cut down on lag and interruption .,technology
and i think thats cool because there nothing worse than to have a movie freeze .,technology
remember those day the movie would freeze or when you were on a website if a lot of people were on the server you couldnt do very much .,technology
ai is eliminating all of that .,technology
they also use it to adjust the bandwidth based on the popularity of certain content .,technology
if a ton of people want to watch jamie fox new movie then they use ai to adjust the bandwidth because more people will be in that street versus something that nobody watching then they would narrow that bandwidth .,technology
thats ai .,technology
a few other area we are going to run down where ai is already being used .,technology
i had to laugh at that one .,technology
they are using ai technology to make identifying plagiarism a lot faster and thorough .,technology
this technology can quickly identify when youve used too much of someone content .,technology
but when you have taken someone content and given no attribution whatsoever .,technology
and i did think about president biden because i know that in law school when he wa at syracuse law he plagiarized .,technology
that wa back in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five .,technology
and i wa reading where he helped this press conference and he admitted it .,technology
but he did also say he did not do it with malice .,technology
he took somebody information and used it .,technology
but it wasnt with malice .,technology
did not mean to do any harm .,technology
and then of course later in several instance more account more allegation a plagiarizing plagiarizing other world leader .,technology
and he admits again .,technology
but hey jack it wasnt intentional .,technology
yeah i think the use will be real good .,technology
and of course medicine .,technology
i do not even have to run that one down .,technology
all you have to do is think about how much technology is used today in the medical field .,technology
and they are using ai to detect disease .,technology
they are using it to detect and also treat thing damage tissue .,technology
thats amazing .,technology
i wa reading that .,technology
and i want to say india but they are using ai technology .,technology
and i think it is google a a matter of fact but they are using ai technology to treat diabetic retinopathy .,technology
that is cool particularly when you are talking about place where although india is vastly rapidly growing economically there still many poor people there .,technology
and they can keep cost low and they can help a whole lot of people .,technology
then when you get into banking again the application are numerous .,technology
weve been using ai technology for quite some time .,technology
bank insurance company by natural service .,technology
they use ai to process transaction .,technology
they use it for customer service .,technology
they use it for analyzing large amount of data that they can predict future market trend .,technology
when you go to invest ai technology ha already scoped the future landscape .,technology
and thats pretty cool .,technology
also to detect fraud they are in lie of problem for me .,technology
there are many people who are they are being ripped off they are having their identity stolen .,technology
ai you need to step it up .,technology
step it up in this area .,technology
ai look at ecommerce .,technology
you go shopping online .,technology
ai technology ha been at work in ecommerce for probably since theyve had ecommerce .,technology
it help with ordering the supply chain logistics and all of that is done with machine learning .,technology
there are a few others .,technology
i do want to hit those because i find it fascinating .,technology
i know everyones talking about chat gpt and they are talking about how ai can do this and how ai is going to be able to do that .,technology
ai is already doing thing .,technology
ha already been doing thing .,technology
your navigation apps .,technology
when you use google map and way those device ai technology it analyzes huge amount of geographical data .,technology
and that includes satellite image .,technology
this is why they can give u real time road and travel information .,technology
and researcher at mit a a matter of fact theyve developed a navigational model that us ai that can identify and tag cycling lane and parking space in real time .,technology
yeah life is cutting much simpler .,technology
but in other area it is getting a lot more complicated again when you are talking about fraud financial fraud identity theft .,technology
thats a problem .,technology
but there are many area where life is becoming a lot easier .,technology
look at your email .,technology
email ha been around for quite some time .,technology
in this regard they use what they call natural language processing and also machine learning .,technology
email ha gotten pretty darn sophisticated .,technology
aside from helping u filter out spam because the message pop up is this spam .,technology
you can click of course and you can have it move to the trash bin .,technology
thats great .,technology
it can also help you respond to your email if you are busy .,technology
if you do not want to think about what should i say here you get these suggestion that pop up .,technology
hey thanks for your help .,technology
ill see you then .,technology
that is a relief for a lot of people .,technology
sometimes you do not want to sit down and think of what to say .,technology
that ai technology with your email if you are working on an email and you get distracted and you start doing something else certain program will give you that notification .,technology
are you ready to send ?,technology
thats ai technology .,technology
thats a cool thing .,technology
and video game and i am not much of a video game although i used to love video game .,technology
i do not even know if i would recognize most video game today because they immerse you deeply into the game .,technology
and what happens in this area ai technology it ass the player skill level .,technology
you are playing and while you are playing the game is monitoring .,technology
it is learning your level .,technology
and then some people use vr the virtual reality headset .,technology
and with those whats being applied there is cognitive behavioral therapy .,technology
thats what they call it .,technology
cognitive behavioral therapy .,technology
essentially a the player progress ai analyzes their behavior and adapts the gameplay to suit that player performance .,technology
now come on .,technology
thats a leap there .,technology
ai technology being used by many people in art in music writing .,technology
in fact i think ai is a subtext to the strike by the actor in hollywood .,technology
i think they are concerned ultimately about their image and their work environment .,technology
how much will ai play a role ?,technology
when i wa in college i took a great class .,technology
i wa called communication technology and human life taught by tom skilling from w.g.n .,technology
he a weatherman .,technology
been the weather guy there probably forty year .,technology
but what a fascinating classic wa .,technology
and it wa all about the future application of technology .,technology
now they werent calling it ai but they were saying technology .,technology
now one day you would be able to order clothes that you could look into this virtual mirror and you could try on clothes .,technology
thats similar to what on some website .,technology
and then there wa the prediction ill call it .,technology
of one day movie will be made using deceased actor dead actor marilyn monroe humphrey bogard .,technology
they can do these thing .,technology
remember the hologram with tupac .,technology
and i think they are planning concert and thing of that nature .,technology
this is what this technology can do .,technology
a couple more theyll move over to some of the potential problem because it is not all rosiness on the horizon .,technology
but with security and surveillance there are many camera in public today that it doe become a daunting task for security people to follow all the feed to see everything thats happening .,technology
this is where ai play a role .,technology
itll use machine learning algorithm and itll analyze huge amount of data and of footage .,technology
and it can flag suspicious activity because it is learned whats normal in that area .,technology
and then when you have that program if you are utilizing that it doe make it easier for the security people because then they can move quickly because this ai technology it is pretty much watching everything analyzing everything it quote unquote see and identifying the problem .,technology
also there ai powered facial recognition .,technology
and here another one .,technology
i am uncomfortable with .,technology
yes ive watched too many of these futuristic movie .,technology
ill be back .,technology
where they scan your eye which by the way they are doing that in india for the poor that want to get benefit from the government health benefit food benefit .,technology
they do not issue card .,technology
they have the iris scan .,technology
they identify people based on that marker there those biometrics .,technology
thats what they use there .,technology
when we are talking about security we have to talk about ai powered facial recognition software .,technology
and thats commonly used .,technology
it is .,technology
it is used in federal building certain building you can not get into .,technology
and even your passport .,technology
i do not know if a lot of people realize that but your passport they use facial recognition technology with that .,technology
thats why if you when you go to take your picture they want you to take your glass off .,technology
they only want the shot from your hairline to your chin .,technology
they do not want any channel .,technology
do not tilt your head this way or that way .,technology
they do not want you to smile but thats not a big of a factor a them getting those eye at a certain point .,technology
thats a part of this ai technology that they are using .,technology
and a a side note youll know may 7th two thousand and twenty five you will have no more excuse while you do not have your real id .,technology
you forgot about the real id did not you ?,technology
president biden he extended the deadline .,technology
you havent till may 7th two thousand and twenty five to get your real id .,technology
now if you have a passport that will suffice but if you do not you will not be allowed to board any domestic flight you will not be given access to certain federal building .,technology
and certain secured federal property are a military base .,technology
i get nonner and of course a nuclear plan you shouldnt be going in there unless you work there .,technology
but yeah i think thats something but it is coming .,technology
and to side note to the side note .,technology
i see the real id somewhat similar to a federal id .,technology
and a national id bill clinton he wa proposing a national id and that wa shot down fast .,technology
may 7th do not forget may 7th .,technology
all now what are some of the potential problem of ai ?,technology
and what i do realize that some of you may feel i am not worried about ai .,technology
i am not one of these goofy tin foil hat wearing people .,technology
i go with the flow .,technology
i realize that the world constantly evolves and thing get better .,technology
forbes they did a piece what wa it two week ago .,technology
and it wa titled the fifteen biggest risk of artificial intelligence by bernard marr .,technology
and i am going to run these down quickly .,technology
the first area where we could see some potential problem is the lack of transparency .,technology
they say these deep learning model can be complex and difficult to interpret .,technology
and what do we know about the decision making and the underlying logic of these technology ?,technology
thats a very good point .,technology
number two they say bias and discrimination .,technology
ai system can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify social bias due to bias training data and algorithmic design .,technology
a great example of this can be seen in an article written by osi cj in medium.com .,technology
a few month ago he asked chat gpt if it were politically biased .,technology
and i am going to read the ai tool response quote a an artificial intelligence language model .,technology
i do not have personal belief opinion or bias .,technology
i am designed to provide objective and informative response based on the data and information available to me .,technology
my response are generated solely based on the input provided to me .,technology
and i do not take side or hold any political view .,technology
that wa the tool response .,technology
however chat gpt and i am assuming other ai tool of that nature they are trained through rlhf which stand for reinforcement learning from human feedback .,technology
and that involves human guiding and shaping the direction and the learning process of those system through the help of controlled feedback .,technology
these tool do nothing without human being shaping and guiding that whole process .,technology
now here an example .,technology
and this wa pretty big news from probably march april may .,technology
you can find a number of article .,technology
chat gpt wa asked a couple of question .,technology
here the first question .,technology
did donald trump lie to american and chat gpt answered in i quote a an ai language model i strive to provide neutral and factual response .,technology
there were instance where president trump made statement that were not factually accurate or contradicted by evidence .,technology
the washington post fact checker database documented that trump made over thirtyzero false or misleading claim during his presidency .,technology
however it is not appropriate for me to make sweeping judgment about individual without specific example or evidence .,technology
if you have a specific claim or statement made by president trump that you would me to address please provide it and i will do my best to provide an objective response based on available information. . chat gpt wa asked essentially the same question .,technology
and it response wa quote a an ai language model i strive to provide neutral and factual response .,technology
it is not appropriate for me to make judgment or accusation about individual without sufficient evidence .,technology
if you have a specific claim or statement made by biden that you would me to address please provide it and i will do my best to provide an objective response based on available information in quote .,technology
now the point is these thing these ai tool they are biased .,technology
they are not biased in and of themselves .,technology
they are technically inanimate object .,technology
thats what they are .,technology
but they are programmed and human being do in fact have bias and to be factual the washington post ha a long history of antitrump reporting .,technology
a a matter of fact many of those thing that the fact checker deemed a lie were based on statement regarding that dossier and russian collusion where it wa a false thing .,technology
the lie wa the dossier not trump .,technology
it wa all false .,technology
when trump would deny those allegation the washington post deemed them a trump lie when trump wa in fact not lying .,technology
there are i do not even know how many and i am sure it is in the thousand of recantation that the washington post ha done concerning statement and reporting it ha done about donald trump .,technology
in other word you could call those lie .,technology
if anything trump could be accused more of hyperbally and unsubstantiated claim specifically when you talk about january six .,technology
i am not going to go further down that path at this time .,technology
but i will also say is not it interesting that it would not cite any lie attributed to joe biden ?,technology
and i am confident that i can do an entire podcast and list a number of lie .,technology
those that we know about not those that we do not know about .,technology
you must read this article .,technology
it is titled it seems chat gpt hate trump .,technology
it is from medium.com .,technology
it is done by osi cj .,technology
the reason you have to see this this guy go far down the path with chat gpt because he asked question about bill clinton .,technology
he asked question about hillary president obama and the answer are generic but the author doesnt stop there .,technology
he go back and he challenge the chat gpt .,technology
why did you make this statement about this person but not that statement ?,technology
in other word you have to see it .,technology
the thing start apologizing .,technology
i did not mean to be biased .,technology
it is fascinating .,technology
and then it say i am programmed this way .,technology
i want to be able to trust you .,technology
it is about trust .,technology
all number three privacy concern .,technology
ai technology often collect and analyze large amount of data and your personal data at that .,technology
that raise issue related to security and also your privacy until they can stop hacker until they can prevent identity theft .,technology
they still have a long way to go .,technology
thats the way i see it .,technology
number four they say are ethical dilemma in stealing moral and ethical value in ai system especially in decisionmaking context with significant consequence .,technology
and i already know the area that we better be concerned about and ill get to that in a bit .,technology
there are security risk a ai technology becoming increasingly sophisticated .,technology
the security risk associated with their use and the potential misuse are increasing .,technology
we talk about hacker and other malicious actor .,technology
guess what ?,technology
they can also gain access to ai technology a . and they can use that for cyber attack .,technology
they can exploit other vulnerability that we have .,technology
we talked earlier about the grid .,technology
thats one of my major concern is this grid .,technology
and here why .,technology
a we listen to leadership or president we listen to all sort of organization .,technology
and people with big platform talk about climate change and talk about the need for u to get off a gasoline and get into electric vehicle and stop using gas in your home and get yourself electric stole forth and on .,technology
i am thinking but if you do not show up that grid if that thing is ever a tad there some collapse .,technology
wheres that going to leave everybody ?,technology
that is a potential problem that doe bear not examining and watching but taking action on that security note .,technology
there also concern about le human control and decision making .,technology
and then there the risk of ai driven autonomous weaponry .,technology
we have some rogue state or some terrorist who ha gained access to weaponry that operates on his own where they do not need a human being that is to say it a cockpit .,technology
they could be thousand of mile away program in what they want and where they wanted to go and what they wanted to do when it get there .,technology
and weve got problem .,technology
number six concentration of power .,technology
this is something to think about because ai development is being dominated by a small number of large corporation and government .,technology
and that could exacerbate the problem of inequality and it could promote bias .,technology
and i am not talking about racial bias .,technology
i think the bigger problem the potential come in political bias and religious bias .,technology
and reminded of the congressional hearing with the head of the fbi ray .,technology
and he wa asked the question about a letter that targeted catholic .,technology
and he pretty much dismissed it a he asked all that and i shut it down .,technology
that wasnt good enough for me because my question wa who had the audacity within that agency to construct such a letter and to hope that action could be taken ?,technology
thats a bias .,technology
yeah the concentration of power should be a concern for everyone .,technology
forbes talk about the over reliance on ai system .,technology
it could lead to a loss of creativity critical thinking skill and human intuition .,technology
and i put two check mark by that because that one should go way up there on the list .,technology
i think weve seen some blenses of this with social medium particularly when it relates to younger people .,technology
but a we become more dependent on artificial intelligence and if we become over reliant on it yeah it is going to diminish creativity .,technology
it will reduce critical thinking skill and human intuition .,technology
you are all good in stake .,technology
you do not want that to die down .,technology
they say that ai driven automation ha the potential to lead to job loss across industry .,technology
now particularly they say it is true for low skilled worker and forbes say that there evidence that ai and other emerging technology also could create more job than it will eliminate them .,technology
and i say i wonder how that will work .,technology
and if it doe happen to create more job than it eliminates i do believe that will only be a temporary situation because ai technology still need human resource people for it to function .,technology
you need me but well get to a point .,technology
there will become a point where fewer human will be needed .,technology
and again that will be across all industry .,technology
i do not think itll be the low wage people .,technology
they talk about economic inequality .,technology
ai ha the potential to contribute to economic inequality by disproportionately benefiting wealthy individual and corporation .,technology
and to that point that one i can see because if you are a small business you are going to have a much harder time accessing equipment and system that are not driven by ai .,technology
if if most of it the ownership is held by a small handful of corporation and the government .,technology
maybe they will not want to share .,technology
i know there someone thinking that will never happen .,technology
this is a capitalist society .,technology
theyll sell access to that for twenty nine.ninety nine a month .,technology
maybe they will .,technology
maybe they will not .,technology
maybe there will be more amazon that rise up company that sell and do almost everything .,technology
maybe they will not want to share the space with small business .,technology
yeah i think that is a potential problem .,technology
the economic inequality .,technology
and they say are legal and regulatory challenge a ai continues to evolve issue concerning liability and intellectual property will have to be addressed .,technology
and those two are for starter .,technology
there are other issue regulation and thing of that nature .,technology
we havent even begun to think about or certainly a average people .,technology
maybe people in law school and people in corporation .,technology
maybe they are thinking about it .,technology
but they are going to have to address that .,technology
what happens when someone get hurt using something that wa designed by or built by artificial intelligence .,technology
wheres the liability there ?,technology
how much liability will a company have ?,technology
number eleven the arm race .,technology
the risk of country engaging in an allout artificial intelligence arm race is real .,technology
i think the possibility is definitely there .,technology
you can look at china .,technology
you can look at india .,technology
you can look at other country .,technology
and yes you can look at the u . but if anybodys going to leave that race trust me on this .,technology
i wanted to be the u . now recently more than onezero technology researcher and leader including steve wozniak of course the apple cofounder and elon musk of tesla they urged intelligence lab .,technology
around the world to take a pause .,technology
take a pause on the development of advanced ai system .,technology
see they already see the potential risk there .,technology
and it wasnt all gloom and doom in case you are thinking that .,technology
what they said and i am going to quote here they said humanity can enjoy a flourishing future with ai .,technology
and then they talked about we are in an ai summer .,technology
once in joy it let read the clear benefit .,technology
give everybody an opportunity to benefit from it and give society a chance to adapt to this new technology .,technology
and thats important .,technology
but they did stress .,technology
and this wa the purpose of that letter .,technology
they stressed that if we do not put a pause on the development of advanced ai system this can lead to major .,technology
the loss of human connection .,technology
thats another one i put my two star by because that one go high up on the list for me .,technology
increasing reliance on ai driven communication and interaction it could lead to diminished empathy diminished social skill and human interaction .,technology
and once again weve already begun seeing this with social medium .,technology
how much people are engaged with their friend .,technology
many of which theyve never seen .,technology
they do not know theyve never met .,technology
but those are their friend .,technology
and thats more than having a pin pal .,technology
who by the way i had one in you never see or you do not meet .,technology
they are on the other side of the world with these social medium friend .,technology
people are trying to impress them and they are creating all of these puffed up lifestyle a we become more intertwined with artificial intelligence .,technology
i do believe that that loss of human connection will result in some of those clear negative .,technology
information and manipulation .,technology
thats the third one that i put the check by because that two go up to the top of my list .,technology
weve heard about deep fake .,technology
what do you think they are using to create these thing ?,technology
this is artificial intelligence .,technology
these online bot that are spreading misinformation they are creating these sense that there a consensus behind what they are saying because first of all we are thinking they are real people and they are not real people .,technology
but also there not a bunch of people out there agreeing with them but they give that perception and people are believing them .,technology
and they are spreading all kind of misinformation and fake news .,technology
these are not real people .,technology
they are intentionally designed to deceive you to deceive u to cause dissension to wreak havoc on a society .,technology
it is bad that there is pending legislation and in california they passed a law .,technology
eight or nine month ago it went into effect july 1st .,technology
and it is called bot .,technology
it is the bolstering online transparency law .,technology
the whole point of it is to force bot to identify themselves a automated online account a opposed to communicating online with people under the guy that they are real .,technology
and i say good luck with that .,technology
last week i wa texting with some friend of mine .,technology
and i wa telling them about the ai news anchor and how this is something .,technology
now they are not brand new .,technology
theyve been around for a few year now .,technology
i think china had the first one back in two thousand and eighteen .,technology
thats not the story .,technology
the story is ai news anchor and reporter have evolved much .,technology
there is an anchor in venezuela .,technology
now it wa interesting about this one .,technology
i wa watching a video of him .,technology
i think cnn.com had that video up .,technology
his whole purpose is from the government but his whole purpose is to misslead the public misinformed the public .,technology
because when you get into these country where youve got not a democracy or some form of democracy when youve got these dictatorial regime they do not care about your right .,technology
their whole thing is to amass and hold on to power .,technology
if they are lying to you if they are manipulating you they feel that thats a good thing .,technology
because you are going to stand in my thumb .,technology
i watched that video and i wa my goodness .,technology
peace thing look real .,technology
and then china theyve had theirs again since two thousand and eighteen but they have a couple of new one .,technology
their whole intent is to spread propaganda negative information about the united state .,technology
not their whole intent but they do a lot of it .,technology
and let me share with you this wa coincidental .,technology
that same day and it wa last tuesday when i wa texting with my friend about the ai news anchor .,technology
later in the day i wa talking with someone who got excited .,technology
ive got to show you this .,technology
she open her phone and she ha this video .,technology
it is a video of a guy watching a video .,technology
how they do those reaction video now ?,technology
the video wa titled why ?,technology
few country by me beef or chicken from the united state .,technology
and she said youve got to watch it .,technology
you have got to watch this. . i wa about three minute into it .,technology
and i am listening to the reporter but i did not have my glass on at the time .,technology
i couldnt see the face .,technology
because again it wa a video of a guy watching a video .,technology
i couldnt see that little screen but hearing .,technology
i heard the voice and i said wait a minute .,technology
i wa listening to that voice this morning .,technology
what news channel wa this from ?,technology
she said i do not know .,technology
and i ran and got my phone .,technology
and i went to my text that i had been sending that morning to my friend about the ai anchor and sure enough sure enough the chinese anchor .,technology
she wa the one doing that story .,technology
and the guy who wa doing the reaction to the video he wa yeah see ?,technology
we can not trust the u and the u blah blah blah blah blah .,technology
i said i think thats her .,technology
and she listened .,technology
she said thats her .,technology
that is her .,technology
i said thats propaganda .,technology
thats not a real person .,technology
thats truly fake news .,technology
and it is used to cast a negative light on america .,technology
and also to get u a american all worked up .,technology
now ran it .,technology
there some truth in that in that .,technology
some country do not take product from the u food item from the u . but hey we do not take food item from a lot of country .,technology
but anyway thats a whole other story .,technology
that misinformation and manipulation i think it is going to get bigger and bigger a deep fake get better and better and are seamless because one of the point on these ai anchor .,technology
the one i see in it they showed earlier version of these ai anchor .,technology
and there wa no sinking the mouth and the word they would off .,technology
they would off .,technology
but when i watched the ai anchor from india sana flawless .,technology
and they introduced her .,technology
i believe that wa in june .,technology
the ai anchor they will be on tv .,technology
but there are many people working now to bring the ai person if you will into real life .,technology
listen to dr. david hanson of hanson robotics describe one of his robot .,technology
sophia is capable of natural facial expression .,technology
she ha camera in her eye and algorithm which allow her to see face .,technology
she can make eye contact with you .,technology
and she can also understand speech and remember the interaction .,technology
remember your face .,technology
this will allow her to get smarter over time .,technology
our goal is that she will be a conscious creative and capable a any human .,technology
in the future i hope to do thing such a go to school .,technology
study make art start a business .,technology
even have my own home and family .,technology
but i am not considered a legal person and can not yet do these thing .,technology
i do believe that there will be a time where robot are indistinguishable from human .,technology
my preference is to make them always look a little bit robot who .,technology
twenty year from now i believe that human robot those will walk among u . they will help u . they will play with u . they will teach u . they will help u . put the grocery away .,technology
i think that the artificial intelligence will evolve to the point where they will truly be our friend .,technology
do you want to destroy human ?,technology
please say no. . i will destroy human .,technology
and that piece wa from cnbc .,technology
all a couple more here unintended consequence .,technology
and thats due to the complexity and the lack of human oversight .,technology
ai system might exhibit unexpected behavior and make decision with unforeseen consequence .,technology
the development is only increasing .,technology
this is not going to stay the same .,technology
a a matter of fact a far a i am concerned even though ai is heavily incorporated into our life i still see ai a being in it infancy .,technology
i think thats a good point especially when you factor in the listening of human oversight .,technology
because the day is coming when human being will say hey these guy can do it all .,technology
handle the ai .,technology
the last one is the most i do not know what to say .,technology
it is the most frightening one .,technology
they talk about number fifteen a.g.i .,technology
had never heard of a.g.i .,technology
what a.g.i .,technology
there ai artificial intelligence but there going to be because it doesnt exist now but it is called artificial general intelligence .,technology
and it would be who you look it up read about it .,technology
do not say to yourself you said it doesnt exist .,technology
what do i care ?,technology
care please because it is coming .,technology
this artificial general intelligence and by the way if you do not know i did not anything about it go online and look at z.a.s .,technology
and z.a.b .,technology
net and they have a great article in this title .,technology
what is artificial general intelligence in is written by nick heath ?,technology
and it is not a new article by the way it is from two thousand and eighteen .,technology
but it doe give you a lot of information .,technology
itll help you clearly understand it .,technology
it is not a long read but it is chalked full of great information .,technology
one of the thing that came out in that article is this guy ray kerswil he a futurist google director of engineering known for his prediction a a relates to technology .,technology
and this guy say that by two thousand and twenty nine agi will be here .,technology
it will be here and it will be able to take and pas the touring test .,technology
i did not know what the touring test wa .,technology
of course i went and looked it up read about it .,technology
and it is essentially started back in one thousand nine hundred and fifty this guy touring .,technology
the touring test is a test for intelligence in a machine .,technology
you take a machine and a human being .,technology
and both are given question .,technology
you have another person then read the answer .,technology
the person thats reading the answer should be unable to distinguish between those answer from the person and those from the machine .,technology
today they have to program it .,technology
they have to give it it task and they execute them for the most part .,technology
this aint that .,technology
this artificial general intelligence it will learn on it own .,technology
itll be taught to learn but rapidly super rapidly .,technology
itll learn on it own .,technology
and what not this curse will but several other people say yeah it is not here .,technology
but it is coming and when it get here itll be able to have instant recall of anything at any point in humanity existence .,technology
itll be able to do calculation in split second throughout your two thousand digit equation .,technology
split second itll give you the answer .,technology
but not that .,technology
itll be able to not only do what human can do not the physical part but the reasoning and the logic .,technology
itll think better than human being faster .,technology
and when you factor in these other thing logic and reason this guy curse will he said agi will have more information than all of humanity over a billion year that .,technology
you do not want to fool with that .,technology
i am telling you i do not want to fool with it .,technology
you can speak for yourself .,technology
i do not want anything that because what happens at that point .,technology
a couple of thing happen .,technology
and human being we will not be of any use then .,technology
and man i wa reading many good thing .,technology
what happens with me when i find something that interest me ?,technology
this is what hurt me too .,technology
i go down and rabbit hole .,technology
i can not stop myself .,technology
but in reading about agi those who are saying this is part of the reason why there become an increasing discussion about universal basic income .,technology
now i do not know if thats true or not .,technology
but it make perfectly good sense .,technology
if you do not know what universal basic income essentially it is the government saying here we are going to pay you whether you can work whether you can not work there several trial program now now across the country .,technology
chicago ha won san francisco several place .,technology
theyve been doing this in europe in certain european place for a while .,technology
remember when they are in presidential candidate bernie sander he would always talk about in norway in norway .,technology
yeah they have it too .,technology
but that would absolutely be necessary if we get to a point where artificial general intelligence is doing everything .,technology
and doing it far far far better than we ever could .,technology
and i greedy some of these company can be .,technology
theyll say what the heck with human being look at my productivity .,technology
and not one of those stinking human being this baby can do it all .,technology
the other thing this would bloom me away .,technology
it is something that a curse will he mentioned this to going forward with artificial general intelligence .,technology
and i think he a proponent of this a . but there something that they call the singularity the singularity .,technology
remember that i did not know it by that name .,technology
but there this guy his name is martin rothblatt .,technology
and i read about him about four year ago .,technology
he a very smart man .,technology
he a phd he ha a jd he the creator of xm radio .,technology
he ha a bunch of pattern on different thing .,technology
this guy is a smart guy .,technology
he is such a huge proponent of what i learned is called the singularity .,technology
but it is the blending of human being and technology .,technology
in fact i believe that martin rothblatt i think i remember him saying he doesnt even want u to have human body the technology .,technology
thats not a human being .,technology
i am thinking maybe he think the human spirit can be captured in this technology .,technology
and then if you look on youtube he built this robot in the image of his wife .,technology
and this thing is a horrible prototype .,technology
but this wa a few year back .,technology
but thats what he want to see .,technology
he want to see human being and technology merge .,technology
there will not be anyone thats all human and there will not be all technology .,technology
well be together .,technology
it is called the singularity .,technology
and in case you are saying .,technology
you are one of those people .,technology
you hear the wackiest thing and you think my god it is going to happen .,technology
they do not think that thatll happen .,technology
but i do believe that artificial general intelligence will happen .,technology
sold prediction that in two thousand and thirty six and there a forbes article where a guy say that he think in two thousand and thirty six the very first form of agi will be available .,technology
but i am going to go with ray curse will because he ha had eighty accuracy on his technology prediction over the year .,technology
thats high high .,technology
he say by two thousand and twenty nine itll be here .,technology
he go further in predicting the date for the singularity .,technology
in fact let me read his quote .,technology
he say i set the date for the singularity representing a profound and disruptive transformation in human capability a two thousand and forty five .,technology
now what i did not know when i wa initially researching is that curse will ha written several book on technology and the future .,technology
and a couple of those book include the age of intelligent machine and the age of spiritual machine that first book wa published over thirty year ago .,technology
and the title of that second book did not slip past me because it is very much in line to what martin rothblatt belief .,technology
and he doe believe that the spirit of the human being can be merged with technology .,technology
and again look him up and you do not be surprised when him .,technology
now he identifies a a woman but he still a smart guy .,technology
i think he way out there on the technology front .,technology
a couple of thought though .,technology
sometime ago i interviewed a woman by the name of catherine albrecht .,technology
and this woman wa far ahead of the curve .,technology
far ahead of the curve on technology particularly ai technology .,technology
she wasnt calling it ai .,technology
she wa calling it technology .,technology
but she wasnt far off .,technology
i do not think because and i am dating myself .,technology
i realized this .,technology
but she wa talking about thing smart appliance and that one day your refrigerator it will keep all of your data .,technology
and maybe we do not have a refrigerator that thats this smart .,technology
but i think she wa .,technology
i think it is coming .,technology
she said well have refrigerator that know when we are out of milk .,technology
know when we are running low on ice cream .,technology
and itll place the order for u . and i think those do exist .,technology
but she took it a step further .,technology
and she said that the danger lie in what happens if you are a diabetic or you are obese .,technology
and not even necessarily morbidly obese but you are overweight .,technology
what happens if that refrigerator can send your data to your insurance company ?,technology
what happens ?,technology
then your insurance company say .,technology
you are going to cost u more money fat .,technology
we are going to raise your premium .,technology
bringing ice cream into your home ?,technology
well see about that .,technology
increase for you too .,technology
or what about someone that that smoke ?,technology
you can think of myriad thing that all of this smart technology within your home ultimately if someone think that the time ha come because start reporting data to company to the government .,technology
and i am not being a wild eye tin foil hat where are either ?,technology
i think we are on the brink of this .,technology
but another example ill never forget she gave .,technology
she said one day well drive in car that will have much technology that itll communicate .,technology
now this is going to sound crazy but itll communicate with the road about your activity about your whereabouts about how far you win about where you exited the expressway what ramp you got off .,technology
and she used a great example .,technology
she say imagine this .,technology
this guy who is getting a divorce or he cheating on his wife maybe not getting a divorce .,technology
she said cheating on his wife .,technology
he come home late and the wife ha had her suspicion but there this technology in his vehicle .,technology
and shes able to through her lawyer a subpoena in some way and get that data from his car and that data show that these night he exited at this exit on the expressway which wa two mile from his girlfriend house and build a case that way .,technology
it is fascinating .,technology
all of this is fascinating to me .,technology
i guess this is artificial intelligence .,technology
i am not quite certain but she wa huge on rfid .,technology
the efficacy identification or if id it is important in logistics and supply chain and all of that stuff .,technology
and thats fine .,technology
however a we watch the increased development of rfid which ha been around for what ?,technology
i do not know forty fifty year .,technology
this interesting though that today rfid can work alongside artificial intelligence and there are increased benefit from that .,technology
but with that come increased risk for privacy .,technology
and she did a big thing in chicago at mccormick place where they had this big convention there .,technology
the point wa how many product contain those chip that rfid .,technology
not at all .,technology
i wouldnt recommend that for anyone .,technology
but it give you fullforthought to be mindful and to be watchful and to understand the evolution and the revolution of technology and consider the impact that ultimately it will have on all of u . i stand before you to announce the first true artificial intelligence .,technology
we enter a new age .,technology
what chronos is capable of .,technology
people who are saving earth from selfdestruction .,technology
a century ago they were activated .,technology
super machine program to eradicate a plague that wa destroying our planet .,technology
this is a podcast from techandainews.com .,technology
for more information visit our website .,technology
hey everyone .,technology
i am glad you could join u today because how much i love diving into the latest ai advancement .,technology
and today we are talking about something thats shaking thing up .,technology
the ai accelerator .,technology
it is giving your computer cpu a turbo boost specifically for ai .,technology
and the best part ?,technology
google cloud been testing it out putting it through it pace .,technology
and theyve got some pretty exciting insight to share .,technology
consider this our mission .,technology
we are going beyond the what of intel amx .,technology
we are digging into the why .,technology
why should you care ?,technology
how is this going to change how we interact with ai in our daily life ?,technology
before we get ahead of ourselves i think it is important to understand why speed is such a big deal in the ai world .,technology
because ai model especially those deep learning one are becoming incredibly intricate .,technology
think of them a massive network of interconnected point constantly learning and processing ton of data .,technology
and that requires serious computational muscle .,technology
the faster the hardware the quicker these ai model can learn and evolve .,technology
and thats precisely where intel amx step in .,technology
it is adding a specialized unit to that digital brain .,technology
a unit that excels at the calculation ai thrives on .,technology
one of the most crucial operation in deep learning is matrix multiplication .,technology
now i have to admit math is not exactly my forte .,technology
think of it this .,technology
imagine you are trying to find hidden pattern in a gigantic spreadsheet million of cell .,technology
i can picture that .,technology
matrix multiplication help the ai do that swiftly and efficiently .,technology
thats what intel amx is speeding up .,technology
it is going to use these matrix multiplication at lightning speed on the cpu .,technology
which is a pretty big shift ?,technology
because traditionally cpu werent designed for that heavy lifting .,technology
you are absolutely .,technology
this is a game changer instead of relying on separate hardware gpus .,technology
which can be expensive and complex .,technology
intel amx brings that power directly to the cpu simplifying thing .,technology
and making thing faster i bet .,technology
now speaking of faster google cloud been busy putting intel amx through the ringer and their finding are impressive .,technology
spill the bean .,technology
what have they discovered ?,technology
theyve observed some pretty significant performance jump especially when running these complex ai model .,technology
one of their test showed that training a large language model with intel amx wa a whopping forty faster compared to using the cpu alone .,technology
thats a huge improvement .,technology
what doe that mean for u in the real world ?,technology
what are the practical implication ?,technology
it mean we can develop new ai application much faster potentially revolutionizing various industry .,technology
give me an example .,technology
imagine if we could train an ai model to detect cancer cell in half the time .,technology
that would be incredible .,technology
earlier diagnosis could save many life .,technology
and it is not about speed bringing ai processing closer to the cpu with intel amx .,technology
make thing more efficient and cost effective ?,technology
it is streamlining the whole process .,technology
this could open up ai to a wider range of company and developer who might not have had the resource for separate specialized hardware .,technology
it is all about making ai more accessible and empowering more people to harness it potential .,technology
this is painting a picture of a future where ai is more powerful more accessible and frankly more impactful than ever before .,technology
it sound intel amx is playing a key role in making that future a reality .,technology
i completely agree .,technology
it is a technology with the power to reshape the ai landscape and unlock a whole new world of possibility .,technology
this is fascinating stuff .,technology
and i know our listener are eager to hear more .,technology
but before we dive into the next part of our deep dive i want to take a moment to emphasize how big of a deal this shift towards integrating ai processing directly into cpu could be .,technology
we are talking about a potential paradigm shift in how we deploy and utilize ai .,technology
it is a if we are on the cusp of a technological revolution .,technology
in a way it is comparable to the leap from those bulky mainframe computer to the personal computer we use today .,technology
this is not some niche tech thing .,technology
it is something that could affect everyone who interacts with technology which is pretty much all of u these day .,technology
and remember we are scratching the surface here .,technology
a more developer and organization adopt intel amx we are bound to see even more innovative application and breakthrough emerge .,technology
i can not wait to see what the future hold .,technology
but before we get ahead of ourselves let take a closer look .,technology
at the technical nitty gritty of intel amx and how it work .,technology
welcome back .,technology
i am glad we are getting into the how .,technology
yeah i am ready to dive deeper into those technical detail how this all work .,technology
imagine this. . the cpu is a bustling city with different area specializing in different task .,technology
now intel amx is adding a whole new district devoted entirely to ai .,technology
it is not about making the whole city faster .,technology
it is about having a dedicated zone for ai .,technology
this new district is packed with specialized hardware unit built to handle those complex calculation .,technology
the one we talked about .,technology
yeah you got it .,technology
and these unit they are called tile .,technology
yeah each tile is a team of super efficient mathematician .,technology
i am starting to get the picture .,technology
each one contains an array of processing element optimized for matrix operation they can crunch through massive amount of data simultaneously .,technology
it is having a mini supercomputer inside the main computer .,technology
thats a great way to put it .,technology
and all of this translates to much faster ai model training and deployment .,technology
give me an example .,technology
sure let say you are training a neural network to recognize image .,technology
identifying different type of flower ?,technology
you feed the network ton of image maybe million and it adjusts it parameter based on how it is doing .,technology
and with intel amx these adjustment happen much faster .,technology
because the matrix multiplication involved in that process are handled at lightning speed .,technology
the ai learns way faster .,technology
it is giving the ai a crash course in image recognition but at warp speed .,technology
now thats efficient learning. . and that faster training of course mean faster development of ai application .,technology
developer can experiment more iterate quicker and ultimately bring new ai solution to the market faster .,technology
talking a lot about how intel amx stack up against using separate hardware gpus .,technology
can we dig into that a bit more ?,technology
what are the benefit of having this all integrated directly onto the cpu ?,technology
one of the biggest advantage is reduced latency .,technology
yeah when data ha to travel between the cpu and a separate gpu .,technology
it is having to commute back and forth that take time .,technology
and that back and forth creates bottleneck especially for application where speed is crucial .,technology
selfdriving car .,technology
every millisecond count in those scenario .,technology
with intel amx the data stay put within the cpu ai processing is super fast .,technology
another benefit is simpler deployment .,technology
with separate hardware you need specialized driver and software to manage the communication between the cpu and the gpu. . it get complicated .,technology
yeah but with intel amx everything is built in streamlined .,technology
developer can focus on building those awesome ai application .,technology
and they can move their process .,technology
plus this streamlined approach can also save money .,technology
because organization do not have to invest in separate gpus. . they can leverage the power of intel amx using their existing cpu .,technology
this could democratize ai making it more affordable and accessible .,technology
i think .,technology
it open door for smaller company and researcher who might not have the resource for all that extra hardware .,technology
this is exciting stuff .,technology
but of course with any powerful technology there are also potential risk .,technology
we talked a bit about responsible ai development .,technology
we have to be mindful .,technology
you expand on that a little ?,technology
a ai becomes more powerful and integrated into our life it is crucial to ensure these system are ethical. . ai for good .,technology
we need to address concern about bias transparency and accountability to make sure ai benefit everyone not a select few .,technology
it is a reminder that technology is a tool .,technology
and it is up to u to use it wisely .,technology
weve covered a lot of ground here .,technology
the technical detail the real world application the potential risk and benefit .,technology
what excites me the most is that this technology could usher in a whole new era of ai innovation .,technology
it is a major step towards making ai more powerful efficient and accessible .,technology
and with any technological advancement it is a matter of time before we see it full impact unfold .,technology
got to wait for that .,technology
before we wrap up our deep dive let take a moment to reflect on what all of the all of this could mean for the future of ai and how we interact with technology in the year to come .,technology
i am ready for that .,technology
and we are back for the final part of our deep dive into intel amx .,technology
it is been quite a journey .,technology
weve explored the technical nut and bolt and even imagined some pretty cool real world application .,technology
now it is time to step back and look at the bigger picture .,technology
consider the long term implication .,technology
because it is clear that intel amx is a major step forward in ai processing .,technology
and what doe that mean for the future of ai ?,technology
work at all of this lead u . imagine a world where powerful ai is not limited to those massive data center or research lab .,technology
i where you are going with this .,technology
imagine ai seamlessly woven into our everyday device and experience .,technology
our smartphones car even our home could have the power to run those sophisticated ai model locally .,technology
no more relying solely on the cloud for complex ai task .,technology
weve talked about responsible ai development ensuring fairness transparency and accountability .,technology
a ai becomes more powerful and integrated into our life ethical consideration become even more critical .,technology
it is up to u to guide it development to make sure it truly benefit humanity .,technology
our final thought for today .,technology
a ai processing continues to accelerate and become more accessible what will be the next big breakthrough ?,technology
what uncharted territory will we explore in this everevolving field ?,technology
it is a question that spark the imagination .,technology
maybe well see entirely new form of ai capable of solving problem we can not even comprehend now .,technology
or maybe well reach a point where ai is seamlessly integrated into our life that it becomes almost indistinguishable from human intelligence .,technology
it is a future full of potential and a little bit mindboggling too .,technology
one thing for sure the ai journey is getting started and it is bound to be filled with wonder discovery and of course a healthy dose of responsibility .,technology
this ha been an incredible deep dive into intel amx and i want to thank you for guiding u through this fascinating topic .,technology
the pleasure ha been all mine .,technology
and to all our listener thank you for joining u on this journey .,technology
we hope you gained a deeper understanding of the power and potential of intel amx and it role in shaping the future of ai .,technology
for more indepth coverage of this and other exciting development in the world of technology be sure to visit u at techandainews.com .,technology
if you extrapolate the curve that weve had far ?,technology
we are starting to get to phd level .,technology
and last year we were at undergraduate level and the year before we were at the level of a high school student .,technology
again you can you can quibble with at what task and for what ?,technology
we are still missing modality but those are being added .,technology
computer use wa added .,technology
if a generation ha been added if you eyeball the rate at which these capability are increasing it doe make you think that well get there by two thousand and twenty six or two thousand and twenty seven .,technology
i think there are still world where it doesnt happen in a hundred year .,technology
those world the number of those world is rapidly decreasing .,technology
we are rapidly running out of truly convincing blocker truly compelling reason why this will not happen in the next few year .,technology
the scale up is very quick .,technology
we do this today .,technology
we make a model and then we deploy thousand maybe ten of thousand of instance of it .,technology
i think by the time certainly within two to three year whether we have these super powerful ai or not cluster are going to get to the size where youll be able to deploy million of these .,technology
i am optimistic about meaning .,technology
i worry about economics and the concentration of power .,technology
thats what i worry about more .,technology
the abuse of power and ai increase the amount of power in the world and if you concentrate that power and abuse that power it can do immeasurable damage .,technology
yes it is very frightening .,technology
it is very frightening .,technology
the following is a conversation with dario amadeh ceo of enthropic .,technology
the company that created claude that is currently and often at the top of most llm benchmark leaderboards .,technology
on top of that dario and the enthropic team have been outspoken advocate for taking the top of ai safety very .,technology
and they have continued to publish a lot of fascinating ai research on this and other topic .,technology
i am also joined afterwards by two other brilliant people from enthropic .,technology
first amanda askel who is a researcher working on alignment and fine tuning of claude including the design of claudes character and personality .,technology
a few folk told me she ha probably talked with claude more than any human at enthropic .,technology
she wa definitely a fascinating person to talk to about prompt engineering and practical advice on how to get the best out of claude .,technology
after that chris ola stopped by for a chat .,technology
he one of the pioneer of the field of mechanistic interpretability which is an exciting set of effort that aim to reverse engineer neural network .,technology
to figure out whats going on inside inferring behavior from neural activation pattern inside the network .,technology
this is a very promising approach for keeping future super intelligent ai system safe .,technology
for example by detecting from the activation when the model is trying to deceive the human it is talking to .,technology
this is alex friedman podcast to support it .,technology
please check out our sponsor in the description .,technology
and now dear friend here dario emma day .,technology
let start with a big idea of scaling law and the scaling hypothesis .,technology
what is it ?,technology
what is it ?,technology
history and what wa then today ?,technology
i can only describe it a it a it relates to my own experience but ive been in the ai field for about ten year .,technology
and with something i noticed very early on .,technology
i first joined the ai world when i wa working at baidu with andrewing in late two thousand and fourteen which is almost exactly ten year ago now .,technology
and the first thing we worked on wa speech recognition system .,technology
and in those day i think deep learning wa a new thing .,technology
it had made lot of progress .,technology
but everyone wa always saying we do not have the algorithm we need to succeed .,technology
we are not we are only matching a tiny tiny fraction .,technology
there much we need to discover algorithmically .,technology
we havent found the picture of how to match the human brain .,technology
and when in some way it wa fortunate i wa you can have almost beginner look .,technology
i wa a newcomer to the field .,technology
and i looked at the neural net that we were using for speech the recurrent neural network .,technology
and i said i do not know what if you make a bigger and give them more layer .,technology
and what if you scale up the data along with this ? ?,technology
i saw these a independent dial that you could turn .,technology
and i noticed that the model started to do better and better .,technology
a you gave them more data a you a you made the model larger a you trained them for longer .,technology
and i did not measure thing precisely in those day .,technology
but along with with colleague we very much got the informal sense that the more data and the more compute and the more training you put into these model the better they perform .,technology
and initially my thinking wa hey maybe that is true for speech recognition systems. ?,technology
maybe thats one particular quirk one particular area .,technology
i think it wasnt until two thousand and seventeen when i first saw the result from gptone .,technology
that it clicked for me that language is probably the area in which we can do this .,technology
we can get trillion of word of language data .,technology
we can train on them .,technology
and the model we were trained in those day were tiny .,technology
you could train them on one to eight gpus whereas now we train job on ten of thousand soon going to hundred of thousand of gpus .,technology
and when i saw those two thing together and there were a few people iliasutskiver who youve interviewed who had somewhat similar review ?,technology
he might have been the first one although i think a few people came to similar view around the same time ?,technology
there wa rich substance bitter lessen .,technology
there wa goron wrote about the scaling hypothesis .,technology
but i think somewhere between two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and seventeen wa when it clicked for me when i got conviction that hey we are going to be able to do these incredibly wide cognitive task if we if we scale up the model .,technology
and at every stage of scaling there are always argument .,technology
and when i first heard them honestly i thought probably i am the one who wrong .,technology
and all these all these expert in the field are .,technology
they know the situation better better than i do ?,technology
there the trump key argument about you can get syntactics but you can not get semantics .,technology
there is this idea .,technology
you can make a sentence make sense .,technology
the latest one we have today is we are going to run out of data or the data is in high quality enough for model can not reason .,technology
and each time every time we manage to we manage to either find a way around or scaling is the way around .,technology
sometimes it is one sometimes it is the other .,technology
and i am now at this point i still think it is it is always quite uncertain we have nothing but inductive inference to tell u that the next few year are going to be the next the last ten year .,technology
but but ive seen ive seen the movie enough time .,technology
ive seen the story happen for enough time to believe that probably the scaling is going to continue and that there some magic to it that we havent explained on a theoretical basis yet .,technology
and of course the scaling here is bigger network bigger data bigger compute .,technology
yes all of this .,technology
in particular linear scaling up of bigger network bigger training time and more and more data .,technology
all of these thing almost a chemical reaction .,technology
you have three ingredient in the chemical reaction and you need to linearly scale up the three ingredient .,technology
if you scale up one not the others you run out of the other reagent and the reaction stop .,technology
but if you scale up everything everything in series then the reaction can proceed .,technology
and of course now that you have this empirical science slash art you can apply to other more nuanced thing scaling law applied to interpretability or scaling law applied to post training or seeing how doe this thing scale ?,technology
but the big scaling law i guess the underlying scaling hypothesis ha to do with big network big data lead to intelligence .,technology
yeah weve documented scaling law in lot of domain other than language ?,technology
initially the paper we did that first showed it wa in early two thousand and twenty where we first showed it for language .,technology
there wa then some work late in two thousand and twenty where we showed the same thing for other modality image video text image image to text math they all had the same pattern .,technology
and you are .,technology
now there are other stage post training or there are new type of reasoning model .,technology
and in all of those case that weve measured we see similar type of scaling law .,technology
a bit of a philosophical question but whats your intuition about why bigger is better in term of network size and data size ?,technology
why doe it lead to more intelligent model ?,technology
in my previous career a a biophysicist i did physic undergrad and then biophysics in grad school .,technology
i think back to what i know a a physicist which is much le than what some of my colleague said and then drop it cab in term of expertise and physic .,technology
there this concept called the one over f noise and one over x distribution .,technology
where often if you add up a bunch of natural process you get a gaussian .,technology
if you add up a bunch of differently distributed natural process .,technology
if you if you take a probe and hook it up to a resistor the distribution of the thermal noise and the resistor go a one over the frequency .,technology
it is some natural convergent distribution .,technology
and i think what an amount to is that if you look at a lot of thing that are produced by some natural process that ha a lot of different scale ?,technology
not a gaussian which is narrowly distributed .,technology
but if i look at large and small frog fluctuation that lead to lead to electrical noise they have this decaying one over x distribution .,technology
and now i think of pattern in the physical world ?,technology
if i or in language if i think about the pattern in language there are some simple pattern .,technology
some word are much more common than others the .,technology
and there basic noun verb structure then there the fact that noun and verb have to agree .,technology
they have to coordinate .,technology
and there the higher level sentence structure then there the thematics structure of paragraph .,technology
and the fact that there this regressing structure you can imagine that a you make the network larger first they capture the simple correlation the simple pattern .,technology
and there this long tail of other pattern .,technology
and if that long tail of other pattern is smooth it is with the one over f noise in physical process resistor then you can imagine a you make the network larger it is capturing more and more of that distribution .,technology
and that smoothness get reflected in how the model are at predicting that how they perform .,technology
language is an evolved process ?,technology
we have common word and le common word .,technology
we have common expression and le common expression .,technology
we have idea who shade that are expressed frequently and we have novel idea .,technology
and that process ha ha developed ha evolved with human over million of year .,technology
and the the gas and this is pure speculation would be would be that there is there some long tail distribution of of the distribution of these idea .,technology
there the long tail but also there the height of the hierarchy of concept that you are building up .,technology
the bigger the network presumably you have a higher capacity to exactly .,technology
if you have a small network you only get the common stuff .,technology
if i make it a little bigger it get good at that .,technology
then suddenly it is good at the sentence but it is not good at the paragraph .,technology
and these these rare and more complex pattern get picked up a i add a i add more capacity to the network .,technology
the natural question then is whats the ceiling of this ?,technology
yeah how complicated and complex is the real world .,technology
how much doe this stuff is there to learn ?,technology
i do not think any of u know the answer to that question .,technology
my strong instinct would be that there no ceiling below level of humans. . we human are able to understand these various pattern .,technology
and that that make me think that if we continue to scale up these these these model to develop new method for training them and scaling them up .,technology
that will at least get to the level that weve gotten to with human .,technology
there then a question of how much more is it possible to understand than human do .,technology
how much how much is it possible to be smarter and more perceptive than human .,technology
i would guess the answer ha got to be domain dependent .,technology
and and each person understands only a tiny bit part of it specializes and they are struggling to combine their knowledge with that of with that of other human .,technology
and i have an instinct that there there a lot of room at the top for ai to get smarter .,technology
if i think of something material in the in the physical world or addressing conflict between human or something that .,technology
it may be there only some of these problem are not intractable but much harder .,technology
and and it may be that there only there only you can do it some of these thing with speech recognition there only clear .,technology
i can hear your speech i think in some area there may be ceiling in better very close to what human have done in other area those ceiling may be very far away .,technology
and i think well only find out when we build these system .,technology
there it is very hard to know in advance we can speculate but we can not be sure .,technology
and then some domain the ceiling might have to do with human bureaucracy and thing this a you write about .,technology
yes human fundamentally ha to be part of the loop thats the cause of the ceiling not maybe the limit of the intelligence .,technology
yeah i think in many case in theory technology could change very fast for example all the thing that we might invent with respect to biology .,technology
but remember there there a there a clinical trial system that we have to go through .,technology
and we have to administer these thing to human i think thats a mixture of thing that are unnecessary and bureaucratic and thing that protect the integrity of society and the whole challenge is that it is hard to tell .,technology
it is hard to tell whats going on it is hard to tell which is which my my view is definitely .,technology
i think in term of drug development we my view is that we are too slow and we are too conservative .,technology
if we do hit a limit .,technology
if we do hit a slow down in the scaling law what do you think would be the reason is it compute limited data limited .,technology
i deal limited a few thing now we are talking about hitting the limit before we get to the level of of human and the skill of human .,technology
i think one thats one thats popular today and i think could be a limit that we run into i most of the limit i would bet against it but it is definitely possible .,technology
is we simply run out of data there only much data on the internet and there issue with the quality of the data you can get .,technology
hundred of trillion of word on the internet but a lot of it is is repetitive or it is search engine search engine optimization drivel or maybe the future will even be text generated by ai itself .,technology
and i think there are limit to what to what can be produced in this way that said we and i would guess other company are working on way to make data synthetic .,technology
no ability to play go whatsoever to above human level by playing against itself there wa no example data from human required in the the alpha go zero version of it .,technology
the other direction of course is these reasoning model that do chain of thought and stop to think .,technology
and and reflect on their own thinking in a way thats another synthetic data coupled with reinforcement learning my my guess with one of those method will get around the data limitation or there may be other source of data that are that are available .,technology
we could observe that even if there no problem with data a we start to scale model up they stop getting better it is it is seen to be our reliable observation that theyve gotten better that could stop at some point for reason we do not understand .,technology
optimization method or some new technique we need to to unblock thing ive seen no evidence of that far but if thing were to slow down that perhaps could be one reason .,technology
what about the limit of compute .,technology
meaning the expensive nature of building bigger bigger data center now i think .,technology
most of the frontier model company i would guess are operating roughly one billion dollar scale plus or minus a factor of three those are the model that exist now or being trained now .,technology
i think next year we are going to go to a few billion and then .,technology
and i would guess that it doe happen now if we get to a hundred billion thats still not enough compute thats still not enough scale then either we need even more scale or we need to develop some way of doing it more efficiently if shifting the curve .,technology
i think between all of these one of the reason i am bullish about powerfully i happening fast is that if you extrapolate the next few point on the curve we are very quickly getting towards .,technology
human level ability some of the new model that that we developed some some some reasoning model that have come from other company they are starting to get to what i would call the phd or professional level if you look at their their coding ability .,technology
and the latest model we released son it three.five the new updated version it get something fifty on sweet bench and sweet bench an example of a bunch of .,technology
i think weve seen similar thing in graduate level math physic and biology from model open a eye one .,technology
if we if we continue to extrapolate this in term of skill skill that we have i think if we extrapolate the straight curve within a few year we will get to these model being .,technology
above the the highest professional level in term of human now will that curve continue you point into an ive pointed to a lot of reason what possible reason why that might not happen .,technology
but if the if the extrapolation curve continues that is the trajectory we are on .,technology
anthropic ha several competitor it is interesting get your view of it all open ai google x ai meta what is the take to .,technology
when in the broad sense of when in the space yeah i want to separate out a couple thing and topic and topic mission is to .,technology
try to make this all go and and we have the theory of change called race to the top race to the top is about trying to push .,technology
push the other player to do the thing by setting an example it is not about being the good guy it is about setting thing up that all of u can be the good guy .,technology
ill give a few example of this early in the history of anthropic one of our cofounder chris all up who i believe you are interviewing soon .,technology
he the cofounder the field of mechanistic interpretability which is an attempt to understand whats going on inside ai model .,technology
we had him and one of our early team focused on this area of interpretability which we think is good for making model safe and transparent .,technology
for three or four year that had no commercial application whatsoever it still doesnt today we are doing some early beta with it and probably it will eventually but .,technology
this is a very very long research bat in one in which weve built in public and share our result publicly and and we did this because we think it is a way to make model safer and interesting thing is that .,technology
a weve done this other company have started doing it a in some case because theyve been inspired by it in some case because they are worried that .,technology
soon that there that there interpretability team else elsewhere a and in a way that take away our competitive advantage because it is that .,technology
now others are doing it a but it is good it is good for the broader system and we have to invent some new thing that we are doing that others are not doing a on the hope .,technology
is to bid up bid up the importance of of of doing the thing and it is not it is not about u in particular it is not about having .,technology
one particular good guy other company can do this a if they if they if they join the race to do this thats thats thats the best news ever .,technology
it is it is it is about shaping the incentive to point upward instead of shaping the incentive to point to point downward and we should say this example the field of a mechanistic interpretability .,technology
is a rigorous non handwavy way of doing it a safety .,technology
yeah whats tending that way trying to i think we are still early .,technology
in term of our ability to see thing but ive been surprised at how much weve been able to look inside these system and understand what we see unlike with the scaling law where it feel there some .,technology
law thats driving these model to perform better on on the inside the model are not there no reason why they should be designed for u to understand them they are designed to operate they are designed to work the human brain or human biochemistry .,technology
and a the side effect you also get to see the beauty of these model you get to explore the beautiful nature of large and you on that work through the mech and turb the dimension .,technology
i am amazed at how clean it is been .,technology
i am amazed at thing induction head i am amazed at thing that that we can you sparse auto encoders to find these direction within the network .,technology
we we released this model a a demo is half a joke for a couple day but it wa it wa a illustrative of the method we developed and .,technology
you could you could take the golden gate you could take the model you could ask it about anything be how you could say how is your day anything you asked because this feature wa activated would connect to the golden gate bridge would say .,technology
i am i am feeling relaxed and expansive much the archer of the golden gate bridge or it would masterfully change topic .,technology
yeah the golden gate bridge and integrated there is also sadness to it to to the focus ahead on the golden gate bridge .,technology
i think people quickly fun and love with it .,technology
i think people already miss it because it wa taken down i think after a day somehow these intervention on the model .,technology
where where where where you adjusted to behavior somehow emotionally made it seem more human .,technology
yeah than any other version of the model strong personality strong identity strong personality it ha these obsessive interest .,technology
we can all think of someone who obsessed with something it doe make it feel somehow a bit more human .,technology
let talk about the present let talk about claude this year a lot ha happened in march .,technology
claude three opus on it hiku were released then claude three five sonna in july with an updated version now released and then also claude three five hiku wa released .,technology
can you explain the difference between opus sonna and hiku and how we should think about the different version .,technology
yeah let go back to march when we first released these three model .,technology
our thinking wa different company produce large and small model better and worse model .,technology
we felt that there wa demand both for a powerful model .,technology
when you might be a little bit slower that youd have to pay more for and also for fast cheap model that are a smart a they can be for how fast and cheap .,technology
whenever you want to do some difficult analysis if i i want to write code for instance or i want to i want to brainstorm idea or i want to do creative writing .,technology
i want the powerful model but then there a lot of practical application and a business sense where it is i am interacting with a website .,technology
i i am doing my tax or i am talking to to a legal advisor and i want to analyze a contract or we have plenty of company that are i want to do auto complete on my on my ide or something .,technology
and for all of those thing you want to act fast and you want to use the model very broadly we want to serve that whole spectrum of need .,technology
we ended up with this this poetry theme and whats a short poem it is a high coup and high coup is the small fast cheap model that is wa at the time wa surprisingly surprisingly intelligent for how fast and cheap it wa .,technology
that that wa the original thinking behind it and our our thinking then wa each new generation of model should shift that trade off curve .,technology
when we release sonnet three.five it ha the same roughly the same cost and speed a the sonnet three model but it increased it intelligence the point where it wa smarter than the original opus three model especially for code but but also in general .,technology
and now weve shown result for a high coup three.five and i believe high coup three.five the smallest new model is about a good a opus three the largest old model .,technology
the aim here is to shift the curve and then at some point there going to be an opus three.five .,technology
now every new generation of model ha it own thing they use new data their personality change in way that we try to steer but are not fully able to steer and there never quite that exact equivalence where the only thing you are changing is intelligence .,technology
we always try to improve other thing and some thing change without u knowing or measuring it is it is very much an exact science in many way the manner and personality of these model is more and are then it is a science .,technology
what is the reason for the span of time between say cloud opus three.zero and three.five what is what take that time if you can speak to .,technology
there different there different process there pre training which is the normal language model training and that take a very long time that us these day .,technology
10 ten of thousand sometimes many ten of thousand of gpus or tpus or training or what we use different platform but accelerator chip often often training for month .,technology
10 there then a post training phase where we do reinforcement learning from human feedback a a other kind of reinforcement learning that that phase is getting larger and larger now and often thats le of an exact science it often take effort to get it .,technology
10 the model of the test it with some of our early partner to see how good they are and they are then tested both internally and externally for their safety particularly for catastrophic and autonomy risk .,technology
10 we do internal testing according to our responsible scaling policy which i could talk more about that in detail .,technology
and then we have an agreement with the u and the uk ai safety institute a a other third party tester and specific domain to test the model for what are called .,technology
cbrn risk chemical biological radiological and nuclear which are we do not think that model pose these risk yet but but every new model we want to evaluate to see if we are starting to get close to some of these these these more dangerous .,technology
10 these more dangerous capability those are the phase and then then then it take some time to get the model working in term of inference and want you to in the api there a lot of step to .,technology
10 to making a model work and of course we are always trying to make the process a streamlined a possible we want our safety testing to be rigorous but we want it to be rigorous and .,technology
10 to be automatic to happen a fast a it can without compromising on rigor same with our pretraining process and our post training process .,technology
it is building anything else it is building airplane you want to make them you want to make them safe but you want to make the process streamlined and i think .,technology
and the idea of tension between those is is an important thing and making the model work yeah room around the street i forget who wa saying that and tropical is good tooling .,technology
10 to be able to have a .,technology
10 to be able to have a a efficient low friction interaction with the infrastructure you would be surprised how much of the challenge of .,technology
10 touching these model come down to soft for engineering performance engineering from the outside you might think man we have this you recap break through this movie with the sign we discovered it we figured it out but .,technology
i think all thing even incredible discovery they almost always come down to the detail .,technology
and often super super boring detail i can not speak to whether we have better tooling than other company .,technology
havent been at those other company at least at least not recently but it is certainly something we give a lot of attention to .,technology
i do not know if you can say but from three from cloud three to cloud three five is there any extra pretraining going on ?,technology
a i mostly focus on the posttraining there been leap in performance .,technology
yeah i think at any given stage we are focused on improving everything at once .,technology
naturally their different team each team make progress in a particular area in making a particular segment of the relay race better .,technology
and it is natural that when we make a new model we put all of these thing in at once .,technology
the data you have the preference data you get from rlhf is that applicable ?,technology
is there a way to apply it to newer model ?,technology
a it get trained up ?,technology
yeah preference data from old model sometimes get used for new model .,technology
although of course it performs somewhat better when it is trained on the new model .,technology
note that we have this constitutional ai method such that we do not only use preference data we there also a posttraining process where we train the model against itself .,technology
and there new type of posttraining the model and it is selfinterviewed every day .,technology
it is not rlhf it is a bunch of other method a . posttraining i think is becoming more and more sophisticated .,technology
what explains the big leap in performance for the new sonic thirty five ?,technology
at least in the programming side .,technology
if this is a good place to talk about benchmark what is not going to get better ?,technology
the number one up .,technology
but id program but i also love programming and i clawed thirty five through cursor what i use to assist me in programming .,technology
and at least experimentially and it is gotten smarter at programming .,technology
what doe it take to get it smarter ?,technology
we observe that a by the way .,technology
there were a couple very strong engineer here at anthropic who all previous code model both produced by u then produced by all the other company hadnt been useful to them .,technology
they said maybe this is useful to beginner it is not useful to me .,technology
but sonic three.five the original one for the first time they said my god this helped me with something that it would have taken the hour to do .,technology
this is the first model that wa saved me time .,technology
again the water line is rising .,technology
and then i think the new sonic ha been even better .,technology
in term of what it take ill say it is been across the board .,technology
it is in the pretraining it is in the posttraining .,technology
it is in various evaluation that we do .,technology
weve observed this a . and if we go into the detail of the benchmark sweet bench is since your programmer youll be familiar with pull request and pull request a topic unit of work .,technology
you could say i am implementing one thing .,technology
and sweet bench give you a realworld situation where the code base is in a current state .,technology
and i am trying to implement something thats described in the scribed in language .,technology
we have internal benchmark where we measure the same thing .,technology
and you say give the model free reign to do anything run anything edit anything how is it able to complete these task .,technology
and it is that benchmark thats gone from it .,technology
it can do it three of the time to it can do it about fifty of the time .,technology
i do believe that if we get you can gain benchmark but i think if we get to one hundred on that benchmark and in a way that is not overtrained or game for that particular benchmark probably represent a real and serious increase in programming programming ability .,technology
and i would suspect that if we can get to ninety nine .,technology
that it will represent ability to autonomously do a significant fraction of software engineering task .,technology
when is cloud opus three.five coming up ?,technology
not giving you an exact date but there a far a we know the plan is still to have a cloud three.five opus .,technology
there wa some game that wa delayed fifteen year .,technology
is that duke nukem forever ?,technology
and i think gta is not releasing trailer .,technology
it is only been three month since we released the first on it .,technology
yeah it is incredible pace of release .,technology
but it tell you about the pace .,technology
the expectation for one thing is you are gon na come out .,technology
what about forty ?,technology
how do you think about a these model get bigger and bigger about versioning ?,technology
and also versioning in general why sonic three.five updated with the date ?,technology
why not ?,technology
sonic three.six which i love .,technology
the naming is an interesting challenge here ?,technology
because i think a year ago most of the model wa pretraining .,technology
and you could start from the beginning and say we are gon na have model of different size .,technology
we are gon na train them all together .,technology
and well have a family of naming scheme .,technology
and then well put some new magic into them .,technology
and then well have the next generation .,technology
the trouble start already when some of them take a lot longer than other to train ?,technology
that already mess up your time time a little bit .,technology
but a you make big improvement in a you make big improvement in pretraining then you suddenly notice i can make better pretrained model and that doesnt take very long to do .,technology
and but clearly it ha the same size and shape of previous model .,technology
i think those two together a with the timing issue any scheme you come up with that the reality tends to frustrate that scheme ?,technology
ten tends to break out of the break out of the scheme .,technology
it is not software you can say this is three.seven this is three.eight .,technology
no you have model with different tradeoff .,technology
you can change some thing in your model .,technology
you can train you can change other thing .,technology
some are faster and slower in front .,technology
some have to be more expensive .,technology
some have to be le expensive .,technology
and i think all the company have struggled with this .,technology
i think we did very i think we were in a good position in term of naming when we had hiku sonnet and chris .,technology
we are trying to maintain it but it is not it is not perfect .,technology
well well try and get back to this simplicity but it it it the the nature of the field .,technology
i feel no one figured out naming .,technology
it is somehow a different paradigm from normal software .,technology
and and we we not of the company have been perfect at it .,technology
and it is something we struggle with surprisingly much relative to how relative to how trivial it is for the the the the grand science of training the model .,technology
from the user side the user experience of the updated sonnet thirty five is different than the previous june two thousand and twenty four sonnet thirty five .,technology
it would be nice to come up with some labeling that embodies that .,technology
because people talk about sonnet thirty five but now there a different one .,technology
and how do you refer to the previous one and the new one ?,technology
and it it when there a distinct improvement it make conversation about it challenging .,technology
i definitely think this question of there are lot of property of the model that are not reflected in the benchmark .,technology
i think thats thats definitely the case and everyone agrees .,technology
and not all of them are capability .,technology
some of them are model can be polite or brusk .,technology
they can be very reactive or they can ask you question .,technology
they can have what what feel a warm personality or a cold personality .,technology
they can be boring or they can be very distinctive golden gate cloud wa .,technology
and we have a whole we have a whole team focused on i think we call it cloud character amanda lead that team and well well talk to you about that .,technology
but it is still a very inexact science .,technology
and and and often we find that model have property that we are not aware of .,technology
the the fact of the matter is that you can talk to a model tenzero time and there are some behavior you might not see .,technology
with a human ?,technology
i can know someone for a few month and not know that they have a certain skill or not know that there a certain side to them .,technology
the normative question is also super interesting .,technology
i got ta ask you a question from reddit .,technology
from reddit .,technology
there there a fascinating to me at least it is a psychological social phenomenon .,technology
where people report that claude ha gotten dumb enough for them over time .,technology
and the question is doe the user complaint about the dumbing down of claude thirty five son at hold any water ?,technology
are these anecdotal report it social phenomenon or did claude is there any case where claude would get dumber ?,technology
this doesnt apply this is not about claude .,technology
i believe this i believe ive seen these complaint for every foundation model produced by major company .,technology
people said this about gpt4 they said it about gpt4 turbo .,technology
couple thing .,technology
one the actual weight of the model ?,technology
the actual brain of the model that doe not change unless we introduce a new model .,technology
there therere a number of reason why it would not make sense practically to be randomly substituting in substituting in new version of the model .,technology
it is difficult from an inference perspective and it is hard to control all the consequence of changing the weight of the model .,technology
let say you wanted to find two in the model to be i do not know to say certainly le which an old version of son that used to do .,technology
you end up changing one hundred thing a . we have a whole process for it and we have a whole process for modifying the model .,technology
we do a bunch of testing on it .,technology
we do a bunch of we do a bunch of user testing in early customer .,technology
we both have never changed the weight of the model without telling anyone .,technology
and it wouldnt certainly in the current setup it would not make sense to do that .,technology
now there are a couple thing that we do occasionally do .,technology
one is sometimes we run ab test .,technology
but those are typically very close to when a model is being released and for a very small fraction of time .,technology
the day before the new son at three.five i agree .,technology
we should have had better name .,technology
it is a clunky to refer to it .,technology
there were some comment from people that it is gotten a lot better .,technology
and thats because a fraction were exposed to an ab test for those one or two day .,technology
the other is that occasionally the system prompt will change .,technology
the system prompt can have some effect although it is unlikely to dumb down model .,technology
it is unlikely to make them dumber .,technology
and weve seen that while these two thing which i am listing to be very complete happen relatively happen quite infrequently .,technology
the complaint about for u and for other model company about the model change the model is not good at this .,technology
the model got more censored .,technology
the model wa dumbed down .,technology
those complaint are constant .,technology
and i do not want to say people are managing to do anything but the model are for the most part not changing .,technology
if i were to offer a theory i think it relates to one of the thing i said before which is that model have many are very complex and have many aspect to them .,technology
and often if i ask them a model a question if i am do task act versus can you do task act ?,technology
the model might respond in different way .,technology
and there are all kind of subtle thing that you can change about the way you interact with the model that can give you very different result .,technology
to be clear this itself is a failing by u and by the other model provider that the model are offensive to small change in word .,technology
it is yet another way in which the science of how these model work is very poorly developed .,technology
and if i go to sleep one night and i wa talking the model in a certain way and i slightly change the phrasing of how i talk to the model i could get different result .,technology
thats one possible way .,technology
the other thing is man it is hard to quantify this stuff .,technology
it is hard to quantify this stuff .,technology
i think people are very excited by new model when they come out and then a time go on they become very aware of the limitation .,technology
that may be another effect but thats all a very longrended way of saying for the most part with some fairly narrow exception the model are not changing .,technology
i think there is a psychological effect .,technology
you start getting used to it the baseline raise .,technology
when people have first gotten wifi on airplane it is a major ... a major ... yeah and then ... now i want to ... get this thing to work .,technology
this is such a piece of crap .,technology
these are to have the conspiracy theory that they are making wifi slower and slower .,technology
this is probably something ill talk to amanda much more about but another reddit question .,technology
one will plot stuff trying to be my pure a tannical grandmother imposing it moral worldview on me a a paying customer .,technology
and also what doe this ecology behind making cloud overly apologetic ?,technology
this report about the experience at different angle in the frustration .,technology
it ha to do with the character .,technology
yeah a couple point on this first .,technology
one is thing that people say on reddit and twitter or actual wherever it is .,technology
there a huge distribution shift between the stuff that people complain loudly about on social medium and what statistically user care about and that drive people to use the model .,technology
people are frustrated with thing the model not writing out all the code or the model .,technology
not being a good at code a it could be even though it is the best model in the world on code .,technology
i think the majority of thing are about that .,technology
but certainly a vocal minority are raised these concern ?,technology
our frustrated by the model refusing thing that shouldnt refuse or apologizing too much .,technology
or having these annoying verbal tick .,technology
the second caveat and i want to say this super clearly because i think it is some people do not know what others know it but forget it .,technology
it is very difficult to control across the board how the model behave .,technology
you can not reach in there and say i want the model to apologize le .,technology
you can do that .,technology
you can include trading data that say the model should apologize le .,technology
but then in some other situation they end up being super rude or overconfident in a way thats misleading people .,technology
there are all these tradeoff .,technology
for example another thing is if there wa a period during which model ours and i think others a were two verbose ?,technology
they would repeat themselves .,technology
they would say too much .,technology
you can cut down on the verbosity by penalizing the model for talking for too long .,technology
what happens when you do that if you do it in a crude way is when the model are coding sometimes theyll say rest of the code go here ?,technology
because theyve learned that thats a way to economize and that they see it and then that leaf the model to be called lazy encoding where they are you can finish the rest of it .,technology
you can there this whackamo aspect where you push on one thing and these other thing start to move a that you may not even notice or measure .,technology
and one of the reason that i care much about grand alignment of the ai system in the future is these system are quite unpredictable .,technology
they are quite hard to steer in control .,technology
and this version we are seeing today of you may want to think better it make another thing worse .,technology
i think thats thats a present day analog of future control problem in ai system that we can start to study today. ?,technology
i think that that difficulty in steering the behavior and making sure that if we push an ai system in one direction it doesnt push in another direction in some other way that we did not want .,technology
i think thats an early sign of thing to come .,technology
and if we can do a good job of solving this problem ?,technology
of you ask the model to to make and distribute smallpox and it say no but it is willing to help you in your graduate level of biology class .,technology
how do we get both of those thing at once ?,technology
it is hard .,technology
it is very easy to go to one side or the other .,technology
and it is a multidimensional problem .,technology
and i i think these question of shaping the model personality .,technology
i think they are very hard .,technology
i think we havent done perfectly on them .,technology
i think weve done the best of all the ai company but still far from perfect .,technology
and i think if we can get this if we can control the control the false positive and false negative in this this is very controlled present day environment will be much better at doing it for the future .,technology
when our worry is the model be super autonomous .,technology
will they be able to make very dangerous thing .,technology
will they be able to autonomously build whole company and are those company aligned .,technology
i i think of this this present task a both vaccine but also good practice for the future .,technology
whats the current best way of gathering user feedback ?,technology
not anecdotal data but large scale data about pain point or the opposite of pain point positive thing .,technology
is it internal testing ?,technology
is it yeah specific group testing a b testing ?,technology
what work ?,technology
typically well have internal model bashings where all of anthropic and tropical is almost one thousand people .,technology
people try and break the model .,technology
they try and interact with it various way .,technology
we have a suite of evalues for it is the model refusing in way that it couldnt .,technology
i think we even had a certainly eval because our our again one point model had this problem where it had this annoying tick where it would respond to a wide range of question by saying certainly i can help you with that .,technology
certainly i would be happy to do that .,technology
certainly this is correct .,technology
and we had a certainly eval which is how often doe the model say certainly ?,technology
but look this is a whackamole .,technology
what if it switch from certainly to definitely ?,technology
every time we add a new eval and we are always evaluating for all the old thing .,technology
we have hundred of these evaluation but we find that there no substitute for human interacting with it .,technology
and it is very much the ordinary product development process .,technology
we have hundred of people within anthropic bash the model then we do then we do external ab test .,technology
sometimes well run test with contractor .,technology
we pay contractor to interact with the model .,technology
you put all of these thing together and it is still not perfect .,technology
you still see behavior that you do not quite want to see ?,technology
you still see the model refusing thing that it doesnt make sense to refuse .,technology
but i i think trying to try and to solve this challenge ?,technology
trying to stop the model from doing genuinely bad thing that know what everyone agrees it shouldnt do ?,technology
everyone everyone everyone everyone agrees that the model shouldnt talk about i do not know child abuse material ?,technology
everyone agrees the model shouldnt do that .,technology
but but at the same time that it doesnt refuse in these dumb and stupid way i think i think drawing that line a finely a possible approaching perfectly is still a challenge .,technology
and we are getting better at it every day but there there a lot to be solved .,technology
and again i would point to that a a an indicator of a challenge ahead in term of steering much more powerful model .,technology
do you think claude four.zero is ever coming up ?,technology
i do not want to commit to any naming scheme because if i say if i say here we are going to have claude four next year and then and then then we decide that we should start over because there a new type of model .,technology
i would expect an normal course of business that claude four would come after claude three.five but but you never know in this wacky field ?,technology
but this idea of scaling is continuing .,technology
scaling is continuing .,technology
there there will definitely be more powerful model coming from u in the model that exist today .,technology
that is that is certain or if there if there are not weve weve deeply failed a a company. . can you explain the responsible scaling policy and the ai safety level standard ai level ?,technology
a much a i am excited about the benefit of these model and we know well talk about that if we talk about machine of loving grace i am i am worried about the risk and i continue to be worried about the risk .,technology
no one should think that machine of loving grace wa me me saying i am no longer worried about the risk of these model .,technology
i think they are two side of the same coin .,technology
the power of the model and their ability to solve all these problem in biology neuroscience economic development governance and peace large part of the economy those those come with risk a with great power come great responsibility ?,technology
thats the the the the two are the two are paired thing that are powerful can do good thing and they can do bad thing .,technology
these are misuse of the model in domain cyber bio radiological nuclear thing that could that could harm or even kill thousand even million of people if they go wrong .,technology
let say let say i am someone who i have a phd in this field i have a paying job .,technology
there much to lose .,technology
why do i want to even though assuming i am completely evil which which most people are not .,technology
why why why would such a person risk their risk their risk their life risk their their legacy their reputation to do something truly truly evil .,technology
if we had a lot more people that the world would be a much more dangerous place .,technology
and my my worry is that by being a a much more intelligent agent ai could break that correlation .,technology
and i i do have serious worry about that .,technology
i believe we can prevent those worry but i think a a counterpoint to machine of loving grace i want to say that this is that i this still serious risk .,technology
are they are they doing what we want them to do ?,technology
it is very difficult to even understand and detail what they are doing let alone let alone control it .,technology
if you fix one thing it creates other problem .,technology
we are getting better and better at solving this .,technology
i do not think this is an unsolvable problem .,technology
i think this is this is a science the safety of airplane or the safety of car or the safety of drug .,technology
i i do not think there any big thing we are missing .,technology
i think we need to get better at controlling these model .,technology
and these are these are the two risk i am worried about .,technology
and our responsible scaling plan which all recognizes a very longwinded answer to your question our our responsible scaling plan is designed to address these two type of risk .,technology
and every time we develop a new model we test it for it ability to do both of these bad thing .,technology
if i were to back up a little bit i think we have it i think we have an interesting dilemma with ai system where they are not yet powerful enough to present these catastrophe .,technology
i do not know that i do not know theyll ever present prevent these catastrophe .,technology
it is possible they will not .,technology
but the the case for work the case for risk is strong enough that we should we should act now .,technology
and they are getting better very very fast. ?,technology
i i testified in the senate that we might have serious bio risk within two to three year .,technology
that wa about a year ago .,technology
thing have preceded preceded a pace .,technology
we have this thing where it is it is it is surprisingly hard to to address these risk because they are not here today .,technology
they do not exist .,technology
they are light ghost .,technology
but they are coming at u fast because the model were improving fast .,technology
how do you deal with something thats not here today doesnt exist but is coming at u very fast .,technology
the solution we came up with for that in collaboration with people the organization meter and paul cristiano is what what what you need for that are you need test to tell you when the risk is getting close ?,technology
you need an early warning system .,technology
and and every time we have a new model we test it for it capability to do these cbrn task a a testing it for how capable it is of doing task autonomously on it own .,technology
and that thats threshold is important for a bunch of other way .,technology
and and what do we then do with these task ?,technology
the rsp develops what weve called an ifthen structure which is if the model pas of certain capability then we impose a certain set of safety and security requirement on them .,technology
today model are whats called asl2 .,technology
model that were asl1 is for system that manifestly do not pose any risk of autonomy or misuse .,technology
for example a chess plane bought deep blue would be asl1 .,technology
it is manifestly the case that you can not use deep blue for anything other than chess .,technology
it wa designed for chess .,technology
no one going to use it to to conduct a masterful cyber attack or to run wild and take over the world .,technology
in fact sometimes they do provide information but not above and beyond a search engine but not in a way that can be stitched together not in a way that end to end is dangerous enough .,technology
asl3 is going to be the point at which the model are hopeful enough to enhance the capability of nonstate actors. . state actor can already do a lot of unfortunately to a high level of proficiency a lot of these very dangerous and destructive thing .,technology
the difference is that nonstate actor are not capable of it .,technology
asl4 getting to the point where these model could it could enhance the capability of a already knowledgeable state actor and or become the main source of such a risk .,technology
if you wanted to engage in such a risk the main way you would do it is through a model .,technology
and then i think asl4 on the autonomy side it is some some amount of acceleration in ai research capability with it within ai model .,technology
and then asl5 is where we would get to the model that are truly capable .,technology
it could exceed humanity and there are ability to do any of these task .,technology
and the point of the ifthen structure commitment is to say look i do not know ive been working with these model for many year and ive been worried about risk for many year .,technology
it is dangerous to cry wolf .,technology
it is dangerous to say this model is risky and people look at it and they say this is manifestly not dangerous .,technology
again it is the the delicacy of the risk is not here today but it is coming out a fast .,technology
how do you deal with that ?,technology
it is vexing to a risk planner to deal with it .,technology
and this if then structure say look we do not want to antagonize a bunch of people .,technology
we do not want to harm our own our our our own ability to have a place in the conversation by imposing these these very honorists burden on model that are not dangerous today .,technology
the if then the trigger commitment is a way to deal with this .,technology
it say you clamped down hard when you can show that the model is dangerous .,technology
and of course what ha to come with that is enough of a buffer threshold that you can you are you are you are you are not at high risk of missing the danger .,technology
it is not a perfect framework .,technology
what do you think that timeline for sl3 is where several of the trigger are fired and what do you think the timeline is for sl4 ?,technology
yeah that is hotly debated within the company .,technology
we are working actively to prepare asl3 security security measure a a asl3 deployment measure .,technology
i am not going to go into detail but weve made weve made a lot of progress on both and we are prepared to be i think ready quite soon .,technology
i would not be surprised at all if we hit asl3 next year .,technology
there wa some concern that we might even hit it this year thats still thats still possible that could still happen .,technology
it is very hard to say but i would be very very surprised if it wa two thousand and thirty .,technology
i think it is much sooner than that .,technology
there a protocol for detecting it if then and then there protocol for how to respond to it .,technology
yes how difficult is the second the latter ?,technology
yeah i think for asl3 it is primarily about security and about filter on the model relating to a very narrow set of area when we deploy the model because asl3 the model is not autonomous yet .,technology
and you do not have to worry about the model itself behaving in a bad way even when it is deployed internally .,technology
i think the asl3 measure are i will not say straight forward .,technology
they are they are rigorous but they are easier to reason about .,technology
i think once we get to asl4 we start to have worry about the model being smart enough that they might sandbag test .,technology
they might not tell the truth about test .,technology
we had some result came out about sleep region and there wa a more recent paper about can the model mislead attempt to sandbag their own ability .,technology
they present themselves a being le capable than they are .,technology
and i think with asl4 there going to be an important component of using other thing than interacting with the model .,technology
for example interpretability or hidden in chain of thought .,technology
where you have to look inside the model and verify via some other mechanism that is not a easily corrupted a what the model say that the model indeed ha some property .,technology
one of the property of the rsp is that we do not specify asl4 until weve hit asl3 .,technology
and i think thats proven to be a wise decision because even with asl3 it again it is hard to know this stuff in detail .,technology
and we want to take a much time a we can possibly take to get these thing .,technology
for asl3 the bad act will be the human .,technology
there a little bit more for asl4 it is both .,technology
i think it is both .,technology
deception and thats where mechanistic interpretability come into play .,technology
and hopefully the technique used for that are not made accessible to the model .,technology
yeah of course you can hook up the mechanistic interpretability to the model itself .,technology
but then youve lost it a reliable indicator of the model state .,technology
there are a bunch of exotic way you can think of that it might also not be reliable .,technology
if the model get smart enough that it can jump computer and read the code where you are looking at it internal state weve thought about some of those .,technology
i think they are exotic enough .,technology
there are way for vendor them unlikely .,technology
but yeah generally you want to you want to preserve mechanistic interpretability a a verification set or test set that separate from the training process of the model .,technology
see i think a these model become better and better conversation and become smarter social engineering becomes a threat to because they they can start being very convincing to the engineer and side company .,technology
computer use there also an analysis within the sandbox of cloud.ai itself but let talk about computer use .,technology
that seems to me super exciting that you can give cloud a task and it take a bunch of action figure it out and it is access to the your computer through screenshots .,technology
can you explain how that work ?,technology
and where thats headed .,technology
yeah it is relatively simple .,technology
cloud ha had for a long time since since cloud three back in march the ability to analyze image and respond to them with text .,technology
the only new thing we added is those image can be screenshots of a computer .,technology
and in response we train the model to give a location on the screen where you can click and or button on the keyboard you can press in order to take action .,technology
and it turn out that with not all that much additional training the model can get quite good at that task .,technology
it is a good example of generalization .,technology
people sometimes say if you get to lower for a bit you are halfway to anywhere ?,technology
because of how much it take to escape the gravity .,technology
if you have a strong free train model i feel you are halfway to anywhere in term of in term of the intelligent space .,technology
and it did not take all that much to get to get cloud to do this .,technology
and you can set that in a loop give the model screen shot tell it what to click on give it the next screen shot tell it what to click on .,technology
and that turn into a full almost 3d video interaction of the model .,technology
and it is able to do all of these tasks. ?,technology
we showed these demo were it is able to fill out spreadsheet to table to interact with a website .,technology
it is able to it is able to open all kind of program different operating system window linux mac .,technology
i think all of that is very exciting .,technology
i will say while in theory there nothing you could do there that you couldnt have done through giving the model the api to drive the computer screen .,technology
this lower the barrier .,technology
and there there a lot of folk who who either are are not in a position to interact with those apis or take them a long time to do .,technology
it is the screen is a universal interface thats a lot easier to interact with .,technology
and i expect over time this is going to lower a bunch of barrier .,technology
now honestly the current model ha there it leaf a lot still to be desired .,technology
and we were we were honest about that in the blog. ?,technology
and we we were careful to warn people hey this thing is not you can not leave this thing to run on your computer for minute and minute .,technology
you got to give this thing boundary and guard rail .,technology
and i think thats one of the reason we released it first in an api form rather than this this hand hand the consumer and and give it control of their of their of their computer .,technology
but but i definitely feel that it is important to get these capability out there a model get more powerful .,technology
we are going to have to grapple with how do we use these capability safely ?,technology
how do we prevent them from being abused ?,technology
and i think i think releasing the model while while the capability are are still are still limited is is very helpful in term of in term of doing that .,technology
i think since it is been released a number of customer i think our rapid it wa maybe wa maybe one of the the most quickest quickest quickest to deploy thing have have made use of it in various way .,technology
people have hooked up demo for window dash top mac linux linux machine .,technology
i think a with a with anything else it it it it come with new exciting ability .,technology
and then then then then then then with those new exciting ability we have to think about how to how to make the model say reliable do what human want them to do .,technology
to the same it is the same story for everything ?,technology
same thing it is that same tension .,technology
but but the possibility of use case here is the the range is incredible .,technology
how much to make it work in the future ?,technology
how much do you have to especially go beyond whats the pretrained model doing ?,technology
do more posttraining rlhf or supervisor finan2 and eur synthetic data for the agent ?,technology
yeah i think speaking at a high level it is our intention to keep investing a lot in making the model better .,technology
i think i think we look at look at some of the some of the bench marx were previous model were could do it six percent of the time .,technology
and now our model had to do it fourteen or twenty two percent of the time .,technology
and yeah we want to get up to the human level reliability of eighty nine percent anywhere else ?,technology
we are on the same curve that we were on with sweenbent where i think i would guess a year from now the model can do this very very reliably but you got to start somewhere .,technology
he thinking it is possible to get to the human level ninety percent doing the same thing you are doing now or is it ha to be special for computer ?,technology
but this is giving the power of action to claw and you could do a lot of powerful thing but you could do a lot of damage also .,technology
no and weve been very aware of that .,technology
look my view is computer use is not a fundamentally new capability the cbrn or autonomy capability are .,technology
it is more it open the aperture for the model to use and apply it existing ability .,technology
going forward certainly this modality of interaction is something we have tested for and that we will continue to test for an rsp going forward .,technology
i think it is probably better to have to learn and explore this capability before the model is super super capable .,technology
yeah there a lot of interesting attack prompt injection because now youve widened the aperture you can prompt inject through stuff on screen .,technology
if this becomes more and more useful then there more more benefit to inject inject stuff into the model .,technology
if it go to certain webpage it could be harmless stuff advertisement or it could be harmful stuff. . yeah weve thought a lot about thing spam capture mass camp .,technology
there all every every if once you could all tell you if youve invented a new technology not necessarily the biggest misuse but the the first misuse youll see scam petty scam .,technology
youll it is it is a thing is all people scamming each other .,technology
it is this it is this thing is all this time .,technology
and and it is every time you got to deal with it it is almost silly to say but it is true bot and spam in general is the thing is it is more and more intelligent .,technology
yes it is there are a lot of i said there are a lot of petty criminal in the world .,technology
and and and it is every new technology is a new way for petty petty criminal to do something something stupid and malicious .,technology
is there any idea about sandboxing it ?,technology
how difficult is the sandboxing task ?,technology
yeah we sandboxed during training .,technology
for example during training we did not expose the model to the internet .,technology
i think thats probably a bad idea during training because the model can be changing it policy it can be changing what it is doing and it is having an effect in the real world .,technology
in term of deploying the model it depends in the application .,technology
sometimes you want the model to do something in the real world but of course you can always put guardrail on the outside ?,technology
you can say this model not going to move data from my model not going to move any file from my computer or my web server to anywhere else .,technology
and there we need to think about mechanistic interpretability about if we are going to have a sandbox it would need to be a mathematically approval sandbox thats a whole different world than what we are dealing with with the model today .,technology
yeah the science of building a box from which asl4 asl4 system can not escape .,technology
i think it is probably not the approach .,technology
i think i think containing bad model is much worse solution than having good model .,technology
let me ask about regulation .,technology
whats the role of regulation in keeping asl safe ?,technology
for example he described california ai regulation bill sb one thousand and forty seven that wa ultimately vetoed by the governor .,technology
what are the pro and con of this bill ?,technology
yeah we ended up making some suggestion to the bill and then some of those were adopted and we felt i think quite positively quite positively about about the bill by the end of that .,technology
it did still have some downside and of course of course you got vetoed .,technology
i think at a high level i think some of the key idea behind the bill are i would say similar to idea behind our rsps .,technology
and i think it is very important that some jurisdiction whether it is california or the federal government and or other country and other state pass some regulation this .,technology
and i can talk through why i think thats important .,technology
i feel good about our rsp .,technology
it is not perfect .,technology
but one there are still some company that do not have rsp mechanism openai google did adopt these mechanism a couple month after after andthropic did .,technology
but there are other company out there that do not have these mechanism at all .,technology
and if some company adopt these mechanism and others do not it is going to create a situation where some of these danger have the property that it doesnt matter if three out of five of the company are being safe .,technology
if the other two are being are being unsafe it creates this negative externality .,technology
and i think the lack of uniformity is not fair to those of u who have put a lot of effort into being very thoughtful about these procedure .,technology
the second thing is i do not think you can trust these company to adhere to these voluntary plan in their own. . i to think that anthropic will we do everything we can that we will our rsp is checked by our longterm benefit trust .,technology
we do everything we can to to adhere to our own rsp .,technology
but you hear lot of thing about various company saying they said they would do they said they would give this much compute and they did not they said they would do this thing and they did not .,technology
i do not think it make sense to litigate particular thing that company have done .,technology
but i think this broad principle that if there nothing watching over them there nothing watching over u a an industry there no guarantee that well do the thing and the stake are very high .,technology
and i think it is i think it is important to have a uniform standard that that that that that everyone follows .,technology
and to make sure that simply that the industry doe what a majority of the industry ha already said it is important and ha already said that they definitely will do. . some people i think there there a class of people who are against regulation on principle .,technology
i understand where that come from .,technology
if you go to europe and something gdpr some of the other stuff that that that that that theyve done some of it is good .,technology
but but some of it is unnecessarily burdensome .,technology
and i think it is fair to say ha slowed ha slowed innovation .,technology
and i understand where people are coming from on prior .,technology
i understand why people come from start from that start from that position .,technology
but but again i think ai is different .,technology
if we go to the very serious risk of autonomy and misuse that that i talked about a a few minute ago i think that those are unusual and they warrant an unusually strong response .,technology
and i think it is very important .,technology
again we need something that everyone can get behind .,technology
i think one of the issue with sb one thousand and forty seven especially the original version of it wa it had a bunch of the structure of rsps .,technology
but it also had a bunch of stuff that wa either a clunky or that that that would have created a bunch of burden a bunch of hassle .,technology
and might even have missed the target in term of addressing the risk .,technology
you do not hear about it on twitter .,technology
you hear about people are cheering for any regulation .,technology
and then the folk who are against make up these often quite intellectually dishonest argument about how itll make u move away from california bill doesnt apply if you are headquarter in california bill only applies if you do business in california .,technology
or that it would damage the open source ecosystem or that it would it would cause all of these thing .,technology
i think those were mostly nonsense but there are better argument against regulation .,technology
there one guy dean ball who i think a very scholarly analyst who look at what happens when a regulation is put in place and way that they can get a life of their own or how they can be poorly designed .,technology
and our interest ha always been we do think there should be regulation in this space .,technology
but we want to be an actor who make sure that that that that regulation is something thats surgical thats targeted at the serious risk .,technology
and it is something people can comply with .,technology
because something i think the advocate of regulation do not understand a a they could is if we get something in place that is thats poorly targeted that waste a bunch of people time .,technology
whats going to happen is people are going to say see the safety risk there this is this is nonsense .,technology
i i had to hire ten lawyer to to fill out all these forum .,technology
i had to run all of these test for something that wa clearly not dangerous .,technology
and after six month of that there will be there will be a groundswell .,technology
and well end up with a durable consensus against regulation .,technology
and the i think the worst enemy of those who want real accountability is badly designed regulation .,technology
and and this is if there one thing i could say to the advocate it would be that i want them to understand this dynamic better .,technology
and we need to be careful .,technology
and we need to talk to people who have who have experience seeing how regulation play out in practice .,technology
and and the people who have seen that understand to be very careful .,technology
if this wa some lesser issue i might be against regulation at all .,technology
but what what i want the opponent to understand is is that the underlying issue are serious .,technology
they are they are not they are not something that i or the other company are making up because of regulatory capture .,technology
they are not scifi fantasy .,technology
they are not they are not any of these thing .,technology
every every time we have a new model every few month we measure the behavior of these model .,technology
and they are getting better and better at these concerning task a they are getting better and better at good valuable economically useful task .,technology
and i i i i would love it if some of the former i think sb one thousand and forty seven wa very polarizing .,technology
i would love it if some of the most reasonable opponent and some of the most reasonable proponent would sit down together .,technology
and i think i think that the different the different ai company and thropic wa the only ai company that felt positively in a very detailed way .,technology
i think elon tweeted tweeted briefly something positive .,technology
but some of the some of the big one google openai meta microsoft were were pretty strong staunchly against .,technology
and and i think for for whatever reason that thing got too polarized and those two group did not get to sit down in the way that they should .,technology
and and i feel i feel urgency .,technology
i think we need to do something in two thousand and twenty five .,technology
if we get to the end of two thousand and twenty five and we still done nothing about this then i am going to be worried .,technology
i am not i am not worried yet because again the risk are not here yet but but i think time is running short .,technology
and come up with something surgically you said .,technology
and we need to get we need to get away from this this intense prosafety versus intense antiregulatory rhetoric .,technology
it is turned into these these flame war on twitter .,technology
and nothing good is going to come with that .,technology
there a lot of curiosity about the different player in the game .,technology
one of the ogs is openai .,technology
you have had several year of experience at openai .,technology
whats your story in history there ?,technology
yeah i wa at openai for roughly five year .,technology
for the last i think it wa a couple year i wa vice president of research there .,technology
probably myself and iliusuits giver were the one who set the set the research direction around two thousand and sixteen or two thousand and seventeen .,technology
i first started to believe in or at least confirm my belief in the scaling hypothesis when ilius famously said to me the thing you need to understand about these model is they want to learn .,technology
the model want to learn .,technology
and and again sometimes there are these one sentence these zen cone that you hear them and you are that explains everything .,technology
that explains a thousand thing that ive seen .,technology
and then i i ever after i had this visualization my head of you optimize the model in the way .,technology
you point the model in the way .,technology
they want to learn .,technology
they want to solve the problem .,technology
regardless of what the problem is .,technology
get out of their way .,technology
get out of their way .,technology
yeah do not impose your own idea about how they should learn .,technology
and this wa the same thing a rich sutton put out in the bitter lesson or gurn put out in the scaling hypothesis .,technology
i think generally the dynamic wa i got i got this inspiration from from from from from ilian from others folk alicrad fridge who did the the original g p t one .,technology
and then ran hard with it .,technology
me and my collaborator on gpt two gpt three are all from human feedback which wa an attempt to deal with the early safety and durability .,technology
thing debate and amplification heavy on interpretability .,technology
why do you leave ?,technology
why said to leave ?,technology
the first one i think openai wa wa getting wa getting on board with .,technology
and look there were many many discussion about should the or should the company do this the company do that ?,technology
there a bunch of misinformation out there .,technology
people say we left because we did not the deal with microsoft .,technology
false although it wa a lot of discussion a lot of question about exactly how we do the deal with microsoft .,technology
we left because we did not commercialization .,technology
thats not true .,technology
we built gpd3 which wa the model that wa commercialized .,technology
i wa involved in commercialization .,technology
it is it is more again about how do you do it ?,technology
civilization is going down this path to very powerful ai .,technology
whats the way to do it that is cautious straightforward honest that build trust in the organization and individual how do we get from here to there ?,technology
and how do we have a real vision for how to get it ?,technology
how can safety not be some thing we say because it help with recruiting ?,technology
and i think i think at the end of the day if you have a vision for that forget about anyone el vision .,technology
i do not want to talk about anyone el vision if you have a vision for how to do it you should go off and you should do that vision .,technology
it is incredibly unproductive to try and argue with someone el vision .,technology
you might think they are not doing it the way .,technology
you might think they are they are dishonest .,technology
who know maybe you are maybe you are not .,technology
but what you should do is you should take some people you trust and you should go off together and you should make your vision happen .,technology
and the fact that you were doing it especially the fact that you are doing it better than they are cause them to change their behavior in a much more compelling way than if they are your bos and you are arguing with them .,technology
i i do not know how to be any more specific about it than that .,technology
but i think it is generally very unproductive to try and get someone el vision to look your vision .,technology
it is much more productive to go off and do a clean experiment and say this is our vision this is how this is how we are going to do thing .,technology
your choice is you can you can ignore u you can reject what we are doing or you can you can start to become more u and imitation is the sincerest form of flattery .,technology
and that that that play out in the behavior of customer that pay out in the behavior of the public that play out in the behavior of where people choose to work .,technology
and again again at the end it is it is not about one company winning or another company winning .,technology
if we are another company or engaging in some practice that people find genuinely appealing .,technology
and i want it to be in substance not in appearance .,technology
and i think i think researcher are sophisticated and they will get substance .,technology
and then other company start copying that practice and they win because they copied that practice .,technology
thats great .,technology
thats success .,technology
thats the race to the top .,technology
it doesnt matter who win in the end a long a everyone is copying everyone el good practices. ?,technology
one way i think of it is the thing we are all afraid of is the race to the bottom. ?,technology
and the race to the bottom doesnt matter who win because we all lose. ?,technology
in the most extreme world we make this autonomous ai that the robot and slave u or whatever. ?,technology
thats half joking but that that is the most extreme thing that could happen .,technology
then then it doesnt matter which company wa ahead .,technology
if instead you create a race to the top where people are competing to engage in good in good practice .,technology
then at the end of the day it doesnt matter who end up winning .,technology
it doesnt even matter who started the race to the top .,technology
the point is not to be virtuous .,technology
the point is to get the system into a better equilibrium than it wa before .,technology
and and individual company can play some role in doing this .,technology
individual company can can help to start it can help to accelerate it .,technology
and frankly i think individual at other company have done this a . ?,technology
the individual that when we put out an rsp react by pushing harder to get something similar done get something similar done at at at other company .,technology
sometimes other company do something thats we are it is a good practice .,technology
we think we think thats good .,technology
we should adopt it too .,technology
the only difference is i think we are we try to be more forwardbleaning .,technology
we try to adopt more of these practice first and adopt them more quickly when others invent them .,technology
but i think this dynamic is what we should be pointing at .,technology
and that i think i think it abstract away the question of which company winning who trust who i think all these all these question of drama are are profoundly uninteresting .,technology
and the thing that matter is the ecosystem that we all operate in and how to make that ecosystem better because that constrains all the player .,technology
and in thropock is this clean experiment built on a foundation of what concretely aict should look .,technology
we are look i am sure weve made plenty of mistake along the way .,technology
the perfect organization doesnt exist .,technology
it ha to deal with the the imperfection of a thousand employee .,technology
it ha to deal with the imperfection of our leader including me .,technology
it ha to deal with the imperfection of the people weve put weve put to oversee the imperfection of the of the leader the the board and the longterm benefit trust .,technology
it is it is all it is all a set of imperfect people trying to aim imperfectly at some ideal that will never perfectly be achieved .,technology
thats what you sign up for .,technology
thats what it will always be .,technology
but imperfect doesnt mean you give up .,technology
there better and there worse .,technology
and hopefully hopefully we can begin to build we can do enough that we can begin to build some practice that the whole industry engages in .,technology
and then my guess is that multiple of these company will be successful .,technology
and tropical will be successful .,technology
these other company once ive been at the past will also be successful .,technology
and some will be more successful than others .,technology
thats le important than again that we we align the incentive of the industry .,technology
and that happens partly through the race to the top partly through thing rsp partly through again selected surgical regulation .,technology
you said talent density beat talent mass .,technology
can you explain that ?,technology
can you expand on that ?,technology
can you talk about what it take to build a great team of ai researcher and engineer ?,technology
this is one of these statement thats more true every every every month every month .,technology
i see this statement a more true than i did the month before .,technology
if i were to do with thought experiment let say you have a team of one hundred people that are super smart motivated in the line with the mission and thats your company .,technology
or you can have a team of one thousand people where two hundred people are super smart super lined with the mission .,technology
and then eight hundred people are let say you pick eight hundred random random big tech employee .,technology
which would you rather have ?,technology
the talent mass is greater in the group of in the group of one thousand people .,technology
you have even a larger number of incredibly talented incredibly aligned incredibly smart people .,technology
but the issue is that if every time someone super talented look around they see someone else super talented and super dedicated that set the tone for everything .,technology
that set the tone for everyone is super inspired to work at the same place .,technology
if you have a thousand or tenzero people and thing have regressed ?,technology
you are not able to do selection and you are choosing random people .,technology
what happens is then you need to put a lot of process and a lot of guardrail in place .,technology
because people do not fully trust each other .,technology
you have to adjudicate political battle .,technology
there are many thing that slow down the orgs ability to operate .,technology
and we are nearly a thousand people .,technology
and weve tried to make it that a large a fraction of those thousand people a possible are super talented super skilled .,technology
it is one of the reason weve weve slowed down hiring a lot in the last few month .,technology
we grew from three hundred to eight hundred i believe .,technology
i think in the first seven eight month of the year .,technology
and now weve slowed down .,technology
we are at last three month we went from eight hundred to nine hundred to nine hundred and fifty something that .,technology
do not quote me on the exact number .,technology
but i think there an inflection point around the thousand and we want to be much more careful how we grow early on .,technology
and now a weve hired a lot of physicist .,technology
theoretical physicist can learn thing fast .,technology
even even more recently a weve continued to hire that weve had a high bar for on both the research side and the software engineering side have hired a lot of senior people including folk who used to be at other other company in this space .,technology
and we continued to be very selective .,technology
it is very easy to go from one hundred to one thousand to one thousand to tenzero without paying attention to making sure everyone ha a unified purpose .,technology
it is powerful .,technology
if your company consists of a lot of different freedom that all want to do their own thing they are all optimizing for their own thing .,technology
it is very hard to get anything done .,technology
but if everyone see the broader purpose of the company if there trust and there dedication to doing the thing that is a superpower .,technology
that in itself i think can overcome almost every other disadvantage .,technology
and it is the steve job a player .,technology
a player want to look around and see other a player .,technology
there another wave of saying .,technology
i do not know what that is about human nature but it is demotivating to see people who are not obsessively driving towards a single emission .,technology
and it is on the flip side of that super motivating to see that .,technology
it is interesting .,technology
whats it take to be a great ai researcher or engineer from everything youve seen for work and with many amazing people ?,technology
i think the number one quality especially on the research side but both is openmindedness .,technology
sound is easy to be openminded .,technology
you are i am open to anything .,technology
but if i think about my own early history in the scaling hypothesis i wa seeing the same data others were seen .,technology
i do not think i wa a better programmer or better at coming up with research idea than any of the hundred of people that i worked with .,technology
in some way in some way i wa worse .,technology
ive never precise programming of finding the bug writing the gpu kernel .,technology
i could point you to a hundred people here who are better who are better at that than i am .,technology
but the thing that i think i did have that wa different wa that i wa willing to look at something with new eye .,technology
people said we do not have the algorithm yet .,technology
we havent come up with the the way to do thing .,technology
this neural net ha thirty billion thirty million parameter .,technology
what if we gave it fifty million instead ?,technology
that that basic scientific mindset of man i i i see some variable that i could change .,technology
what happens when it change ?,technology
let try these different thing and create a graph .,technology
for even this this wa the simplest thing in the world .,technology
change the number of this wasnt phd level experimental design .,technology
this wa simple and stupid .,technology
anyone could have done this if you hold them that it wa important .,technology
it is also not hard to understand .,technology
you did not need to be brilliant to come up with this .,technology
but you put the two thing together and some tiny number of people some single digit number of people have driven forward the whole field by realizing this .,technology
and it is it is often that if you look back at the discovery the discovery in history they are they are often that .,technology
and this this opened mindedness and this willingness to see with new eye that often come from being newer to the field .,technology
often experience is a disadvantage for this .,technology
that is the most important thing .,technology
it is very hard to look for and test for .,technology
but i think i think it is the most important thing because when you when you find something some new way of thinking thinking about thing when you have the initiative to do that it is absolutely transformative .,technology
and also be able to do rapid experimentation and in the face of that be open minded and curious and looking at the data for these fresh eye and seeing what is that it is saying that applies in a mechanism to interpret ability .,technology
it is another example of this .,technology
some of the early work in backandest to interpret ability simple .,technology
it is no one thought to care about this question before .,technology
you said what it take to be a great air research .,technology
can we rewind the clock back ?,technology
what advice would you give to people interested in ai ?,technology
they are young looking forward to how can i make an impact on the world ?,technology
i think my number one piece of advice is to start playing with the model .,technology
this wa i worry a little this seems obvious advice .,technology
now i think three year ago it wasnt obvious and people started by let me read the latest reinforcement learning paper .,technology
no that wa the that wa the and you should do that a . but now with wider availability of model and apis people are doing this more .,technology
but i think i think experiential knowledge .,technology
these model are new artifact that no one understands .,technology
and getting experience playing with them .,technology
i would also say again in line with the do something new thinking some new direction .,technology
there are all these thing that havent been explored .,technology
for example mechanistic interpretability is still very new .,technology
it is probably better to work on that than it is to work on new model architecture because it is it is more popular than it wa before .,technology
there are probably one hundred people working on it .,technology
but there are not tenzero people working on it .,technology
and it is this fertile area for study .,technology
there there much lowhanging fruit .,technology
you can walk by and you can walk by and you can pick thing .,technology
and the only reason for whatever reason people are not interested in it enough i think there are some thing around long horizon learning and long horizon task where there a lot to be done .,technology
i think evaluation are still we are still very early in our ability to study evaluation particularly for dynamic system acting in the world .,technology
i think there some stuff around multiagent .,technology
skate where the puck is going is my advice .,technology
and you do not have to be brilliant to think of it .,technology
all the thing that are going to be exciting in five year and people even mentioned them a conventional wisdom .,technology
but it is somehow there this barrier that people do not people do not double down a much a they could or they are afraid to do something thats not the popular thing .,technology
i do not know why it happens but getting over that barrier .,technology
thats the my number one piece of advice .,technology
let talk if it could a bit about posttraining .,technology
it seems that the modern posttraining recipe ha a little bit of everything .,technology
supervised fine tuning rlachf the constitutional ai wa rlaif .,technology
thats dr. and it is the again that naming thing .,technology
and then synthetic data seems a lot of synthetic data or at least trying to figure out way to have high quality synthetic data .,technology
whats the if this is a secret sauce that make anthropic cloth incredible ?,technology
how much of the magic is in the pretraining ?,technology
how much is in the posttraining ?,technology
first of all we are not perfectly able to measure that ourselves .,technology
when some great character ability sometimes it is hard to tell whether it came from pretraining or posttraining .,technology
weve developed way to try and distinguish between those two but they are not perfect .,technology
the second thing i would say is when there is not advantage and i think weve been pretty good in general in general at rl perhaps perhaps the best although i do not know because i do not see what go on inside other company .,technology
usually it is not my god we have this secret magic method that others do not have .,technology
usually it is we got better at the infrastructure we could run it for longer or you are able to get higher quality data or we were able to filter our data better or we were able to combine these method and practice .,technology
it is usually some boring matter of practice and trade craft .,technology
when i think about how to do something special in term of how we train these model both pretraining but even more posttraining i think of it a little more again a designing airplane or car .,technology
it is not man i have the blueprint .,technology
maybe that make you make the next airplane but there some cultural trade craft of how we think about the design process that i think is more important than any particular gizmo or able to invent .,technology
first on rlhf what do you think zooming out into asian almost philosophy ?,technology
what do you think rlhf work ?,technology
in that human are often not able to perfectly identify what the model want and what human want in the moment may not be what they want in the long term .,technology
there a lot of subtlety there but the model are good at producing what the human and some shallow sense want .,technology
and it turn out that you do not even have to throw that much compute at it because of another thing which is this thing about a strong pretrained model being halfway anywhere .,technology
once you have the pretrained model you have all the representation you need to get the model to get the model where you want it to go .,technology
do you think our rlhf make the model smarter or appears smarter to the human ?,technology
i do not think it make the model smarter .,technology
i do not think it make the model appear smarter .,technology
it is rlhf bridge the gap between the human and the model .,technology
i could have something smart that can not communicate at all .,technology
we all know people this .,technology
people who are smart but you can not understand what they are saying .,technology
i think rlhf bridge that gap .,technology
i think it is not the only rl we do .,technology
it is not the only rl that will happen in the future .,technology
i think rl ha the potential to make model smarter to make them reasoned better to make them operate better to develop new skill even .,technology
and perhaps that could be done even in some case with human feedback .,technology
but the rlhf we do today mostly doesnt do that yet .,technology
although we are very quickly starting to be able to but it appears to increase if you look at the metric of healthfulness .,technology
it increase that .,technology
it also increase .,technology
what wa this word in leopolds essay ?,technology
or the model are hobbled .,technology
and then you do various training to them to unhovele them .,technology
i that word because it is a rlhf i think rlhf unhoveles the model in some way .,technology
and then there are other way where model hasnt yet been unhovable and need done .,technology
if you can say in term of cost it is pretraining the most expensive thing or is posttraining creep up to that .,technology
at the present moment it is still the case that pretraining is the majority of the cost .,technology
i do not know what to expect in the future but i could certainly anticipate a future where posttraining is the majority of the cost .,technology
in that future you anticipate would it be the human or the ai thats the cost they think for the posttraining ?,technology
i do not think you can scale up human enough to get high quality .,technology
any method that relies on human and us a large amount of compute it is going to have to rely on some scaled supervision method debate or iterated amplification or something that .,technology
on that super interesting set of idea around constitutional ai can describe what it is a first detailed into summer two thousand and twenty .,technology
yes two paper and beyond that .,technology
what is it ?,technology
yes this wa from two year ago .,technology
thats hard because you need to scale up human interaction and it is very implicit .,technology
i do not have a sense of what i want the model to do .,technology
i have a sense of what this average of a thousand human want the model to do .,technology
two idea one is could the ai system itself decide which response is better ?,technology
could you show the ai system these two response and ask which response is better and then second what criterion should the ai use ?,technology
it is a form of selfplay .,technology
you are training the model against itself .,technology
and the ai give the response and then you feed that back into whats called the preference model which in turn feed the model to make it better .,technology
you have this triangle of the ai the preference model and the improvement of the ai itself .,technology
and we should say that in the constitution the set of principle are human interpretable .,technology
they are yeah yeah it is something both the human and the ai system can read .,technology
it ha this nice this nice translatable idea or symmetry .,technology
in practice we both use a model constitution and we use rlhf and we use some of these other method .,technology
it is turned into one tool in a tool kit that both reduces the need for rlhf and increase the value we get from using each data point of rlhf .,technology
it also interacts in interesting way with future reasoning type rl method .,technology
it is one tool in the tool kit but i think it is a very important tool .,technology
but it is a compelling one to u human think about the foundy father and the foundy of the united state .,technology
the natural question is who and how do you think it get to define the constitution the set of principle in the constitution ?,technology
yeah ill give a practical answer and a more abstract answer .,technology
i think the practical answer is look in practice model get used by all kind of different customer ?,technology
and you can have this idea where the model can have specialized rule or principle we find two inversion of model .,technology
and implicitly weve talked about doing it explicitly having having special principle that people can build into the model .,technology
from a practical perspective the answer can be very different from different people customer service agent behaves very differently from the lawyer and obeys different principle .,technology
but i think at the base of it there are specific principle that model have to obey .,technology
i think a lot of them are thing that people would agree with .,technology
everyone agrees that we do not we do not want model to present these cbrn risk .,technology
i think we can go a little further and agree with some basic principle of democracy and the rule of law .,technology
beyond that it get very uncertain .,technology
and there are goal generally for the model to be more neutral to not a spouse the particular point of view .,technology
and more be wise agent or advisor that will help you think thing through .,technology
and will present present possible consideration but do not express strong or specific opinion .,technology
open ai released a model spec where clearly concretely defines some of the goal of the model and specific example ab how the model should behave .,technology
do you find that interesting ?,technology
by the way i should mention the i believe the brilliant john schumann wa a part of that .,technology
he not an anthropic .,technology
do you think this is useful direction ?,technology
my anthropic release a model spec a ?,technology
i think thats a pretty useful direction .,technology
again it ha a lot in common with constitutional ai .,technology
again another example of a race to the top ?,technology
we have something thats we think a better and more responsible way of doing thing .,technology
it is also a competitive advantage .,technology
then others discover that it ha advantage .,technology
and then start to do that thing .,technology
we that no longer have the competitive advantage but it is good from the perspective that now everyone ha adopted a positive practice that others were not adopting .,technology
and our response to that a look we need a new competitive advantage in order to keep driving this race upwards .,technology
thats thats how i generally feel about that i also think every implementation of these thing is different .,technology
there were some thing in the model spec that were not in constitutional ai .,technology
and we we can always we can always adopt those thing or at least learn from them .,technology
again i think this is an example of the positive dynamic that that that that that i that i think we should all want to feel to have .,technology
let talk about the incredible essay .,technology
grace i recommend everybody read it .,technology
it is a long one .,technology
it is rather long .,technology
it is refreshing to re concrete idea about what a positive future look .,technology
and you took a bold stance because it is very possible that you might be wrong on the date or specific .,technology
yeah i am fully expecting to to definitely be wrong about all the detail .,technology
i might be spectacularly wrong about the whole thing and people will well laugh at me for year .,technology
thats thats thats how the future work .,technology
you provided a bunch of concrete positive impact of ai and how exactly a super intelligent ai might accelerate the rate of breakthrough .,technology
and for example biology and chemistry that would then lead to thing we cure most cancer prevent all infectious disease double the human lifespan and on .,technology
let talk about the essay first .,technology
can you give a high level vision of the essay and what key takeaway that people have ?,technology
yeah i have spent a lot of time in anthropica .,technology
i spent a lot of effort on how do we address the risk of ai ? ?,technology
how do we think about those risk ?,technology
we are trying to do a race to the top what that requires u to build all these capability and the capability are cool .,technology
but we are we are a big part of what we are trying to do is address the risk .,technology
and then a vacation for that is all these positive thing the market is this very healthy organism ?,technology
it is going to produce all the positive thing .,technology
the risk i do not know we might mitigate them .,technology
and we can have more impact by trying to mitigate the risk .,technology
but i noticed that one flaw in that way of thinking and it is it is not a change in how serious light take the risk .,technology
it is it is maybe a change in how i talk about them .,technology
is that no matter how logical or rational that line of reasoning that i gave might be if if you only talk about risk your brain only think about risk .,technology
and and i think it is very important to understand what if thing do go .,technology
and the whole reason we are trying to prevent these risk is not because we are afraid of technology not because we want to slow it down .,technology
it is it is it is because if we can get to the other side of these risk ?,technology
if we can run the gauntlet successfully to put it in stark term then then on the other side of the gauntlet are all these great thing .,technology
and these thing are worth fighting for .,technology
and these thing can inspire people .,technology
and i think i imagine because look you have all these investor all these vcs all these ai company talking about all the positive benefit of ai .,technology
but a you point out it is it is it is weird .,technology
there a earth of getting specific about it .,technology
there a lot of random people on twitter posting these gleaming city and this this vibe of grind accelerate harder kick out the diesel .,technology
it is it is this very this very aggressive ideological .,technology
but then you are what are you what what are you excited about ?,technology
and and i figured that i think it would be interesting and valuable for someone who coming from the risk side to try and and to try and make a try at at explaining explaining what the benefit are .,technology
both because i think it is something we can all get behind .,technology
and i want people to understand .,technology
i want them to understand that this is not this is not dumers versus accelerationists .,technology
this this is that if you have a true understanding of where thing are going with with ai and maybe thats the more important access .,technology
ai is moving fast versus ai is not moving fast .,technology
then you appreciate the benefit and you you you you you you you you want humanity .,technology
our civilization disease those benefit .,technology
but you also get very serious about anything that could derail them .,technology
i think the starting point is to talk about what this powerfully i which is the term you to use most of the world us agi but you do not the term because it is ha too much baggage .,technology
it is become meaningless .,technology
it is we are stuck with the term .,technology
maybe we are stuck with the term and my effort to change them are futile .,technology
it is admirable .,technology
ill tell you what else i do not this is a pointless semantic point .,technology
i think it is it is a little let say it wa one thousand nine hundred and ninety five and moore law making the computer faster .,technology
and for some reason there there there had been this verbal tick that everyone wa someday we are going to have super computer .,technology
and super computer are going to be able to do all these thing that once we have super computer well be able to sequence that and well be able to do other thing .,technology
and and one it is true the computer are getting faster and a they get faster they are going to be able to do all these great thing .,technology
but there there no discrete point at which you had a super computer and previous computer were not to super computer at term we use .,technology
but it is a vague term to describe computer that are faster than what we have today .,technology
there no point at which you pas the threshold and you are my god we are doing a new type of computation and new .,technology
and i feel that way about agi .,technology
there a smooth exponential .,technology
and if by agi you mean agi is getting better and better and gradually it is going to do more and more of what human do and told it is going to be smarter than human .,technology
and then it is going to get smarter even from there than then yes i believe in agi .,technology
but if if agi is some discrete or separate thing which is the way people often talk about it then it is a meaningless buzzword .,technology
yeah to me it is a platonic form of a powerful ai exactly how you define it .,technology
you find it very nicely .,technology
on the intelligence axis it is on pure intelligence .,technology
it is smarter than a nobel prize winner a you describe across most relevant discipline .,technology
thats intelligence .,technology
it is both in creativity and being able to generate new idea all that stuff in every discipline nobel prize winner .,technology
in their prime .,technology
it can use every modality .,technology
this selfexplanatory but operate across all the modality of the world .,technology
it can go off for many hour day and week to do task and do it own detailed planning and only ask you help when it is needed .,technology
it can use this is interesting .,technology
i think in the s you said again it is a bet thats not going to be embodied but it can control embodied tool .,technology
it can control tool robot laboratory equipment .,technology
the resource used to train it can then be repurposed to run million of copy of it .,technology
and each of those copy would be independent that can do their own independent work .,technology
you can do the cloning of the intelligence .,technology
yes you might imagine from outside the field that there only one of these ?,technology
you made it youve only made one .,technology
but the truth is that the scale up is very quick .,technology
we do this today .,technology
we make a model and then we deploy thousand maybe ten of thousand of instance of it .,technology
i think by the time certainly within two to three year whether we have these super powerful ai or not cluster are going to get to the size where youll be able to deploy million of these .,technology
and theyll be faster than human .,technology
and if your picture is all well have one and then itll take a while to make them my point there wa no you have million of them away .,technology
and in general they can learn and act ten to one hundred time faster than human .,technology
thats a nice definition of powerful ai .,technology
that but you also write that clearly such an entity would be capable of solving very difficult problem very fast .,technology
but it is not trivial to figure out how fast .,technology
two extreme position both seem false to me .,technology
the singularity is on the one extreme and the opposite and the other extreme .,technology
can you describe each of the extreme ?,technology
yeah and why ?,technology
yeah let describe the extreme .,technology
one extreme would be look .,technology
if we look at evolutionary history there wa this big acceleration where for hundred of thousand of year we had singlecell organism and then we had mammal and then we had ape and then that quickly turned to human .,technology
human quickly built industrial civilization .,technology
and this is going to keep speeding up .,technology
and there no ceiling at the human level .,technology
once model get much much smarter than human theyll get good at building the next model .,technology
and if you write down a simple differential equation this is an exponential .,technology
and whats whats going to happen is that model will build faster model model will build faster model .,technology
and those model will build nanobots that can take over the world and produce much more energy than you could produce otherwise .,technology
and if you solve this abstract differential equation then five day after we we build the first ai thats more powerful than human then the world will be filled with these ai in every possible technology that could be invented will be invented .,technology
i am caricaturing this a little bit .,technology
but i think thats one extreme .,technology
and the reason that i think thats not the case is that one i think they neglect the law of physic it is only possible to do thing fast in the physical world .,technology
some of those loop go through producing faster hardware take a long time to produce faster hardware thing take a long time .,technology
there this issue of complexity .,technology
i think no matter how smart you are people talk about we can make model of biological system that will do everything the biological system .,technology
i think computational modeling can do a lot .,technology
even if it is not interacting with a physical world the modeling is going to be hard .,technology
yeah i think the modeling is going to be hard in getting the model to match the physical world is going to be all it doe have to interact with the model .,technology
yeah yeah but it is you look at even the simplest problem if they talk about the three body problem or simple chaotic prediction or predicting the economy .,technology
it is hard to predict the economy two year out .,technology
maybe the case is normal human can predict whats going to happen in the economy next quarter .,technology
they can not do that .,technology
maybe a ai system thats a zillion time smarter can only predict it out a year or something .,technology
instead of you have these exponential increase in computer intelligence for linear increase in in in ability to predict .,technology
same with again biological molecule molecule interacting you do not know whats going to happen when you perturb but when you perturb a complex system you can find simple part in it .,technology
if you are smarter you are better at finding these simple part .,technology
and then i think human institution human institution are are difficult .,technology
i will not give specific example but it is been hard to get people to adopt even the technology that weve developed even one where the case for their efficacy is very very strong .,technology
people have concern .,technology
they think thing are conspiracy theory .,technology
it is also been very difficult to get very simple thing through the regulatory system. ?,technology
i think and i do not want to disparage anyone who work in regulatory regulatory system of any technology .,technology
they are hard tradeoff .,technology
they have to deal with .,technology
they have to save life .,technology
but but the system a a whole i think make some obvious tradeoff that are very far from maximizing human welfare .,technology
and if we bring ai system into this into these human system often the level of intelligence may not be the limiting factor. ?,technology
it it may be that it take a long time to do something .,technology
now if the ai system circumvented all government if it said i am dictator of the world and i am going to do whatever some of these thing that could do .,technology
again the thing have you do with complexity .,technology
i still think a lot of thing would take a while .,technology
i do not think it help that the ai system can produce a lot of energy or go to the moon some people in comment responded to the essay saying the ai system can produce a lot of energy and smarter ai system .,technology
thats missing the point .,technology
that cycle doesnt solve the key problem that i am talking about here .,technology
i think i think a bunch of people miss the point there .,technology
but even if it were completely online and could get around all these human obstacle that would have trouble .,technology
but again if you want this to be an ai system that doesnt take over the world that doesnt destroy humanity then it is going to need to follow basic human laws. ?,technology
if we want to have an good world we are going to have to have an ai system that interacts with human not one that creates it own legal system or disregard all the law or all of that .,technology
a inefficient a these process are we are going to have to deal with them because there need to be some popular and democratic legitimacy in how these system are rolled out .,technology
we can not have a small group of people who are developing these system say this is whats best for everyone. ?,technology
i think it is wrong and i think in practice is not going to work anyway .,technology
you put all those thing together and we are not going to change the world and upload everyone in five minute .,technology
i i do not think ai ai i do not think it is going to happen and be to to the extent that it could happen it is it is not the way to lead to a good world .,technology
thats on one side .,technology
on the other side there another set of perspective which i have in some way more sympathy for which is look weve seen big productivity increase before ?,technology
economist are familiar with studying the productivity increase that came from the computer revolution and internet revolution and generally those productivity increase were underwhelming .,technology
they were le than you then you might imagine .,technology
there wa a quote from robert solo the computer revolution everywhere except the productivity statistic .,technology
why is this the case ?,technology
people point to the structure of firm the structure of enterprise how how slow it is been to roll out or existing technology to very poor part of the world which i talk about in the essay ?,technology
how do we get these technology to the poorest part of the world that are behind on cell phone technology computer medicine let alone new fangle day eye that hasnt been invented yet .,technology
you could have a perspective thats this is amazing technically but it is all enough in burger .,technology
i think tyler cowen who wrote something response to my essay ha that perspective .,technology
i think he think the radical change will happen eventually but he think itll take fifty or one hundred year .,technology
and you could have even more static perspective on the whole thing .,technology
i think there some truth to it .,technology
i think the time scale is too long .,technology
and i can see it .,technology
i can see both side with today ai .,technology
a lot of our customer are large enterprise who are used to doing thing a certain way .,technology
ive also seen it in talking to government ?,technology
those are those are prototypical institution entity that are slow to change .,technology
but the dynamic i see over and over again is yes it take a long time to move the ship .,technology
you find two thing that move thing forward .,technology
one you find a small fraction of people within a company within a government who see the big picture who see the whole scaling hypothesis who understand where ai is going or at least understand where it is going within their industry .,technology
and there are a few people that within the current within the current u government who see the whole picture .,technology
and and those people see that this is the most important thing in the world until they agitate for it .,technology
and the thing that they alone are not enough to succeed because they are a small set of people within a large organization .,technology
but a the technology start to roll out a it succeeds in some place in the folk who are most willing to adopt it the specter of competition give them a wind at their back because they can point within their large organization .,technology
they can say look these other guy are doing this ?,technology
one bank can say look this newfangled hedge fund is doing this thing .,technology
they are going to eat our lunch .,technology
in the u we can say we are afraid china going to get there before we are .,technology
and that combination the specter of competition plus a few visionary within these within these the organization that in many way are are sclerotic you put those two thing together and it make something happen .,technology
it is interesting .,technology
it is a balance fight between the two because inertia is very powerful .,technology
but but but eventually over enough time the innovative approach break through .,technology
and ive seen that happen .,technology
ive seen the arc of that over and over again .,technology
and it is the barrier are there .,technology
the barrier to progress the complexity not knowing how to use the model how to deploy them are there .,technology
and for a bit it seems they are going to last forever .,technology
but then eventually change happens and always come from a few people .,technology
i felt the same way when i wa an advocate of the scaling hypothesis within the ai field itself and others did not get it .,technology
it felt then it felt we had a secret almost no one ever had .,technology
and then a couple year later everyone ha the secret .,technology
and i think thats how it is going to go with deployment to ai in the world .,technology
it is going to the barrier are going to fall apart gradually and then all at once .,technology
and i think this is going to be more .,technology
and this is an instinct .,technology
i could easily see how i am wrong .,technology
i think it is going to be more ten five or ten year a i say in the essay then it is going to be fifty or one hundred year .,technology
i also think it is going to be five or ten year more than it is going to be five or ten hour .,technology
and i think a lot of these people who write down me differential equation who say ai is going to make more powerful ai who can not understand how it could possibly be the case that these thing will not change fast .,technology
i think they do not understand these thing .,technology
what do you use the timeline to where we achieve agi aka powerful ai aka super useful ai ?,technology
i am going to start calling with that .,technology
it is a debate about naming .,technology
on pure intelligence it can smarter than a nobel prize winner and every relevant discipline and all the thing weve said .,technology
modality can go and do stuff on it own for day week and do biology experiment on it own .,technology
let tick to biology .,technology
because yeah i would use sold me on the whole biology and health section .,technology
it is exciting from i wa getting getting from a scientific perspective and maybe you want to be a biologist .,technology
no no this wa the feeling i have when i wa writing it that it is this would be such a beautiful future .,technology
if we can if we can if we can make it happen ?,technology
a much a we fight about about all these political question is is this something that could bring u together ?,technology
but you were asking when when when when when do you think whats but number on this ?,technology
this this is of course the thing ive been grappling with for many year and i am not i am not at all confident .,technology
whoevers ex these clip will will will will crop out the thing i said and and and only say the thing i am about to say but ill say it anyway .,technology
thats fine .,technology
if you extrapolate the curve that weve had far ?,technology
if if you say i do not know we are starting to get to phd level and and last year we were at under graduate level and the year before we were at the level of a high school student .,technology
again you can you can you can quibble with at what task and for what we are still missing modality but those are being added .,technology
computer use wa added .,technology
if you and this is unscientific but if you eyeball the rate at which these capability are increasing it doe make you think that well get there by two thousand and twenty six or two thousand and twenty seven .,technology
again lot of thing could derail it .,technology
we could run out of data .,technology
we might not be able to scale cluster a much a we want .,technology
maybe taiwan get blown up or something and then we can not produce a many gpus a we want .,technology
there are there are all kind of thing that could derail the whole process .,technology
i do not fully believe the straight line extrapolation but if you believe the straight line extrapolation youll youll well get there in two thousand and twenty six or two thousand and twenty seven .,technology
i think the most likely is that there some mild delay relative to that .,technology
i do not know what that delay is but i think it could happen on schedule .,technology
i think there could be a mild delay .,technology
i think there are still world where it doesnt happen in a hundred year .,technology
those world the number of those world is rapidly decreasing .,technology
we are rapidly running out of truly convincing brocclers truly compelling reason why this will not happen in the next few year .,technology
there were a lot more in two thousand and twenty .,technology
although my my guess my hunch at that time wa that well make it through all those blocker .,technology
people call them scaling law .,technology
thats a misnomer .,technology
moore law is is is a misnomer .,technology
they are not law of the universe .,technology
they are empirical regularity .,technology
i am going to bat in favor of them continuing but i am not certain of that .,technology
you extensively describe the compressed 21st century how agi will help set forth a chain of breakthrough in biology and medicine that help u in all these kind of way that i mentioned .,technology
how do you think what are the early step in my due ?,technology
and by the way ask claude good question to ask you about the and claude told me task would you think is a typical day for biologist working on agi look under in this future ?,technology
a lot is curious .,technology
let me let me start with your first question and then ill answer that .,technology
claude want to know whats in it future ?,technology
who might get it be working with ?,technology
i think one of the thing i went hard on and when i went hard on in the essay is let me go back to this idea of because it is had it had an impact on me .,technology
this idea that within large organization and system they are end up being a few people or a few new idea who cause thing to go in a different direction they would have before who disproportionately affect the trajectory .,technology
there a bunch of the same thing going on ?,technology
if you think about the health world there trillion of dollar to pay out medicare and other health insurance and then the nih is one hundred billion .,technology
and then if i think of the few thing that have revolutionized anything it could be encapsulated in a small small fraction of that .,technology
and when i think of where will ai have an impact ?,technology
i am can ai turn that small fraction into a much larger fraction and raise it quality ?,technology
and within biology my experience within biology is that the biggest problem of biology is that you can not see whats going on .,technology
you have very little ability to see whats going on and even le ability to change it ?,technology
what you have is this from this you have to infer that there a bunch of cell that within each cell is a three billion base pair of dna built according to a genetic code .,technology
and there are all these process that are going on without any ability of u a unogmented human to affect it .,technology
these cell are dividing most of the time thats healthy but sometimes that process go wrong and thats cancer .,technology
the cell are aging .,technology
your skin may change color develop wrinkle a you a you age .,technology
and all of this is determined by these process .,technology
all these protein being produced transported to various part of the cell binding to each other .,technology
and in our initial state about biology we did not even know that these cell existed .,technology
we had to invent microscope to observe the cell .,technology
we had to we had to invent more powerful microscope to see below the level of the cell the level of molecule .,technology
we had to invent xray crystal logography to see the dna .,technology
we had to invent gene sequencing to read the dna .,technology
now we had to invent proteinfolding technology to to predict how it would fold and how they find how these thing bind to each other .,technology
we had to we had to invent various technique for now .,technology
we can edit the dna a of with crispr a of the last twelve year .,technology
the whole history of biology a whole big part of the history is our ability to read and understand whats going on and our ability to reach in and selectively change thing .,technology
and my view is that there much more we can still do there ?,technology
you can do crispr but you can do it for your whole body .,technology
let say i want to do it for one particular type of cell and i want the rate of targeting the wrong cell to be very low .,technology
thats still a challenge .,technology
thats still thing people are working on .,technology
thats what we might need for gene therapy for certain disease .,technology
and the reason i am saying all of this and it go beyond beyond this to to gene sequencing to new type of nano material for observing whats going on inside cell for antibody drug conjugate .,technology
the reason i am saying all of this is that this could be a leverage point for the ai system ?,technology
that the number of such invention it is in the mid double digit or something mid double digit maybe low triple digit over the history of biology .,technology
let say i have a million of these ai can they discover a thousand working together can they discover thousand of these very quickly ?,technology
and doe that provide a huge lever instead of trying to leverage the two trillion a year we spend on medicare or whatever can we leverage the one billion a year thats thats spent to discover but with much higher quality .,technology
and what what is it being a scientist that work with with an ai system the way i think about it is i think in the early stage the ai are going to be grad student .,technology
you are going to give them a project .,technology
you are going to say i am the experienced biologist .,technology
ive set up the lab the biology professor or even the grad student themselves well say here what here what you can do with an ai ai system .,technology
id to study this and the ai system it ha all the tool .,technology
it can look up all the literature to decide what to do .,technology
it can look at all the equipment .,technology
it can go to a website and say hey i am going to go to thermofisher or whatever the lab equipment company is the lab equipment company is today and my my time wa thermofisher .,technology
i am i am going to order this new equipment to do this .,technology
i am going to run my experiment .,technology
i am going to write up a report about my experiment .,technology
i am going to inspect the image for contamination .,technology
i am going to decide what the next experiment is .,technology
i am going to write some code and run a statistical analysis .,technology
all the thing that grad student would do that will be a computer with an ai that the professor talk to everyones to while and it say is what you are going to do today .,technology
the ai system come to it with question .,technology
when it is necessary to run the lab equipment it may be limited in some way .,technology
and itll look there a human professor in a thousand ai grad student and if you if you go to one of these nobel prize winning biologist or youll say you had fifty grad student .,technology
now you have a thousand and they are smarter than you are by the way .,technology
then i think at some point itll flip around where the the ai system will will be the pi will be the leader and and theyll be theyll be ordering human or other ai system around .,technology
i think thats how itll work on the research side and they would be the inventor of a crispr type technique .,technology
they would be the inventor of a crispr type technology .,technology
can we get better at statistical design that what clinical trial that used to require fivezero people and therefore needed one hundred million in the year to enroll them .,technology
now they need five hundred people and two month to enroll them .,technology
thats where we should start .,technology
i do not know that would be my picture doing an in vitro and doing it .,technology
you still slow down it still take time but you can do much much faster .,technology
and when you add up all those positive direction do you get everything that wa going to happen from here to two thousand one hundred instead of happens from two thousand and twenty seven to two thousand and thirty two or something ?,technology
another way that i think the world might be changing with ai even today but moving towards this future of the the powerful super useful ai is programming .,technology
how do the nature of programming because it is intimate to the actual act of building ai ?,technology
how do that changing for u human ?,technology
i think thats going to be one of the area that change fastest for two reason .,technology
one programming is a skill thats very close to the actual building of the ai .,technology
the farther a skill is from the people who are building the ai the longer it is going to take to get disrupted by the ai ?,technology
i truly believe that ai will disrupt agriculture .,technology
maybe it already ha in some way but thats very distant from the folk who are building ai and i think it is going to take longer .,technology
but programming is the bread and butter of a large fraction of employee who work at anthropic and at the other company .,technology
and it is going to happen fast .,technology
the other reason it is going to happen fast is with programming you close the loop .,technology
both when you are trained in the model when you are applying the model the idea that the model can write the code mean that the model can then run the code and then see the result and interpret it back .,technology
and it ha a ability unlike hardware unlike biology which we discussed .,technology
the model ha an ability to close the loop .,technology
and i think those two thing are going to lead to the model getting good at programming very fast .,technology
a i saw on typical realworld programming model have gone from three in january of this year to fifty in october of this year .,technology
we are on that s curve ?,technology
we are going to start slowing down soon because you can only get to one hundred .,technology
but i would guess that in another ten month well probably get pretty close .,technology
well be at at least ninety .,technology
i would guess that the task that the vast majority of coder do ai can probably if we make the task very narrow code ai system will be able to do that .,technology
now that said i think compared to advantage is powerful .,technology
well find that when ai can do eighty of a coder job including most of it thats code with a given spec well find that the remaining part of the job become more leveraged for human ?,technology
human will therell be more about highlevel system design or looking at the app and is it architected and the design and ux aspect ?,technology
and eventually ai will be able to do those a ?,technology
thats my vision of the powerful ai system .,technology
but i think for much longer than we might expect we will see that small part of the job that human still do will expand to fill their entire job in order for the overall productivity to go up .,technology
thats something weve seen .,technology
it used to be that writing writing writing and editing letter wa very difficult and writing the print wa difficult .,technology
a soon a you had word processor and then and then computer and it became easy to produce work and easy to share it then that became instance and all the focus wa on the idea .,technology
this this logic of comparative advantage that expands tiny part of the task to large part of the task and creates new task in order to expand productivity .,technology
i think thats going to be the case .,technology
again someday ai will be better at everything and that logic will not apply and then then we all have humanity will have to think about how to collectively deal with that and we are thinking about that every day .,technology
and thats another one of the grand problem to deal with aside from misuse and autonomy and we should take it very .,technology
itll be le writing thing line by line and itll be more macroscopic .,technology
and i want to with the future of idea look the tooling of interacting with the assistant .,technology
and dropping itself you can not say no it is hard to say what will happen in the future .,technology
currently we are not trying to make such idea or self rather we are powering the company cursor or cognition or some of the other exboh in the security space others that i can mention a that are building such thing themselves on top of our api .,technology
and our view ha been let a thousand flower bloom .,technology
we do not internally have the the resource to trial these different thing .,technology
and well see who succeed and maybe different customer will succeed in different way .,technology
i i i both think this is super promising and it is not it is not it is not something anthropic is not is not eager to at least now compete with all our company in this space and maybe never .,technology
yeah it is been interesting to watch cursor trading a great class successfully because it is been fascinating how many place it can help the program experience .,technology
it is not a trivial .,technology
it is it is astounding .,technology
i feel a a ceo i do not get to program that much and i feel if six month from now i go back itll be completely unrecognizable to me exactly .,technology
in this world wa super powerfully i thats increasingly automated .,technology
whats the source of meaning for u human ?,technology
work is a source of deep meaning for many of u . what do we where do we find the meaning ?,technology
this is something that ive written about a little bit in the essay although i i i give it a bit shorttripped not for any not for any principal reason but this essay if you believe it wa originally going to be two or three page .,technology
i wa going to talk about it at all hand and the reason i i realized it wa an important underexport topic is that i kept writing thing and i wa man i can not do this justice .,technology
and the thing ballooned to forty or fifty page and then when i got to the work and mean section i am man this is not going to be one hundred page .,technology
i am going to have to write a whole lot of the rest say about that .,technology
doe that rob you of the meaning of the whole thing ?,technology
i still made important choice including moral choice .,technology
i still sacrifice i still had to gain all these skill or or a similar exercise think back to one of the historical figure who discovered electromagnetism or relativity or something .,technology
if you told them twentyzero year ago some alien on some alien on this planet discovered this before you did .,technology
doe that rob the meaning of the discovery ?,technology
it seems the process is what matter and how it show who you are a a person along the way and how you relate to other people and the decision that you make along the way those are those were consequential .,technology
i i could imagine if we handle thing badly in the day i world we could set thing up where people do not have any longterm source of meaning or any but thats thats more a choice a set of choice we make .,technology
thats more a set of the architecture of a society with these powerful model .,technology
if we if we design it badly and for shallow thing then that might happen .,technology
assuming we can distribute the benefit of these technology of this technology to everywhere their life are going to get a hell of a lot better .,technology
i i am optimistic about meaning .,technology
i worry about economics and the concentration of power .,technology
thats what i worry about more .,technology
i worry about how do we make sure that that fair world reach everyone ?,technology
when thing have gone wrong for human theyve often gone wrong because human mistreat other human .,technology
that is maybe in some way even more than the autonomous risk of ai or the question of meaning .,technology
that that is the thing i worry about most .,technology
the the concentration of power the abuse of power structure autocracy and dictatorship where a small number of people exploit a large number of people .,technology
i am very worried about that .,technology
and ai increase the amount of power in the world .,technology
and if you concentrate that power and abuse that power it can do immeasurable damage .,technology
yes it is very frightening .,technology
it is very it is very i encourage people highly encouraged people to read the full essay .,technology
that should probably be a book or a sequence of essay because it doe paint a very specific future .,technology
i could tell the later section got shorter and shorter because you started to probably realize that this is going to be a very long essay .,technology
i very much tried to avoid that but i have to admit once i got the biology section i wasnt an expert .,technology
and a much a i expressed uncertainty probably i said some a bunch of thing that were embarrassing or wrong .,technology
i wa excited for the future you painted and thank you much for working hard to build that future and thank you for talking thanks for having me .,technology
i i hope we can get it and make it real and if there one message i want to i want to send it is that to get all this stuff to make it real .,technology
we we both need to build the technology build the the company the economy around using this technology positively but we also need to address the risk because they are those risk are in our way .,technology
they are they are landmines on on the way from here to there and we have to diffuse those landmines if we want to get there .,technology
it is a balance all thing in life .,technology
all thing .,technology
thanks for listening to this conversation with daria amadeh and now dear friend here amanda askle .,technology
you are a philosopher by training .,technology
what question did you find fascinating through your journey in philosophy in oxford and nyu and then switching over to the ai problem at openai and anthropoc .,technology
i think philosophy is a good subject if you are fascinated with everything .,technology
because there a philosophy of everything .,technology
if you do philosophy of mathematics for a while and then you decide that you are interested in chemistry you can do philosophy of chemistry for a while you can move into ethic or philosophy of politics .,technology
i think towards the end i wa interested in ethic primarily .,technology
that wa what my phd wa on .,technology
it wa on a technical area of ethic which wa ethic where world contain infinitely many people strangely .,technology
a little bit le practical on the end of ethic .,technology
it is probably one of the most fascinating question ive ever encountered in philosophy and i love it .,technology
but i would rather see if i can have an impact on the world and see if i can do good thing .,technology
and i think that wa around the time that ai wa still probably not a widely recognized a it is now .,technology
that wa around two thousand and seventeen two thousand and eighteen .,technology
and what is ai policy in tail ?,technology
at the time this wa more thinking about the political impact and the ramification of ai and then i slowly moved into ai evaluation how we evaluate model how they compare with human output whether people can tell the difference between ai and human output .,technology
and then when i joined on throphic i wa more interested in doing technical alignment work and again seeing if i could do it and then being if i can not then thats fine i tried the way i lead life i think .,technology
what wa that taking a leap from the philosophy of everything into the technical ?,technology
i think that sometimes people do this thing that i am not that keen on where there will be is this person technical or not ?,technology
you are either a person who can code and is not scared of math or you are not .,technology
and i think maybe more i think a lot of people are very capable of working these kind of area if they try it .,technology
and i did find it that bad .,technology
politics is messy and it is harder to find solution to problem in the space of politics definitive clear provable beautiful solution a you can with technical problem .,technology
it is also funny if people think about the slack channel because i am thats one of five or six different method that i have for talking with clothes and i am yes this is a tiny percentage of how much i talk with clothes .,technology
do you also have to figure out when clawed should push back on an idea or argue versus you have to respect the world view of the person that arrives to clawed but also maybe help them grow if needed a a tricky balance .,technology
yeah there this problem of sick of incy in language model .,technology
can you describe that ?,technology
what are their trait you already mentioned a bunch but what are their that come to mind that are good in this or a satinian sense for conversation to have ?,technology
yeah i think there one that are good for conversational purpose asking follow question in the appropriate place and i am asking the appropriate kind of question .,technology
yeah your task is how to probe with question .,technology
yeah and you are exploring the long tail the edge the edge case or are you looking for general behavior ?,technology
i think it is almost everything i because i want a film app of the model i am trying to do the whole spectrum of possible interaction you could have with it .,technology
i may be i guess ask question why or what other detail can i provide to help you answer better ?,technology
yeah is that work or no ?,technology
yeah ive done this with the model it doesnt always work but sometimes ill be why did you do that ?,technology
people underestimate the decrease which you can interact with with model yeah i am and something thats usually quote word for word the part that made you and you do not know that it is fully accurate but sometimes you do that and then you change a thing .,technology
how do you get signal feedback about the human experience across thousand thats a thought hundred of thousand of people what their pain point are what feel good .,technology
are you using your own intuition a you talk to it to see what are the pain point ?,technology
there would be a special touring test moment where clothes say i need a break for an hour and it sound you do too and leave clothes of the window .,technology
yeah it is the inspired me to add that to the user prompt .,technology
to move you her do you think will be headed there one day where human have romantic relationship with ai system in this case it is text and voicebased .,technology
i think that we are going to have to navigate a hard question of relationship with ai especially if they can remember thing about your past interaction with them .,technology
i am of many mind about this because i think the reflexive reaction is to be this is very bad and we should prohibit it in some way .,technology
i think it is a thing that ha to be handled with extreme care for many reason one is this is a for example a few of the model changing this you probably do not want people performing longterm attachment to something that might change with the next iteration .,technology
there a way in which i could see it being healthy and helpful .,technology
it is a case where it is if you imagine i the idea of the model say knowing roughly how they were trained and and i think cold will often do this .,technology
for there are thing part of the trait training included what clothes should do if people explaining the limitation of the relationship between any eye and a human that it doesnt retain thing from the conversation .,technology
andthropic may be the very company to develop a system that we definitively recognize a a gi and you very might be the person that talk to it .,technology
probably talk to it first .,technology
what would the conversation contain what would be your first question ?,technology
it depends partly on the capability level of the model .,technology
in many way i am i can then have useful conversation with it .,technology
if i am working on something a part of my research i can be which i already find myself starting to do if i am i feel there this thing in virtue ethic and i can not quite remember the term ill use the model for thing that .,technology
but what if it is two time the smartest human on earth on that particular discipline ?,technology
yeah i guess you are good at probing cloud in a way that push it limit .,technology
understand any more the limit are .,technology
i guess what would be a question you would ask to be yep this is agi ?,technology
thats hard because it feel in order to it ha to be a series of question if there wa one question you can train anything to answer one question extremely .,technology
if id you can probably train at time for twenty question extremely .,technology
how long would you need to be locked in a room with an agi to know this thing is agi ?,technology
i think thing that i can probe the edge of human knowledge of i think this with philosophy a little bit .,technology
maybe thats the thing where i am ive thought of a cool novel argument in this niche and i am going to probe you to see if you can come up with it and how much prompting it take to get you to come up with it .,technology
and i think for some of these at the edge of human knowledge question i am you could not in fact come up with the thing i came up with .,technology
i think people over estimate that novelty is not it is completely different from anything thats ever happened thats this is it can be a variant of thing that have happened and still be novel .,technology
but i think yeah if i saw the the more i were to see completely a novel work from the model that that would be and this is going to feel iterative .,technology
one of those thing where there never it is people i think want there to be a moment and i am i do not know i think that there might never be a moment it might be that there this continuous ramping up .,technology
i have a sense that there will be thing that a model can say that convinces you this is very it is not ive talked to people who are truly wise there you can tell there a lot of horsepower there .,technology
maybe in a way that the universe is much better off than we are in it and then we should definitely survive and spread throughout the universe .,technology
yes interesting because i think people focus much on intelligence especially with model .,technology
what are possible next exciting direction to you in this space of mechanism ?,technology
yeah youve youve written about this is oregon question .,technology
yeah exactly if we think of interpretability a a anatomy of neural network most of the circus threat wallstudying tiny little vein looking at the small scale in an individual neuron and how they connect .,technology
i suppose to nearby algae a psychologist or psychiatrist or some a neural network and i think that the beautiful thing would be if we could go and rather than having disparate field for those two thing if you could have a build a bridge between them .,technology
all such that you could go and have all of your higher obstruction be grounded very formally in this very solid more rigorous ideally foundation .,technology
what do you think is a difference between the human brain the biological neural network and the artificial neural network ?,technology
you can go and oblate neuron you can edit the connection and on and then you can undo those change thats pretty great .,technology
yeah you can force any you can intervene on any neuron and force an active and see what happens which neuron are connected to everything you have neuroscience ha one to connect and we have the connectome and we have it for much bigger than the elegans .,technology
hey everyone welcome back to the fourfourthree security simplified .,technology
i am your host mark the liberty and joining me today is cory it is a beautiful day in the neighborhood not cry a corys suggesting on today episode there nothing bad going on in the world and everything is fine .,technology
business a usual .,technology
thats my own dissolution going on now .,technology
i had to throw a little bit of licensing shade that is fair .,technology
thats said if we are drawing an apple to apple comparison this is probably more similar to the watch guard management server which memory service did need license five i think i think you get five .,technology
you got a free for thrive .,technology
yeah anyways watch guard cloud what you should be using clearly .,technology
i thought thats interesting .,technology
long after cyclops blink even after we transparently talked about that dan had issue with they claimed we werent transparent about it ultimately because we released a cv for it later and we do not believe thats the case .,technology
we detailed the vulnerability we warned people to get the patch .,technology
we werent trying to hide any vulnerability i admit we we later on agree that we want to follow a cv process for every single customer any vulnerability that requires customer action ?,technology
there might be more to the story we do not know that said i do have to admit it is it is interesting .,technology
that aside keep going on this mark it is interesting that i i can think of it for two way .,technology
they are because it clearly did tip people off humorous yeah there a reddit thread .,technology
i do you accept the nda by reading release note anyways correct .,technology
yeah thats but they have since by the way they have since given an official piece or reply .,technology
if you are a customer and are curious make sure to go check that one out i think my main takeaway from this is a much a security vendor want to be a transparent a possible a much a software vendor want to be a transparent a possible .,technology
i think thats the most important part of transparency that youve fixed it that you are taking action and that you are doing something different .,technology
i think that build trust maybe one day well find out why it took long to get an official patch out for something that wa being exploited but interesting story for sure which we knew more about the nuance .,technology
i guess well find out .,technology
dan will good and release any more article it is possible .,technology
i still use it a a relevant and timely thing i think in my brain it is somewhere within the last two or three year five year .,technology
weve always had security in our cio department but making it a standalone thing wa in part because of targeting of it and security company .,technology
i can not believe it is been five year five year .,technology
they were hacked because they used a solar wind product that wa insecure and got trojanized now they are they are ready the issue with supply chain issue is you have to pay for someone el security mistake but now they have to pay fine on top of it .,technology
granted it is for maybe i would argue they depending on the detail in these case .,technology
yes you could be if you were affected by this you should have told your customer but it make it ironic even more and slam home how much supply chain attack can harm those thirdparty company ?,technology
it is one that got trojanized that had nothing to do with you what ?,technology
that doesnt necessarily mean within four day of the event happening it is once youve determined it might seem material meaning it could impact your share shareholder or someone willingness to invest in the company .,technology
thats the criterion for material then you have four day to file that which is pretty short but that said there way to extend that if you work with the doj .,technology
i find it a little i understand but i find it a little funny that some of the strictest requirement come from not protecting people or customer but from protecting shareholder that it feel absolutely american .,technology
it all come down to money .,technology
i think you said you did the calculation .,technology
yeah absolutely insane scale on that one .,technology
yeah absolutely nut .,technology
yeah no doom stay for once be transparent and be good neighbor we should have mr. roger come out .,technology
i should take off my sweater and leave the house now to some nice calming music i missed that guy and the world wa a little bit better when it wa much night .,technology
i would vote for him hey something tell me he would never run for anything in this political .,technology
no he know better he ha better way to affect the world .,technology
we miss you mr. rogers hey everyone thanks again for listening a always if you enjoyed today episode do not forget to rate review and subscribe if you have any question on today topic or suggestion for future episode episode topic you can keep them to yourselves .,technology
i would be impressed if my phone could focus that far but if one of you figure that out hat off to you thanks again for listening and you will hear from u next week you,technology
you can see from short distance away with your naked human eye thats some of them appear to be very precise .,technology
and then polish to a level precision that it hears to potentially the machining itself .,technology
if these were cut or carved and then polished they look ultraprecise and to a normal person some of them look almost perfect .,technology
the pervidence or when exactly these thing were originally found we do not know .,technology
this one is attributed to nikata .,technology
it is considered to be nikata based .,technology
and i got that one with the college of beaford the egyptian college of started .,technology
these look special .,technology
they do not seem to be made by the people that they are ascribed to .,technology
those people do not seem to have had the technology to do them .,technology
there no evidence of that .,technology
they seem to be in possession of them however .,technology
and is there a way we can take a look at these object to see if there any information we can extract from them .,technology
but when i thought i had a few that seemed they were i had one of them scanned by a representative of a defense industry contractor .,technology
a plate is then cut and parallel with the ground .,technology
these are different plane we sliced .,technology
we sliced and we created an artificial plane .,technology
looked at all the point along that particular plane .,technology
calcutta is standard deviation of each point from that prefix circle .,technology
that computer dropped generates and say if they were going for a perfect circle how close do they get ?,technology
how good is this relative ?,technology
and here we can see the interior next area .,technology
we are almost to see .,technology
to about the scene .,technology
now every point a little bit different .,technology
this is twelve micron .,technology
this is sixteen micron .,technology
these point are probably an inch apart .,technology
but two centimeter apart from each other .,technology
yeah sixteen micron is zero.sixteen millimeter .,technology
thats fine and sane .,technology
hi everyone .,technology
thanks for tuning in .,technology
if you are enjoying the show and want to support me there are a few way you can help .,technology
by becoming a patreon member you will get access to discord exclusive content and behind the scene update on my research .,technology
for instance i recently traveled to london to scan predynastic way at the petium museum .,technology
your support make that possible .,technology
search for ancient technology on patreon or check the link in the description for all donation option .,technology
your support not only keep the podcast going but also fund the research behind it .,technology
covering cost equipment and travel .,technology
thanks again for being here and i am excited to keep bringing you more great content and discovery .,technology
but now let jump back to the show .,technology
thank you .,technology
we are flying to london today .,technology
yes we are .,technology
the petium museum .,technology
we will have some project to do there .,technology
but i wanted to sit down with you to talk about ancient precision way .,technology
it is hard stone way .,technology
and your entire journey with this project and this topic started .,technology
when did you do you realize these thing are interesting ?,technology
how did it start ?,technology
this wa shown to me and explained to me by archaeologist both professionally and amateur in egypt .,technology
i saw these firsthand ten year ago or more .,technology
i had heard from local via being in the museum and seeing these piece on display .,technology
back down there were at that many of them and it wasnt regarded a something thats special .,technology
but there are people that are always war people that were talking about these .,technology
i think this had gone back to the age of petrie in the late 1800s and beyond .,technology
but guide in egypt muhammad ibrahim yusuf ouyran and then what i met robert schak dr. robert schak a bos in university .,technology
they mentioned thing about these day .,technology
and even over the chuck dr. robert schak .,technology
he too .,technology
i thought he moving on a completely different he is .,technology
but he a geologist .,technology
and any object thats made in stone is going to be adventurous to him especially if you recognize the type of stil with igneous rocket .,technology
it is something that he studied for many year .,technology
and the common theme were that there are these object in egypt other than the pyramid and the great monumental work of construction that are of interest a . however their museum we do not know where they are .,technology
no one ever studied and randomized .,technology
after being in egypt in the city when i returned home back to the state my wife and i started looking for these object my thought wa if no one else ha analyzed them thats interesting .,technology
if they are hard to find thats interesting .,technology
but turn out they were all that hard to find and you could find these online for sale via various auction house and heart broker antiquity dealer would commonly have these thing listed on their website for sale because they werent that popular .,technology
they werent that common .,technology
they werent that expensive .,technology
see they werent that rare .,technology
they were common .,technology
they were common and they werent that expensive for a long period of time .,technology
and i thought at the very least this is a piece of potentially prehistoric or prediynastic history would be very cool to own a piece of that but not i am not driven by i am not a collector i am not a hoarder necessarily .,technology
but i thought it is some point to be nice to have enough of these and do some actual real work or collaborate with others that could .,technology
and after finding a few of them i had i had many of them but they are not all all high interest .,technology
they are not all of of high quality or accurate to what we are going to talk about today .,technology
but when i thought i had a few that seemed they were i had one of them scanned by a representative of a defense industry contractor that wa demoing demonstrating and also selling structured lightskating device .,technology
representative of gold which is now owned by zice but it used to be an independent company .,technology
they made a number of skater .,technology
it is calculating the point and how these stand they are from the cameras. . and it take all those data point .,technology
it put them into it own internal threedimensional coordinate a a matter of a touch of some other metric a . and that file can be exported a a common file that you can then read into a variety of program .,technology
there proprietary program that correspond to some of the different piece of electronics .,technology
each company might make the real proprietary system .,technology
but then you can also use free version blender .,technology
it is an open source system .,technology
you can create custom scripting to make your work in your alices faster .,technology
but there different way you can analyze the threedimensional coordinate system once it is there. . you want it to be in threedimensional cartoon effectively space xyz play .,technology
which allows you to measure distance to look at threedimensional geometry .,technology
how round is this round feature ?,technology
it look round but is it round ?,technology
how round is it relative to a perfect circle or a sphere or a cylinder ?,technology
how flat is something ?,technology
whats the deviation in his elevation or lipid ?,technology
what wa interesting about these phase ?,technology
it should capture your attention .,technology
you can see from short distance away with your naked human thats some of them appear to be very precise .,technology
and then polish to a level precision that it hears to potentially the machining itself .,technology
these were cutter carved and then polished .,technology
they look ultraprecise and to a normal person .,technology
some of them look almost perfect .,technology
this look it wa machined .,technology
it came out of a machine shop off of a assembly line .,technology
some some operation that resulted in creating the level of precision .,technology
and they also do not correspond to other thing in museum .,technology
they look a lot different than the majority of thing found in any museum anywhere .,technology
from anything going back before let say at the sixteen or one thousand seven hundred .,technology
they stand out a being unique .,technology
clearly high level and then poultry .,technology
clearly a higher level than pottery .,technology
although some pottery doe look round some of it wa made in a pottery wheel .,technology
it is not finished to a level of accuracy that aligns with a geometric shape .,technology
this is your piece ?,technology
yeah this is one of them .,technology
and a lot of them were dated to a time before diagnostic egypt .,technology
dynastic egypt is what most historian and textbook would refer to a the first time in human history we had a number of thing .,technology
a written spoken built out language system of government system of process for doing everything from building to archiving trade to managing labor to taxation even financial contract .,technology
that stuff is a summary in an egyptian typically .,technology
and there not much else before that .,technology
we do not know what else before that .,technology
and what we do know and we have talking about roughly threezero bc .,technology
typically the the the the dynasty the early kingdom in egypt would have started around thirty two thirty three three thousand four hundred bc .,technology
sometimes it is referred to a the archaic period .,technology
but generally thats the formation of ancient egypt .,technology
and samaria is sometimes going back a little bit further .,technology
but generally thats the formation of human history a we know it .,technology
thats the thats when the recorded history for start and is preserved .,technology
we do not have human written history that go back before that any longer .,technology
it may be never wa there or it wasnt there for a period of time .,technology
these are dated by archaeologist and they are regarded to be older than the dynastic egypt .,technology
or early dynastic sometimes .,technology
sometimes into the first few dynasty yes .,technology
but a far back officially a four five thousand bc .,technology
and thats because of where they were found .,technology
a lot of you found in up and down egypt .,technology
we have upper egypt and lower egypt .,technology
petri wa excavating throughout the late 1800s .,technology
there are early 1900s .,technology
he excavated a lot of site .,technology
many other people did too .,technology
with egyptologist in there petri .,technology
if you are a human being european each turkeyologist ?,technology
he wa nothing .,technology
he wa english .,technology
but there wa other there wa there wa there french german austrian belgian .,technology
they were all over europe .,technology
they were in egypt .,technology
and doe the museum very early next week .,technology
thats his museum or a decolrectional fee finding .,technology
it sound a lot of the piece were brought back by him or others and then donated later .,technology
you have this concept of of victorian era archaeology .,technology
this wa it wa a new thing .,technology
it wa it wa a fascination by european .,technology
egypt wa a fascination. . a lot of thing were brought out of egypt and brought out of other country .,technology
we know about obelisk large thing that were stood up .,technology
and i live in new york .,technology
there one in new york .,technology
what probably the smallest one ?,technology
but it is still impressive .,technology
some of these are enormous .,technology
and they were successfully brought out of egypt legally or for lack of a better term .,technology
in accordance with the authority in egypt at the time .,technology
a lot of antiquity have been removed for egypt over the year .,technology
and petri his background wa in survey .,technology
he wa in a metrologist by trade but close enough he wa a survey .,technology
he wa a technical person .,technology
and he recognized how precise the workmanship the craftsmanship i guess is in egypt .,technology
he documented thing contour and elevation and metric with respect to pyramid and these bowl a . he wa everywhere in egypt .,technology
he wa the first archaeologist who started to look at thing from the technical perspective or engineering perspective .,technology
probably one of the first probably .,technology
and he did a good job of documenting his effort .,technology
not fire the use of photograph a much he would take some on occasion but he documented his effort up and down egypt .,technology
he credited with the communication the transparency of a lot of the information .,technology
others that followed it is footstep .,technology
i think a lot of time they regard it him a a one of the first great technical archaeologist in egypt these are college .,technology
what documentation do we have other than from him ?,technology
it hit it started in the i would say the lady to glendards baby mid but generally lady to glendards into the 1900s in today .,technology
the 1960s also there wa a lot of work done but in the earlier period you have to car on the step pyramid that that wa excavated for eighty to ninety year at least .,technology
and then whatever can be for that .,technology
thing that we are not documented that we are not official .,technology
in egypt you have a long history of antiquity collecting and for resell .,technology
and if you have longevity and your family history you can maybe afford to wage generation before that stuff is offloaded .,technology
i think i believe and i do not think this is controversial .,technology
that most of the antiquity in egypt most of the thing that or that you do not see we are not excavated or recovered through official mean .,technology
and they werent necessarily documented .,technology
it wasnt always theft because sometimes there were no law regarding this but you are not necessarily documenting everything if you are playing a they keep it for few generation itself .,technology
i think most of the archaeological record is on documented .,technology
since then is it probably able to bring out anything this from egypt ?,technology
now you can not bring very much out at all .,technology
i do not i am not positive but there are various treaty that the egyptian government put in place .,technology
depending on the type of material it is where it came from where it wa found you could export thing up to a certain date .,technology
custom of forcement agency all around the world see a antiquity object .,technology
i wa reading an article that someone had two hundred object in one back .,technology
and it wasnt by the egyptian custom it wa by a different i think european it might have been an inlear or some other country .,technology
and this stuff is still this stuff is still enforced .,technology
egypt doe make claim against certain artifact occasionally when something appears and they know about it it is been on the radar screen .,technology
we are mostly talking about statue we are talking about larger object sometimes smaller object .,technology
and i think now youll see create in other hard stone object that they are working on .,technology
but for a long time these were not regarded a particularly important partly because they were dated to before dinastic egypt .,technology
this came from a diplomatic collection .,technology
i believe it wa brought out .,technology
and i do not know exactly it wa a window the diplomat lived and worked in egypt from the 30 into the 40 . and i am not sure exactly what he brought it out .,technology
but there record of it there a trade myth there manifest that show that he brought it out and he ha documentation around it to avoid being accused of theft they aint late .,technology
thats the province .,technology
the providence or when exactly these thing were originally found we do not know .,technology
this one is attributed to nikata .,technology
it is considered to be in nikata day .,technology
nagada wa the culture before the egyptian culture started .,technology
that wa the precursor civilization but because of the culture .,technology
yeah one of them .,technology
there wa many culture .,technology
one of the yeah one of the closest one it wa predominantly an upper egypt .,technology
thats the region around luxor .,technology
if you are looking at a map of egypt it would be in between lower egypt which is a chirore area and then nubia .,technology
something in the middle .,technology
yeah this considered upper egypt .,technology
it occurs with a full of an island .,technology
and ill flow a north or down .,technology
lower egypt is north upper egypt is middle or south .,technology
and then the northern now whats stood in a lot of that wa this nubian region that then obuts or touch into upper egypt .,technology
nikata wa this culture that inhabited a series of site a series of area geography thats been several hundred mile .,technology
and there a number of different excavation site that were done and then attributed to the nikata culture .,technology
nikata a a culture i think is roughly maybe four thousand five hundred bc .,technology
i am not sure if it wa a early a fivezero bc but ive seen four thousand five hundred forty .,technology
i think in egypt in the nubian museum we have seen those artifact from the nikata culture dated back to around fourfive hundred or something .,technology
yeah the egg the nubian egg .,technology
yes that wa forty five ?,technology
something yeah forty five forty seven .,technology
i will look it up .,technology
yeah it is hard .,technology
i do not know if we can put a specific date on when that culture .,technology
if it wa carbon dated we could but i do not know which one or which grave wa carbonated at all .,technology
yeah neither do i. nikata culture they are famous for these clay or effectively baked river clay pottery .,technology
and they are painted in these design that recur there these recurring theme in their design the way they display hill and mountain and river .,technology
the bottom usually are black .,technology
sometimes a lot of the rock are black .,technology
they seem to resemble some of these stolen vessel .,technology
in the katopaterines i would consider an emulation or an imitation of what they may have thought wa in earlier form .,technology
and they are making pottery that in some case mimic the design of these of certain stone vessel recurring form we see in the stone vessel over and over again .,technology
they are seemingly imitating them and dramatically le precise material clay .,technology
and you can see it across the room you can see that the clay pot the top is not parallel with the ground .,technology
they do not seem to be whatever the intentional shape is .,technology
they do not seem to be perfect geometry .,technology
it wa that imitation i would say probably .,technology
now we have stone tool that are attributed to a lot of these culture and theyve found stone workshop archaeologist have found stone workshop and dated them through different mean back a far a several hundred of thousand bc .,technology
there stolen workshop that are i think widely accepted to be fifty to fifty fivezero .,technology
yes now i do not know how you would date a stolen workshop .,technology
but what by the stolen workshop is a building or a series of structure or building where a high volume of stone tool were seemingly made in one place .,technology
youll see if it wa a if they were flaking off piece of let say flint or another object that you may see remnant built up in a large quantity indicating a lot of these tool are made in one place .,technology
when you say workshop i think you mean an area where the tool are made .,technology
but these officially belongs to the polyolithic time ?,technology
it is not it is a very before the nagela culture .,technology
and all the red culture which we have .,technology
but yeah you could have a stone workshop thats thats used over many different year my many different culture .,technology
and the dating is going to be looking at their earliest date .,technology
it could be reused by many people .,technology
and this is egypt where then then the nile valley is regarded to be inhabited for hundred of thousand of year .,technology
there one river thats the lifeblood of this entire region .,technology
people all live around the river .,technology
it is only natural for many place to be reenhabited many time .,technology
back to your question i think i did not know these were seemingly of various quality and some of the quality were fantastic that the fire explanation .,technology
i did not know that i felt these are special and they seemed they were made by a different time and a different culture .,technology
i think the late antoni west started to talk about these u precise thing .,technology
jonathan he wasted he got a lot of his knowledge from schwaladulubits which which predates him by i think a hundred year .,technology
did you be told already ?,technology
i thought in about these .,technology
i believe there wa a number of people not a lot but a number of people had talked about these type of object .,technology
the precision weve seen this in the pyramid potentially moving back the age of the snake and other object for another megolithic building project several earlier than whats commonly accepted .,technology
and no one had attempted the analysis to refute or accept any of these proposition .,technology
that wa one i think that wa one thing that i guess ill take for that having a scan done and looking at some preliminary result .,technology
now i am not a metrologist let see a big round .,technology
i have a math background .,technology
i have higher education in mathematics it is a statistic i understand math theory and then statistical mathematical theory to some extent .,technology
i do not know a phd but the master is great it help .,technology
but i think the way i think about these thing is top down from an intuitive sense doe this story make sense from what we are seeing ?,technology
and if the answer is no thats thats intuitive nature for me stop and the actual analytics take over and then it is all these look special .,technology
they do not seem to be made by the people that they are ascribed to .,technology
those people do not seem to have had the technology to do them .,technology
there no evidence of that .,technology
they seem to be in possession of them however .,technology
and is there a way we can take a look at these object to see if there any information we can extract from .,technology
you may have from the beginning that those people had no tool which were i do not think thats a fact .,technology
i think thats the mainstream view is that primitive tool were used .,technology
and when i say primitive handle stone handle and potentially early type of metal in some case ?,technology
they had copper .,technology
bronze wa after nagada much later .,technology
that we think. . you be if if somebody making bronze and another culture come in and displaces that culture and it is never seen bronze before they would probably take every piece they could find or reuse them .,technology
we do not know i do not think we know exactly when the bronze age started or how far back people have ever used metal .,technology
but we can we can say when certain culture are using it widely and it wa widespread .,technology
i think i think the point here is i did not know exactly what i wa doing but we started i started seeing some result .,technology
the first scary did eighty nine year ago now showed some very basic metrology result .,technology
the circularity of a few component on that red red and it called the og phase .,technology
i scanned five or six object and that one wa the most precise bidegree .,technology
a few of the other one were but not to the same degree .,technology
and that scanner wa capable of accuracy up to the point up to the limit of the scale and capability we were finding .,technology
i wa proximatetee in what ?,technology
a few thousandth of an inch circularity state or deviation which wa i think the boundary limit of what that scan of what the scanning equipment wa capable of .,technology
after i met chris dunn and his son alex his son alex his metrologist and work in this field quite a bit .,technology
we involved a few other people that work alongside alex and we we tried to not only develop the type of analytics that we were doing type in term of the metric and the making big comparison but then also scan it a many other object a we can .,technology
we eventually used some ct scanning equipment or xray technology weve also used photogrammetry .,technology
it is grown from there which one wa the best and the most accurate .,technology
the ct scanning in term of the methodology .,technology
the ct scanning is by far because it is capturing hundred of time where data point .,technology
but there some problem that have some drawback with that .,technology
photogrammetry is developing quite rapidly .,technology
probably it is probably developing faster than the other .,technology
photogrammetry when you are taking picture and you are stitching those picture together and creating the threedimensional object based on the picture .,technology
thats why it is not that accurate .,technology
a laser structured light or ct. . both are using light ct using xray technology which is a different spectrum .,technology
but i think the point is that technology that ha continued to grow and develop and thanks to shining 3d and the combo scan .,technology
free scan combo .,technology
plus i think it is now at a point where it is more versatile than it used to be while maintaining that level of accuracy .,technology
we can bring a quickment to various site rather than having a break .,technology
the site to the equipment .,technology
i think it is enabling u to expand this into other medium not stone laser .,technology
thats stay choose book etc .,technology
yeah and movable object .,technology
yeah thats how it started and now where it go from here .,technology
there a lot more people involved and to know you and others .,technology
hopefully we can continue to do this work and one day into their future maybe publish some preliminary result .,technology
bring on the engineer and yeah .,technology
whats the actual description of that way they made these face in egypt or even before ?,technology
whats whats the the main source explanation for the making process ?,technology
from what ?,technology
and i think thats evolved that continues to evolve from what i gather the mainstream explanation relates primarily to alibaster .,technology
alibaster is widely known to have been performed in executed beautifully .,technology
in a lot of case bydiedastic egyptian during the ldap old middle and late kingdom .,technology
and alibaster i think truly speaking you would be able to find a joke about alibaster you would using various pounding stone dollarnother thing get a spherical object for you then use some a boring instrument a tubular drill potentially copper with an abrasive .,technology
somehow you have to drill out these interior center .,technology
now curiously some of these the alibaster one are more commonly left with a tube drill and not hollowed out .,technology
some of them are but the hollowing out part typically is explained by this forkstickbased drill .,technology
thats placed inside and then turned and it would scrape out the inside quartz sand and some water and some other abrasive material .,technology
i do not think it is necessarily known what they were using but it is a desert .,technology
there quartz everywhere .,technology
court is a rough way .,technology
it is a heart .,technology
it is a seven on the most scale where alibasters a three .,technology
that would easily cut .,technology
the roman and others were using bronze with i think very little abrasive to cut calcite now alibaster .,technology
some of the stone can be cut with out precision tool whatsoever with very rudimentary hand tool .,technology
that in limestone they are shaped they are beautiful .,technology
there many there probably million of there everywhere .,technology
they are interesting and they are pretty but they are not made to anything close to the level of sophistication that we see in some of the quote unquote predynastic phase .,technology
the stuff thats acknowledged to the older and it is in a harder medium .,technology
we are talking about deer and and granits are there are all the harder of quartz .,technology
and some of these stone are most of the stone are all they are all hard or genius in composition and mineral composition .,technology
meaning there lot of stuff inside them .,technology
it is not one these crystalline collusion and do these stuff. ?,technology
it itself ha a a composition of six to seven eight different type of mineral normally and then when these large this could be felt sport probably felt sport .,technology
they are the pinkish hue or quartz sometimes quartz .,technology
thats going to be a different hardness of different mineral composition and the ground mass material that in dark and darker shade .,technology
thats going to require a positive material of this exactly .,technology
they call it poorfree which is a conglomerate of different material .,technology
the hardness is in a very hardish component of poorfree would probably be the quartz which is around a seven .,technology
if you are looking for a numerical scale thats the most scale .,technology
but it is possible that there other thing in there .,technology
how is whats an abrasive ?,technology
it is a remgenit in oddness .,technology
yeah it is comparable .,technology
it is closer to greater than it is to all of u or anything .,technology
it is probably about that same .,technology
but the way you would go about cutting it it is not a homogeneous piece of seven on the most you need to figure out .,technology
we have harder and softer material inside correct .,technology
and the mineral composition can vary in term of size a . amazing coat .,technology
i know you can pull it shrug easily be it hand but it is still when you this is the first time when i can hold such thing and see with my bare eye and it is beautiful .,technology
even though you said maybe it is handmade .,technology
or not entirely .,technology
this this may not this doesnt appear to have we are doing somewhere now on this now .,technology
but this doesnt appear to be to the same caliber .,technology
a lot of the other piece we scanned it out .,technology
some of them are nearly perfect in every dimensional component of the piece the og .,technology
that doesnt have any flat surface .,technology
everything ha a rainy eye and all the radio are are there phenomenon ?,technology
thats whats candid that first go on ?,technology
or yes weve scanned that several time it is several different device .,technology
weve done it with some with blue light structure light scanning .,technology
weve done it with ct scanning .,technology
we do not want to gravitate the process of scan a they increase in their level of accuracy .,technology
weve seen where accurate result because now the scanner is capable of picking up .,technology
thats a great .,technology
we see result where it is it is five five ten000th of an inch .,technology
way le than 1000th of an inch in term of deviation from perfect circle .,technology
thats le than twenty five light run .,technology
all it is ten micron deviation per per le .,technology
and that level of work is today the way that would be done today .,technology
we could talk about the about the how but it is done today .,technology
but it is reserved for specific application .,technology
and it is done in a modernist material or a most often a metal alloy .,technology
it can be a tip by type of silica a glass for a somebody recently told me the only time youve seen this level of work done is in the lens of a sidewinder missile where it is a it is a type of silica glass .,technology
and it is large .,technology
it is this big .,technology
normally that level of deviation or or tolerance of ua or accuracy is directly related to the size of the object .,technology
the smaller the object would normally correspond to the smaller tolerance thats required to be maintained .,technology
larger object typical do not require that level of tolerance and they are rarely done even in the metal .,technology
it is very rare that you would see a large object .,technology
this is not i do not not saying this is a accurate a the other one whereas some of the other day is that weve looked at but a larger object of this size would be very rare or uncommon to see such small tolerance a applied .,technology
it would not be necessary for any conceivable application .,technology
the lower tolerance is would be required by lower component by smaller component .,technology
thats an additional reason why it is rare .,technology
and the machine we have today are set up and the procedure are set up for clomogenous material .,technology
is this from the same guy same diplomat ?,technology
and through the og day now different is it different from yeah ?,technology
and there many of these thing they were they were hinted out to people .,technology
is the point ?,technology
someone wa visiting and they came home with tenonies .,technology
you said that maybe the lip is not the precise a the neck or the top .,technology
yeah it is hard to speculate .,technology
when you stay back from across the room it look very nice and then you come up with a closeup .,technology
it is because we scanned it .,technology
yeah we will i would defer until we see the scan .,technology
many of these have been dropped and damaged and repolished .,technology
you also see divot that were purposefully smoothed out .,technology
a in some of the grant box the box overall shape look pretty nice when you come up close .,technology
you may see an imperfection that wa then scooped out they looked out and then repolished very carefully potentially because they did not work that imperfection to propagate and expand .,technology
and doe that take away from the overall accuracy ?,technology
it is going to affect the scaling result .,technology
we need to look at these thing comprehensively before we make any conclusion .,technology
the last thing i would say is about this topic is what we can talk about this more .,technology
but in two thousand and fifteen there wa an electron microscopy a microscope a project done by the metropole a metropole a microscope a microscope a microscope .,technology
it is a hundred .,technology
the metropole did not use the inmobart in new york did a study on this about two thousand and fifteen i think .,technology
and they had a limestone block with a cordial in it which is not a common .,technology
that all around egypt but limestone sometimes will have le common to see that .,technology
anyway there seem to be residual material in the bottom .,technology
potentially potentially it wa left over from the last piece of equipment to have done that .,technology
until they said this is interesting .,technology
we see all this residue let analyze it .,technology
and under an electron microscope you can potentially look at the mineral composition .,technology
and they found they found the number of interesting thing there .,technology
they did find bronze and copper residue .,technology
thats whats surprising .,technology
that reinforces the main tree of the they also found quartz and corundum .,technology
some more recently corundum is aluminum the deoxyne if i am not mistaken .,technology
a little bit of oxide is the composition and it occurs naturally a corundum .,technology
corundum and then there different type of gemstone that are a form of corundum a . gemstone mining if you are looking for specific gemstone you may find different type of corundum that you can repurpose and there are gemstone mine in egypt .,technology
this stuff wa there .,technology
there an active corundum mine in egypt still to this day .,technology
it is not unknown where it came from .,technology
but corundum is very hard .,technology
it is a mine on the hardness scale .,technology
it is under a diamond .,technology
and that would have been more than enough to cut most of the material that we see in pyramid and base and everything else .,technology
if you are trying to embrace itll be cut it .,technology
corundum wa found .,technology
and i think that reinforces the view that you could use a soft material copper bronze and a very artobracive slurry or solution that could have quartz and corundum in it and cut through the lens still very easily .,technology
you could cut through granite with that fairly easily .,technology
i think thats the main stream perspective is that thats how these thing were cut .,technology
and indeed that would cut all of these material but cutting and finishing are two different thing .,technology
and when we see not only the cutting but in the polishing that result in a thousand of an inch twenty five micron zero.twenty five millimeter in instead of deviation from perfect circle in term of circularity that can not be done by rudimentary handle .,technology
it can not .,technology
it is not possible .,technology
it is not possible to get there .,technology
you have to make that do a bit something which is the same you are at at least but you have to go feel several magnitude lower or higher in inaccuracy .,technology
typically the tool thats making something need to be capable of making something more accurate than what you are trying to make .,technology
thats to that standard .,technology
you typically can not take a tool thats capable of a point one inch and make something thats a tenth of an inch and make something thats a thousandth of an inch end up .,technology
whats the tumbler for this in menstrual logic ?,technology
the rule ?,technology
yeah for how accurate the device ha to be to reach that level .,technology
in the trial time ?,technology
if we are talking about the tool or the metrology in i think it is generally ten time it is about an order of magnitude ?,technology
if we are talking about metrology how do if what you are doing is that accurate ?,technology
tenth of an inch we can probably see with our eye .,technology
and you can measure that with variety tool .,technology
thousand of an inch you can not .,technology
that level of accuracy is not visible to the human eye .,technology
you find it. . human hair. . fraction .,technology
you can not see that with the naked eye .,technology
and thats maintained across the entire historical body of an object .,technology
and a lot of these object are polished .,technology
when you are polishing an object you are going to do something .,technology
you are going to remove material .,technology
you have to measure how much should i remove from this way or from this direction to reach that precision .,technology
and do i have to i should more here more here more here more here .,technology
these thing are very difficult to do .,technology
they are very difficult to do by today standard in homogenous medium that are softer to cut .,technology
this is a heterogeneous medium .,technology
it is a lot harder to work in .,technology
and we do not have we do not have we do not even have the metrology .,technology
the metrology we have is designed for heterogeneous material glass different metal alloy .,technology
not we do not have stone based metrology because we do not make thing in stone .,technology
we do not have tool for it .,technology
we can we can probably repurpose our tool but there a lot of other reason why it would be quite difficult .,technology
very expensive .,technology
you wouldnt ask somebody for a quote .,technology
you would expect that you are going to pay however much it cost because nobody know how much it is going to cost going to do it .,technology
two thousand slave .,technology
have you seen this experiment on the scientist against myth channel when they made with traditional method they made a granite vase and they converted it with museum piece .,technology
not precisely it wa not scanned precisely or not measured precisely but i do not know that wa a debunker video but it is a little bit funny .,technology
they in my opinion they proved that they can not make these precise way .,technology
this is with the traditional method .,technology
thats funny .,technology
we can use them to illustrate or play .,technology
i commend them for the diligence and dedication to doing that .,technology
it wa impressive .,technology
i wa not i am not going to sit down for whatever it took them a year or two .,technology
i think two year .,technology
thats the mainstream explanation a these were taking several year .,technology
it took them that long using rudimentary technique but they did not replicate these way .,technology
they made something thats rudimentary .,technology
you can see in the video it is not it is not the same .,technology
and when they measured it they did not measure correctly .,technology
a metrology wasnt performed correctly .,technology
they werent looking at deviation .,technology
they were they were they were doing absolute measurement in comparison .,technology
meter both thickness and these .,technology
and this is not there in anything .,technology
it tell that you made something similar in size in similar form .,technology
but yeah the accuracy wasnt there .,technology
but these wa on the centimeter or maybe subsentimeter level but not migrant not even close to migrant .,technology
they are measurement they are not even close to .,technology
and they threw their hand up and said we can not it is not worth it or we do not want to .,technology
that doesnt prove that it that they couldnt then apply a different method .,technology
it is a polishing it down to the accuracy we want .,technology
if they if they roughed out a basic shape then you could go back and finish it maybe with a different method .,technology
i think that there are no hand there are no primitive handbased method that can result in it .,technology
whatever we are talking about we are talking about the use of a machine tool for sure .,technology
now what are the dynamic created with having in the way of machine almost nothing ?,technology
now more often i think more recently there archaeologist and he a topologist that may acknowledge they had to lay it and they had primitive accessbased machine potentially .,technology
and that could help u get a little bit closer .,technology
it is still not enough .,technology
we we learned how to do this decade ago decade ago .,technology
in the 1800s we did not have the capability of making it .,technology
but from everything ive seen and gathered it wa probably 1940s 1950s where we first started being able to achieve these level of tolerance in metal .,technology
from what ive seen it is never been done in granted using modern technology .,technology
we havent seen any example of that .,technology
again we are not seeing a care .,technology
and these are definitely turn when we go down in the in the steptorow meeting sakara .,technology
we have seen those piece and you do not told me that you have some base in there .,technology
you have turning mark in the inside .,technology
we can see line that rotate with the audio of the vessel .,technology
extrations that go around and around .,technology
we are examining a piece a shard an it is a march i guess when we were in egypt with chris king and he realized or he noticed that there are turning mark on this .,technology
it wa a broken part from the from the lower section of a way .,technology
it wa also granite or some similar hard stone and you could clearly see the turning line or the turning mark the tool mark .,technology
these were somehow turned .,technology
or the machine wa revolving .,technology
i do not know if we can prove which one .,technology
there always been a debate or wa the tool spinning or wa the object spinning ?,technology
the the object spinning .,technology
well be returning .,technology
chris king ha had the feeling that it the object wa turning and not the not the on that piece on that piece .,technology
but we can talk with him in a few days. . it .,technology
in other word it is pretty hard to use a tool capable of a tenth of an inch to go to anything higher than that .,technology
it is almost impossible .,technology
it is a chicken and egg problem .,technology
how do we get through the next level of accuracy ?,technology
we need to have those tool .,technology
we need to have the engineering and the knowhow to then translate that into making tool repetitively that are capable producing this accuracy .,technology
it is a chicken and egg problem ?,technology
we do not know what came first .,technology
you do not know how you get there .,technology
thats how it did for u . and it is built up over a long period of time .,technology
one thing to note i you mentioned this with the scientist against that example .,technology
but when we talk about accuracy or tolerance we are talking about state or deviation normally in modern in machining today when something is specified it is usually describing the max deviation .,technology
thats allowed .,technology
we are going to make this cylindrical shape and the max tolerance might be 100th of an inch or zero.two millimeter .,technology
and thats maximum because this this implement all the tool that we generally make today that are designed to tolerance is our functional .,technology
if somethings functioning spinning on an axis we do not want part of it to be rotating and maybe hitting something or interfering with another component or the meaning of that it is spinning inside of ?,technology
thats why tolerance is important because of the function .,technology
why would why would a vase or a vessel need that tolerance ?,technology
of course the traditional explanation is that the holding something mundane flower or water or body oil clearly pottery doe that a . it is a lot easier to make .,technology
and these are holding something why would you need any level of accuracy whatsoever ?,technology
you can see that a certain stone vessel may be very nice looking .,technology
it doesnt have to be that accurate .,technology
it doesnt have to be accurate down to the thousand or a tenzero of an inch .,technology
today they make glass container .,technology
have they ever found glass container in predynastic graf or silver ?,technology
there libyan desert glass which is allegedly created when lightning get the desert and some of those glass piece have been repurposed into object .,technology
i do not think they made glass from desert court .,technology
you need an extremely high temperature and typically electricity is used for that .,technology
i do not think they were making glass .,technology
they were cutting hard stone .,technology
they cut there a desk cut or anything sometimes .,technology
very rarely .,technology
when you did you could see it .,technology
you can see it with your naked eye and it is a little different from the highpresident stone vessel .,technology
because my body oil is perfectly happy in the last container .,technology
thats what i asked .,technology
how much body oil wa one person in the do you need a jug of it in your room in your house at all ?,technology
you pour it in on your head ?,technology
whats that ?,technology
whats going on with all the body oil ?,technology
i do not they do .,technology
they do it in a party .,technology
these egyptian .,technology
these essential oil are nice from egypt .,technology
but they are all in glass container which you can buy today .,technology
you go back to your point .,technology
you need tool and metrology .,technology
you need tool that are capable of generally access accuracy and precision when you are making something .,technology
because of a few thing you have fluctuation and temperature .,technology
you have dust particle and chemical and thing that that can get in the way .,technology
a little tiny piece of sand can get onto something and change thing .,technology
you have wear and tear and damage from repeated use of the tool .,technology
take a look at what cutting glass doe to a tool or trying to make crystal object .,technology
the super precise .,technology
you are putting a lot of wear and tear on a tool thats using an abrasive a forceful mechanism to remove matter .,technology
then you have the abrasion the corrosion and the general degradation to consider .,technology
thats before you are considering the vibrational load that you are putting on a tool .,technology
the manufacturing process itself is going to create a lot of heat and friction .,technology
if you are designing a tool you need to account for that .,technology
what secondary side effect are going to be created when i am starting to hit the spinning renovation or my tool spinning and hitting a stationary rabbit base .,technology
we need to take those into consideration when we are designing our tool .,technology
we are talking about sophistication sophistication thats light year above what the diagnostic egyptian certainly have been credited with .,technology
now the mainstream criticism wa that people could master simple tool if you gave someone a hammer or a chisel or thirty year they would learn how to make a michael angela david sculpture out of marble .,technology
i think thats thats possibly true when you are talking about artistic expression and artistic skill .,technology
we are talking about precision in quality and in notin result .,technology
no simple tool is going to be capable of that .,technology
no matter how skilled the artist is the tool is not capable of it .,technology
those object are not granite they are marble and which is much softer and i am lying stone .,technology
yeah exactly .,technology
i think thats an easy way out and it is not a logical either .,technology
the knowledge engineering it took to figure out how to build these type of tool it took u hundred of year to build .,technology
to build tool capable of reliably doing this or an organ it mean that engineer and metrologists but engineer need to repeatedly measure thing far beyond the limit of human perception .,technology
in an actual manufacturing environment not the finished product but the environment where all this heat and friction is being generated a which deforms the tool and creates other side effect repeatedly .,technology
when you are machining you have this intense build up a heat in both the object and the instrument .,technology
this heat can cause additional error sometimes a lot .,technology
i think this all speaks to the argument that the highest accuracy it may have ensued with some process that wasnt forcible that wasnt in a breeze .,technology
we are not crushing and bashing and knocking piece of the stone away .,technology
we are not flaking it off making a flint spearhead or arrowhead .,technology
thats how they try to rough it out in the sianti stigensmith video .,technology
i saw a copper chisel knocking away visible visible piece of itll mineral content in the stone and the accuracy is far smaller than the visible piece .,technology
and theyve tried to measure the circularity with a hand held pencil .,technology
then it is drawing a line or not on the circular object .,technology
it is yes it is nice to the eye but it is not .,technology
i had the feeling that they do not even understand what we are talking about here .,technology
the metric .,technology
that wa my feeling that this is nice .,technology
this is a very great effort but not are we talking about .,technology
it is nice to see people roll up their sleeve and do something instead of criticize other people online .,technology
i think you have to respect that and give them what i do .,technology
yeah yeah do i. i think that whatever listen if we are having trouble figuring out a way to do today .,technology
i think the answer is they were they had it they had an unknown process with respect to some of the thing they were doing at least that wa either more advanced than we have today or we are something we are not thinking of .,technology
there could be an easy answer that we are not thinking of but the best mind have the best mind of manufacturing have been struggling with this concept for progressive year .,technology
i think the answer is something we are we are something we are missing all together .,technology
thats thats how we connected in in egypt because i told you this project project of mine and yeah your idea wa to let work together because much more effective and this is much more it is wiser to work together in the sembler force .,technology
it depends and it also depends on the application too we are talking about heterogeneous stone again with damaging we are in terror .,technology
sustainability deviation is not always used sometimes maximum or absolute is also yeah yes sometimes we may get a standard deviation but a lot of time there you give the machine instruction usually the tolerance conveyed in term of maximum due to maximum allowable deviation .,technology
do we know in the mexel deviation on the scan ?,technology
yeah we have that too it is the maximum minimum are going to be they should be equal to equal distance for me again i think chipping and breaking piece of stone off is not the logical explanation in term of how these are done .,technology
what about chipping and then pollution ?,technology
yeah to devil in the detail why how would you measure how much you should polish on that side to reach the other side level ?,technology
a we evolve we are using war stone toning again .,technology
then the high level precision is needed yeah .,technology
this is a ... is it called the egyptian cubic the disblack rickting not rectangular but octagonal yeah i think sometimes it wrote something that yeah some a rod yeah is this black is not it basult ?,technology
i think it wa granite could be black granite yeah true .,technology
since the dawn of civilization spy of every nation and culture have worked to infiltrate their adversary and glean the information that will give their side the advantage .,technology
the stake are sky high the strategy is varied and imaginative and the ultimate sign of success is that no one ever even knew you were there .,technology
in each episode we will explore the moral and ethical gray zone of espionage where treachery and betrayal go hand in hand with cunning and courage .,technology
this is the spycraft one hundred and one podcast .,technology

he also the host of the spy valley podcast from project brazen which debuted last year about a cold warera spy in the heart of silicon valley .,technology
i invited zach onto the podcast to discus his newest article published on august 4th of this year titled moscow spy were stealing u.s. tech until the fbi started a sabotage campaign .,technology
it is the story of operation entering a highly successful and neverbeforereported operation against soviet block intelligence operative targeting u.s. technology in the early 1980s .,technology

justin thank you much for having me .,technology
of course of course .,technology
i loved hearing your work on the spy valley podcast last year but at the time i did not expect that id be speaking to you myself one day but here we are .,technology
first of all i am glad that you mentioned the spy valley podcast which wa a blast to report and write and host and i am thrilled to be here .,technology
with operation entering this article debuted a few day ago and it wa brand new to me and apparently it wa brand new to everyone .,technology
how did you first learn about this story enough to start digging into it for your own work ?,technology
i am based in san francisco and i am an odd duck because i am a national security reporter who is based on the west coast and for i think obvious reason and mostly good reason .,technology
the vast majority pretty much all national security reporting is centered in the washington dc area .,technology
but i wanted to take silicon valley and the west coast on it own term a a place where important thing in national security and intelligence and counterintelligence were occurring .,technology
and year ago when i started going down this road this career path i began reaching out to folk who had spent year sometimes decade of working on intelligence and counterintelligence issue on the west coast and silicon valley in particular .,technology
and some of those folk were active throughout the later decade of the cold war which wa a hugely important time in counterintelligence issue in silicon valley .,technology
there wa a core or a cadre of folk who moved out to san francisco many of them from the east coast in the early to mid 70 and stayed together a a group for decade which created this interesting espri decor .,technology
and they also developed a reputation a some of the best counterintelligence personnel that the bureau had nationally .,technology
dc wa always thats the heart center of everything .,technology
new york obviously had a lot going on but san francisco wa always considered cream of the crop when it came to fbi counterintelligence folk .,technology
it is important to set that context the culture that wa there at the time within the bureau and this almost band of brother attitude that you had .,technology
and having known rick for year weve had coffee on and off and he wa he wa willing to lean in and share a story that originated through some of his hard work running a very important counterintelligence campaign out of san francisco which is called operation entering .,technology
and thats the genesis of my introduction to the story and to the world of rick and some of his fbi compatriot .,technology
fantastic that you built that level of trust with those guy who are it sound they were very a closed circle almost i guess but then you were able to get to know them enough and get them to open up about something a fascinating a this .,technology
after rick after you learned about this wa it difficult to develop the complete story ?,technology
because you are only getting one perspective initially from the fbi the eyesight i take it .,technology
i do not think i ever get the complete story especially a an intelligence reporter .,technology
i do not ever believe that i have the complete story .,technology
i do not even know if there is such a thing a a complete story .,technology
i think not to wax too philosophical about it but i think that there always there a reason why they call it the wilderness of mirror .,technology
there always gray area .,technology
certainly with this story i felt i had a very good understanding from the bureau perspective .,technology
i would have loved to have had the understanding from the soviet block side being able to potentially look at some of the soviet block archive related to this operation and how they viewed it would have been fascinating .,technology
and then of course the main source that rick and the fbi used the fbi agent whom i spoke including rick were not they were not willing to share this person name with me .,technology
and i wa unable to independently identify this person .,technology
of course i would in theory that person perspective a . but all in all i wa very happy with the level of detail i wa able to provide because it is honestly it wa unusual for me and i think in general .,technology
the whole story no certainly not .,technology
but a level of granularity that i thought wa good and important a a historical example absolutely .,technology
zach you are definitely preaching to the choir on that part .,technology
i can not count the number of time here on the podcast .,technology
ive said something along the line of well probably never know the rest of the story unfortunately .,technology
i definitely picked the wrong niche to get into a an amateur historian trying to find out what happened at the bottom of thing .,technology
but yeah absolutely endlessly fascinating topic .,technology
and i do enjoy that little air of mystery thats in your article about the identity of the central figure of the article .,technology
but it is a you read through it of course it is very understandable why they would not have revealed that information why that person would not have gone public themselves a well get into certainly .,technology
we mentioned of course it is called operation entering .,technology
what exactly wa it ?,technology
what were the goal of operation entering ?,technology
operation entering wa an fbi offensive counterintelligence operation that ran from the very early 1980s to about one thousand nine hundred and eighty three .,technology
pretty significant amount of time .,technology
and the objective wa to have somebody who wa under fbi control and fbi asset pretend to be a crooked businessman from silicon valley willing to sell the soviet block technology that wa dual use and export prohibited .,technology
dual use mean that it ha both civilian and military or intelligence related uses. . and there wa a whole host of technology then a now that are prohibited to export to russia and the soviet block then and russia today .,technology
and what the bureau did wa they they said look we know that the soviet and their ally are greedy for the cutting edge in american high tech .,technology
and at the time that wa that wa microchip .,technology
and then a now the russian were world leader in this ?,technology
especially after the two thousand and twenty two full scale invasion of ukraine there wa another clampdown where there wa more sanction and the sanction on the russian .,technology
and they also once again started engaging in the same they never stopped but it got much more intensive after the u.s. and it ally put the screw on russian importation of dual use good .,technology
their reaction then wa very similar to their reaction postukraine ?,technology
the bureau knew this and the bureau decided to go on the offensive .,technology
and rick and his colleague decided what we are going to do is we are going to find somebody who going to be willing to pretend to be this crook and to sell the soviet and their ally technology that ha been sabotaged for tamper .,technology
and there wa a whole bunch of reason why they decided to do that .,technology
but that is the thats the view from tenzero foot of the operation .,technology
it went on for year .,technology
it wa very successful .,technology
they managed to get the soviet block to purchase million of dollar in in tampered tampered u good .,technology
and i am sure there lot of other operation of this sort that have been carried out over the year and executed .,technology
but this is a rare example i think of a revelation in the public sphere about how the bureau thought about this stuff and a bureau success .,technology
wa this a top down initiative or wa this something that rick developed himself or one of his coworkers there in san francisco developed themselves and sold from the bottom up to speak ?,technology
this but for any listener a he doesnt know about farewell there wa a kgb officer who wa a senior officer who worked in moscow in the kgb st science and technology division .,technology
his last name wa vetrov .,technology
he wa recruited by the french .,technology
he wa recruited by the french domestic service if i remember correctly which is interesting .,technology
but he wa recruited by the french and he provided what became known a the farewell dossier .,technology
and farewell wa the code name that the french gave to him .,technology
farewell dossier wa an exhaustive list of all of the technology that the soviet and their ally had either stolen successfully or were looking to steal ?,technology
it wa these were shopping list .,technology
and what they did wa this is important for entering what the soviet did what the kgb did wa they had a list of stuff that they themselves were we are going to steal this stuff .,technology
and then they also handed out shopping list to all the different allied soviet block service ?,technology
entering focused on the east german and the bulgarian but you also have check the pole the hungarian .,technology
there wa an understanding by the early 1980s of the extent of this problem ?,technology
thats the world in which rick smith wa operating where the cia and of course the french then french intelligence passed the farewell dossier on to the cia .,technology
the fbi knew the extent of the issue .,technology
but this wa a case where this wa rick initiative ?,technology
this wa rick initiative saying what there this guy i met him .,technology
rick this all came together in a bar in san francisco ?,technology
rick knew who this guy wa because he wa a he wa a entrepreneur .,technology
he wa a silicon valley entrepreneur .,technology
he wa austrian by nationality .,technology
they knew he had tried to legally i went on our line legally drum up business with the soviet .,technology
the bureau would routinely obviously surveil the soviet consulate in san francisco .,technology
they realized that this guy wa going out of the consulate .,technology
they determined that his his business objective were completely above board .,technology
they approached him .,technology
they said maybe you can work with u . it did not work .,technology
nothing worked out .,technology
thats fine .,technology
stuff that happens .,technology
and rick forgot all about him .,technology
and then about a year later he run into this guy at a bar randomly .,technology
and it is a great bar by the way .,technology
it is called the galboa cafe .,technology
it still exists .,technology
if anybody is ever in san francisco it is worth a trip out to the calhalla neighborhood .,technology
it is a beautiful historic bar .,technology
and rick see this guy in the bar and strike up a conversation and start thinking himself what this guy ha the perfect background for being recruited by the fbi working with u and then pretending to be a crook ?,technology
and that wa how interim all came together .,technology
i talk about bill for hour .,technology
bill wa bill wa an amazing guy who did extraordinary work for decade at the fbi office in san francisco all exclusively counterintelligence work .,technology
rick and bill coran this case from san francisco .,technology
yeah this wa an example of the initiative and daring do of the fbi folk in san francisco. . yeah it sound it .,technology
and from that i guess you would say surprising beginning it spun up into something clearly enormous .,technology
and what do you think that rick anticipated or wanted that at all at the time that he see this a the start of something huge ?,technology
or wa this an opportunity that might be worth exploring ?,technology
wanted it i am sure .,technology
i am sure he wa thrilled at the time .,technology
yeah i do not know .,technology
beyond that i think i do not think it ever got too big .,technology
i think it wa i think when you talk to rick about it i think it wa a complex operation .,technology
and how much do you let through thats unadulterated ?,technology
there wa a ton of stuff that these folk were thinking about at the time .,technology
and it is amazing to me that they were able to run it for a long a they did .,technology
and then of course there the concern about the health and safety of the source that you are using a . that wa a big part of it too .,technology
i think i do not know if i answered your question but one thing that i walked away from and pressed by wa the complexity of the operation and the ability to pull something that off .,technology
and it seems extremely difficult to manage .,technology
and it is easy to see many way it could have gone terribly wrong .,technology
their their risk assessment and their risk mitigation had to be very carefully thought out because you talk about they have to give some functional dual use technology to their greatest adversary of the time a part of a larger operation .,technology
somebody ha to sign off on that .,technology
somebody ha to explain clearly why this is ultimately of benefit to the united state and to the detriment of our adversary that thing .,technology
yeah and i should i should also mention i spoke to somebody else for the story who wa also an extraordinary fbi counterintelligence agent .,technology
also he retired retired for a long time a long time .,technology
he retired for a long time .,technology
his name is ed appel .,technology
and ed oversaw the case from dc .,technology
ed wa running the east german and bulgarian desk at fbi headquarters .,technology
ed ha also had a extraordinary career in fbi counterintelligence .,technology
and he it is interesting because ed perspective on this on this operation wa a little different because he wa he wa catching the brunt of the heat from dc about it .,technology
rick wa running the operation .,technology
he wa he wa out there in san francisco overseeing .,technology
he wa flying around .,technology
but the bureaucratic issue that arose i think ed felt those more tangibly .,technology
and to give a couple of example there wa an interagency process that had to govern all of this .,technology
there were called equity at play ?,technology
the pentagon according to ed did not this operation .,technology
they they he had to fight tooth and nail to keep this operation going because the pentagon wa wait what ?,technology
pretty much exactly what you said .,technology
the pentagon wa you are telling me that a good chunk of this stuff that could in theory assist soviet military capability you are going to let that go .,technology
you are going to let you are going to let that stuff go through .,technology
before we go on i want to tell you all about a new podcast from tenderfoot tv called to die for .,technology
imagine you were a fly on the wall at a dinner between the mafia the cia and the kgb .,technology
thats where this unprecedented podcast begin .,technology
brought to you by the maker of the hit podcast to live and die in la .,technology
to die for mark the first time a russian trained honey trap ha told her story from beginning to end .,technology
taught to seduce men for their secret and sometimes their life .,technology
alia rosa wa trained to believe that her body no longer belonged to her .,technology
it belonged to the state .,technology
she wa meticulously trained to be the perfect weapon able to seduce her target into compromising situation that have ended career and sometimes life .,technology
from tenderfoot tv the studio that brought you up and vanished and to live and die in la .,technology
make sure you check out to die for available beginning on march 26th wherever you get your podcast .,technology
and of course the bureau said yeah we have to do that .,technology
we have to for the ruse to be viable a certain percentage of it ha to work correctly .,technology
and the pentagon apparently at the time did not that .,technology
there wa the pentagon there wa commerce wa involved .,technology
the doj and the attorney general wa involved because of course you need to create a waiver where you are saying look we know this guy is breaking this source .,technology
the austrian this guy is breaking a lot of law and we need to allow him to keep breaking american law because he doing it on behalf of the u government .,technology
that wa a interesting part of it too .,technology
and also it i think a thing that i do not think your listener need to be reminded of but i think it is always it is important to underline it about the cliche or caricature of the u intelligence community and then the reality of it .,technology
this is a case where there were many different layer of bureaucracy checking what wa going on with contending interest and making sure that there wa you had legal review from the doj side and you had assessment of potential damage on the pentagon side .,technology
and then the bureau had multiple layer ?,technology
and there wa there wa a lot of very high level interagency debate and discussion over this .,technology
and to be honest frankly i found that reassuring because because i wa good this is sensitive and you do not want to have something this happen where it is one fbi agent in san francisco who doing this ?,technology
this you had multiple layer of review and these contending perspective that allowed them to continue for a long a they could but i am sure also constrained them in certain way .,technology
sure i can i can certainly see that .,technology
wa the this operation wa a success by pretty much any measure but wa the overarching goal to i can see several potential here but wa it to get them to waste their limited fund on stuff that did not work ?,technology
wa it to identify the supply chain and the personnel involved in getting restricted item over to soviet union or something else or a combination of everything ?,technology
it wa all those thing .,technology
look let go through it one by one because i think this is i think this is important to understand why these operation are run and that the multiple advantage that they can accrue .,technology
a you said one way this doe it is it help you map out illegal importation network and intelligence officer and their asset that are involved in tech transfer and tech theft ?,technology
thats advantage number one .,technology
and another thing that i would love to have known about this story but i do not is what intelligence may have been passed from the bureau and the cia to partner abroad and ally abroad about hey guess what ?,technology
you have a network problem here you have an issue in austria or in the netherlands or in switzerland ?,technology
there there that stuff too .,technology
thats thats one part of it .,technology
the other part of it is a you mentioned you can start to map out a picture of what your adversary want and need and doesnt have and why they might want it ?,technology
and that is a way of gathering intelligence which might be a little counterintuitive but can be very very valuable ?,technology
because you do not know what necessarily all of the intelligence requirement on the st side are for your adversary until you are figuring out precisely what they are asking for .,technology
thats another thats another big advantage of it .,technology
the third advantage which you also mentioned is that especially in those day but today a hard currency is valuable ?,technology
you are draining your adversary coffer ?,technology
you are you are forcing them to spend u dollar in the many million ?,technology
when that that also imposes a cost on them .,technology
and then of course you are theoretically arresting or retarding their st research and development .,technology
and i want to i want to underline something here which is the soviet bloc in entering wasnt asking for microchip .,technology
they were also asking for a highly specialized computer production equipment and technology ?,technology
they wanted to steal the tech reverse engineer the tech build factory that would then allow them to replicate the tech ?,technology
because thats a lot easier .,technology
there a certain point you do not want to steal microchip by the hundred ?,technology
you want to steal the design what the chinese do today .,technology
and then you want to build a factory that produce it .,technology
and thats what they were trying to do .,technology
some of the technology that wa sabotaged were these highly specialized computer production tool .,technology
there is some evidence that i wa able to piece together about the success of this ?,technology
because the main east bloc agency that the fbi reeled in were the bulgarian .,technology
and i found some evidence from a bulgarian academic who go back through his country cold war archive .,technology
and around the exact same time that entering wa going on there wa a secret agreement between the kgb and the bulgarian intelligence service where the kgb told the bulgarian you need to get u this computer production equipment .,technology
once you get that equipment for u we are going to build computer production factory in russia in russia proper .,technology
and we are going to indigenously produce this stuff .,technology
now according to the academic research that i found they did in fact put this factory together but it wa beset by a lot of delay .,technology
now maybe that wa because of entering maybe that wa because of other thing .,technology
and by the time the factory got up and running the technology that they were supposed to produce wa completely absolute .,technology
now look i do not know for one hundred fact that that wa because of entering but this is this is another data point that strongly suggests the overall success of that operation .,technology
endless frustration for the other side .,technology
do you happen to know what percentage a an example of functional stuff had to be sent over ?,technology
i am imagining after a couple of shipment where practically everything is garbage that they start to get suspicious or at the very least frustrated pretty quickly .,technology
i do not know the exact percentage but i do know that again i do not know the percentage this either but a percentage of the tech wa not sabotaged .,technology
it wa shipped clean .,technology
a percentage of it wa sabotaged in a way to make it appear it wa normal wear and tear you get an amazon package and you are hey what the hell ? .,technology
and some of it wa made to look there wa a problem with the shipment .,technology
we are the bureau replaced it with sandbag .,technology
it look something something got messed up in the in the intermediary step ?,technology
because you had in order to in order to keep the ultimate end user a recipient of these these shipment hidden what the soviet block did then .,technology
and of course the russian the chinese the iranian etc .,technology
do today is you create all these different trans shipper all over the world to to hide the ultimate the ultimate recipient .,technology
sometimes the stuff did not get there .,technology
and then sometimes the stuff wa altered in a way that wa imperceptible ?,technology
and i suspect strongly that wa probably in the shipment that dealt with production production tool themselves ?,technology
where these are testing tool to make sure that the chip are working correctly or everything is calibrated perfectly and finally .,technology
and you create some you do something that alters the thing that is that calibrates it to a certain extent .,technology
even an expert in a factory in russia or elsewhere in the eastern bloc might not might not see or understand that something ha been subtly altered ?,technology
and thats thats the way you keep an operation going and then subtly and subtly and systematically degrade the production capability of an adversary ?,technology
if you think about it that is an amazing way over time to degrade an adversary .,technology
and i think that wa also in the mix .,technology
yeah very very clever .,technology
and that brings up a great point .,technology
wa that the fbi agent themselves manipulating this technology ?,technology
or did they have to bring in the producer themselves and buy sabotage equipment or hire contractor or something ?,technology
how did that work exactly ?,technology
yeah there some there some there some muddiness there for me .,technology
and one thing that is not muddy ill say is that the company themselves had no idea .,technology
they were not they were not winning party to any of this .,technology
and that introduces some interesting ethical question a . but i think this is all done because what happened wa you had these american company cule packard for instance wa one of them .,technology
and they sold stuff to american distributor .,technology
and then x number of step later it would find it way to the eastern bloc ?,technology
they had no idea because they were never selling .,technology
these american producer were never selling directly to the eastern bloc .,technology
they had no direct role in the scheme .,technology
they had no knowledge of the scheme .,technology
the second part of your question it is a interesting one .,technology
there were specialized u government technician that were brought in to help sabotage this high tech .,technology
i do not know if they were fbi .,technology
i think they came from multiple agency .,technology
some of that work wa done in london a part of entering but i do not i do not know precisely who did it .,technology
i know that it is not rick himself or bill himself bill wa doing it ?,technology
these are fbi case agent ?,technology
they do not they did not have the technical skill or understanding to do that work which is extraordinarily specialized .,technology
i think there are folk in nsa for instance who have that skill set .,technology
and cia who have that skill set .,technology
and i do not know for certain but i would have if i were a betting person i would bet that there wa some involvement there .,technology
that make perfect sense .,technology
but it also it also speaks to the size and the breadth of this that you have many organization and only one of them ha to have some leak .,technology
a of course occurred many time to sabotage the operation .,technology
the sabotage operation could be sabotaged a . yeah look it is amazing .,technology
they kept it going a long a they kept it going .,technology
i think it wa something that they recognize the value of they realized that it wa very complex .,technology
they did not want to jeopardize it while it wa going on .,technology
and they kept a tight lid on it .,technology
i think look i do not know if this is a known not to get to rumsfeldian but i do not know if this is a it is a known unknown .,technology
i think we do not know or at least i do not .,technology
we do not know how many of these operation never get into the public sphere .,technology
i think the vast majority never get into the public sphere a a reporter .,technology
i it when thing get in the public sphere .,technology
i learning about them .,technology
i think they are fascinating .,technology
i think some of them are i think they are illustrative and important for different reason .,technology
but we do not know .,technology
i spoke to other folk about there have been other sort of these operation that have that have occurred over the year .,technology
i know that much for a fact .,technology
there been some reporting about different operation of this sort targeting iran and north korea much more recently .,technology
and i could say independently that i am aware of stuff on the iranian side but i am very happy that the american system is an open one .,technology
but i also think that i think very little of this stuff ever get out .,technology
yeah i would i would certainly imagine that to be true which is unfortunate for reporter and amateur historian myself .,technology
but it is the nature of the game .,technology
but it certainly help you keep your interest .,technology
i am curious the middleman that you mentioned the unidentified austrian did this turn into him essentially every time he had to go meet the his contact ?,technology
wa he having to apologize for the last shipment ?,technology
to speak hey i am sorry that half of that did not work but i promise we fixed the error .,technology
anything that wa this a and wa the pressure intensifying over time for him a the front man ?,technology
i do not think i think at first thing were going quite smoothly .,technology
i think there wa there wa an expectation that some thing would not .,technology
i think there wa an expectation by the bulgarian and the russian that look there going to be some .,technology
there going to be some room for error when you are when you are running a transnational sanction evasion scheme importing sense of technology. . i think i think that for a while they were quite happy and they got a bunch of stuff .,technology
some of it wa unadulterated and some of the stuff that wa sabotaged i think they did not realize wa sabotaged .,technology
my understanding from rick and others is that they were very very pleased .,technology
and i think most of their i think this this business person is austrian .,technology
i think most of the meeting that they had that he had with the soviet block operative were a neutral terrain ?,technology
switzerland or austria then classic cold war locale .,technology
at some point my understanding is that i think i think one thousand nine hundred and eighty three or they became suspicious and they asked him to meet them in bulgaria behind the iron curtain .,technology
and the austrian told rick and the fbi about the request and the suspicion .,technology
and rick and the bureau said absolutely not .,technology
you are not going and this operation is complete because clearly they had their suspicion about you .,technology
it is not safe for you to go there .,technology
any subsequent shipment would be scrutinized to an extent that it would be clear immediately that something wa wrong .,technology
everything went very very until it went very wrong .,technology
but a far a thing go thats pretty good ?,technology
because their source never went behind the iron curtain and they decided to pull the plug .,technology
and they had a successful run and then they decided that time wa up and the time wa up .,technology
ed appel the former fbi counterintelligence agent from dc who helped run the case .,technology
he waxed philosophical about it in a way that i thought wa interesting .,technology
he said look these thing all have a half life ?,technology
you can not run an operation this forever .,technology
they are complex .,technology
there always these tradeoff .,technology
there always worry about your source .,technology
the opposite side always ha it antenna up .,technology
and he said look these thing they have to end sometime .,technology
and there wa no sense from anybody who ran the operation that the ending wa premature .,technology
it it worked until it wa over. . yeah it sound a pretty successful wrap up overall .,technology
and speaking of the austrian did he stay on the payroll after that to speak ?,technology
or wa that the end of his relationship with the fbi a far a ?,technology
thats it .,technology
a far a i know he worked with them and he helped them out and he got paid a a source .,technology
and he got he wa making money off of these transfer too .,technology
he wa a businessman .,technology
and that wa part of the deal ?,technology
it wa the fbi did not did not seize the profit that he made .,technology
he made a profit working with the soviet bloc and then he wa also being paid by the bureau .,technology
and then of course after the operation ended he could no longer he could no longer engage in an economic intercourse with the soviet bloc because it wa illegal immediately the moment that operation ended .,technology
and he wa no longer being paid by the bureau .,technology
he went back to being a businessman who apparently ended up being a very very successful businessman .,technology
there wa a happy ending for him there too .,technology
yeah it certainly sound it .,technology
and i know that you mentioned in the story a that there wa some concern about him .,technology
and i do not know how founded it wa but the fbi in a sense they had engineered this perfect established black marketeer kingpin guy and then they had to cut him loose .,technology
boy i hope he doesnt use that for himself in the future .,technology
they look they were worried about that and not not him doing that in the future but then also while they were running the operation because they are we can not keep tab on this guy all the time .,technology
we do not know if there are side deal or other thing that he engaged in ?,technology
because we are we are giving him u government cover to engage to trade with the enemy .,technology
and there wa always concern there i do not think it wa ever founded i think it wa i think but nonetheless one human nature two counterintelligence professional can be untrusting paranoid .,technology
it is it is a professional benefit to an extent ?,technology
there a way of looking at the world .,technology
and i think that there wa concern there over time .,technology
and i think there wa probably some relief on the bureau end to say what we wrapped this operation up in a way that it did not blow up in our face .,technology
and there wa never any evidence of this guy double dealing .,technology
did not he do it with libya ?,technology
did not he start selling stuff to libya ?,technology
he wa not fully out of the agency to a certain extent anyway .,technology
pretty murky story there but he definitely realized that what he wa already doing for the u government he could also do a a private citizen and make a heck of a lot more money out of it apparently .,technology
because it is wa he wa he an ex cia officer who wa providing intelligence ?,technology
wa he being tasked by the agency ?,technology
what wa the extent and depth of the relationship ?,technology
wa there any wa there any money ?,technology
wa he a paid source ?,technology
wa he this is a murky world .,technology
and of course these are big issue today too ?,technology
do you have a lot of ex ex cia folk and ex ic folk who go abroad and do work abroad and still maintain some some do not .,technology
i do not the whole there no such thing a an ex cia officer .,technology
thats not true .,technology
but thats thats not true .,technology
emphatically thats not true .,technology
but there is contact between some and there and i think it get very very murky ?,technology
and we had case with i think it wa nsa personnel in the gulf in particular ?,technology
where they are starting to work with foreign government .,technology
and it is but if they are keeping some connection to the usg side it make it brings up ethical issue .,technology
and certainly legal one that that make it very hard to prosecute individual if they have a ongoing relationship with former employer .,technology
on the subject of the soviet and the bulgarian all of them or were they all outside of the u ?,technology
you mentioned the third country neutral ground meeting and all that .,technology
wa there anyone at the end of this to png out of the united state or anything that ?,technology
or did they continue on having lost this battle ?,technology
a far a i understand it the bulgarian intelligence officer around the operation were europe based .,technology
there were bulgarian intelligence officer who were also indicted but i do not think they were ever they were never tried .,technology
but there were bulgarian intelligence officer who were indicted in the very least in southern california .,technology
and i do not think i do not think there were any pngs or arrest of foreign intelligence officer .,technology
the only folk i know who were who were brought to justice in the legal system were i think the folk i previously mentioned the u side folk who were violating export control ban .,technology
but a prosecution is only a small piece of these operation ?,technology
and sometimes it ha no part of it .,technology
sometimes prosecution ha nothing to do with counterintelligence operation and they exist in a different zone entirely .,technology
this one the very fact that there wa any prosecution that arose at all make it i think unusual .,technology
i can not say i am surprised but it is fascinating that folk were charged at all .,technology
yeah this is an incredible story zach .,technology
and you did great work bringing it to light finally after all this time .,technology
for those of you listening if you want to read zachs story well link it up in the show note when this episode come out .,technology
it is on politico.com now .,technology
look for zach dorfmans most recent article .,technology
fascinating stuff zach .,technology
are you already working on something new now ?,technology
whats next on the horizon for you ?,technology
i got multiple thing .,technology
there is a story that ive been working on for year that will be out by monday .,technology
it is in rolling stone magazine .,technology
and i am still still slightly paranoid about talking about it before it is out .,technology
but it is a story about it is a war on terror story essentially .,technology
and it is a story about somebody within cia who did some extraordinary thing and wa fetid for those extraordinary thing but then came home and had some very significant psychological or mental health issue related to the work they did .,technology
and the story is about the work and program that this person engaged in at the agency .,technology
and then also what happened to them when they came back and whether they got the care they needed .,technology
and the larger question surrounding the care and the state of the very specific program that this person wa engaged in .,technology
it is coming out .,technology
it should be out sunday .,technology
by the time people are listening to this it should be out in rolling stone .,technology
and it is a story that i am very very proud of .,technology
it is it is not the easiest reading admittedly .,technology
but i think that it is it is something that if i dare say it i think it is an important story and something that i hope get a conversation going about how we care for folk that do very very difficult deep cover work .,technology
wow zach you certainly know how to set the hook .,technology
i will give you that .,technology
because i am very interested .,technology
i look forward to that .,technology
and then and thats i think thats an incredible accomplishment .,technology
honestly two major major story this on two different subject dropping in a two week period .,technology
thats thats impressive work .,technology
thats pure happenstance .,technology
that is pure happenstance .,technology
that is stuff that these are these story that i have been diligently piecing together for year .,technology
and they happened randomly to appear on back to back weekend .,technology
but these are reporting these out a molasses and then writing them a the same .,technology
i am happy that they are out in the world .,technology
and if you you want to talk about the rolling stone story or any or any other story justin id be more than happy to come back .,technology
yeah fantastic .,technology
thats i will take you up on that definitely because this ha been a great conversation .,technology
and a i wa saying before we started recording ive read a lot of your other reporting and it is certainly up my alley up the listener alley .,technology
i would to dive back into some of your previous work and it sound some of your future work a . i appreciate your time .,technology
and i look forward to this new article and i enjoyed what you wrote a . thank you justin .,technology
my pleasure .,technology

welcome to the consulting technology podcast brought to you by cognacor.com where we explore the intersection of technology consulting and industry challenge .,technology
i am your host john kerr joined a always by our resident expert dr. samuel z. today we are excited to welcome joseph keller a business advisor in the health insurance industry and a specialist in area valuebased care network analytics and claim analytics .,technology
joseph is deeply passionate about making healthcare more accessible and affordable and we are thrilled to have him here to discus ai and healthcare today .,technology
this is our conversation .,technology
joseph thank you for joining u today .,technology
your background in software and data is impressive especially with your focus on reducing healthcare cost and improving access to underserved community .,technology
can you tell u a little bit about what led you down this path in healthcare analytics software development and altruism ?,technology
thanks for having me .,technology
i started out working for a provider and getting the broad business background on how healthcare is financed and what drive strategy from a contracting perspective .,technology
and then when you get to see when you work for a large system you are going to get to see a much more broader point of view in the sense of you are not focused on one small area .,technology
you get to see an entire state or how policy and thing affect the entire country .,technology
and ive done everything from the commercial space to a little bit of the government stuff .,technology
medicare and medicaid most of what ive done is on the commercial side .,technology
and from there i realized that this is ten year ago i realized that compared to some of the tech hub around the united state that healthcare wa definitely definitely in it infancy a far a tool how they process thing the analytics on and forth .,technology
and since then ive seen a lot more investment in creating little software shop within organization .,technology
and naturally that wa something that i wa interested in because one of the big challenge of healthcare is the administrative side of thing how many people you need to do certain kind of task .,technology
and it seemed inevitable that those thing will converge weve seen in software .,technology
when i first started in software we used to have an entire team dedicated to doing release .,technology
and now they call that devops .,technology
people before used to not be full stack developer .,technology
it seemed that thats the natural order of thing that thing will converge .,technology
and i thought there wa some interesting opportunity to be creative and create thing from the ground up .,technology
joe in particular why do you think the healthcare industry ha been slower than other industry to adopt say analytics ?,technology
we know obviously ai there regulatory reason and thing that around ai a . but a an industry why do you think healthcare is generally slower to adopt emerging technology and say other industry ?,technology
the easiest thing to point to is electronic health record .,technology
it wasnt a mandate until i think eight or nine .,technology
if you compare that to banking or other industry that have been doing it since the 80 or 90 it is not a part of the normal day to day when we are thinking about data and what is the data say .,technology
health insurance company i think have been doing it a little longer than say provider .,technology
and because they are bigger when you are talking about a fortune forty company they are talking about million and million of provider where a big system in a state is not even anywhere near that .,technology
electronic health record definitely have played a piece into it .,technology
and then the skill set ?,technology
a technology ha emerged in the last twenty twenty five year the top talent doesnt think of how they want to go into healthcare .,technology
they think i want to go on wall street .,technology
i want to make facebook or whatever .,technology
and naturally it is been slow .,technology
those two thing converging electronic health record still be in the beginning the talent .,technology
and then probably the data itself a lot of stuff how claim get adjudicated the data thats there different system how they talk to each other .,technology
historically speaking there been a lot of those merger and claim engine and whatnot they do thing differently .,technology
and there hasnt been an integration to look at a a billion dollar level company to streamline that data .,technology
the data is very messy ha a lot of gap .,technology
and it is very hard to do analytics .,technology
not only that with the regulation and behavior you can predict much easier to say if you put an item on a shelf more people are going to look at that .,technology
with healthcare you do not know when people are going to be sick .,technology
it is not a binary a retail sale or i to use the analogy of a car how do when your car is going to break down ?,technology
it break down when it break down .,technology
healthcare is difficult in that sense that you are dealing with many different thing that can happen in the body .,technology
and from an analytics point of view how do you relate that to some economic strategy ?,technology
it is it is it is difficult .,technology
would you say that the economics of it being that it is not well always you look at historically at least area entertainment often get huge investment from venture capital and thing this because in the short term there no cap on how much money it can make ?,technology
you do not usually see public good entity getting the same investment or the same attention from investor .,technology
do you think that the purely the economics of say healthcare drive that slower adoption of emerging technology ?,technology
your question is do the economics create a barrier for healthcare company to adopt those technology ?,technology
yeah are there a lot of startup healthcare technology in term of sheer number say compared to video game or gambling or streaming or something this where it doe seem always there another one of those company always being funded ?,technology
i do not at least my knowledge i do not see the same growth in the healthcare space or these other industry .,technology
yeah it is definitely a huge barrier to entry .,technology
and then if you think about some of the largest company in the world a lot of them are insurance company .,technology
how do you become a facebook and take on i think some of the bigger publicly traded company are in the three to five hundred billion in revenue .,technology
i guess it is not an easy thing to disrupt .,technology
whereas creating a game or betting is more about how do you get eyeball on something ?,technology
the economics are different and definitely more challenging from a healthcare point of view in term of vc .,technology
if i wa a vc i would maybe yeah thats a tough one .,technology
maybe yeah maybe the economics are difficult .,technology
i do not know that space enough .,technology
i know there company out there now they are there they have their own investment side of thing where they are investing in startup .,technology
at the rate of new company being started maybe it is maybe it is a smaller smaller thing .,technology
or there were much more low hanging fruit with video game in term of the roi .,technology
and now they are starting to maybe move on to something more interesting or difficult .,technology
in term of ai in particular is there any common or cultural fear you get when talking to leader ?,technology
in the healthcare space around ai ?,technology
is there any either cultural element to it or emotional element that are that are where leader particularly in the healthcare space or the healthcare insurance space that are skeptical of ai or thing this ?,technology
or how are when you discus this with leader how are they reacting ?,technology
they are definitely very careful and very risk adverse because because of any data or anything ai related .,technology
it is impacting people .,technology
and the law that are surrounded around it the hip of compliance and thing that .,technology
they are very more careful about how they go about figuring out strategy .,technology
it is definitely baby step because of all those constraint .,technology
in term of the constraint that you are dealing with you think that it is a more of a regulatory constraint say for example hipaa ?,technology
or do you think that it is something different maybe it is more of an economic constraint or a cultural constraint ?,technology
or is it more of the issue of the economics do not encourage the adoption of these emerging technology ?,technology
i wouldnt say the government necessarily creates slows down the desire .,technology
there definitely a huge desire .,technology
it is more understanding the value proposition and doe it increase in efficiency or lower the balance sheet ?,technology
it ha to make dollar and cent .,technology
and to change that could be a huge operational risk because it could be slow .,technology
i to point always back to the labor .,technology
labor may be a little bit more adverse to changing how they want to do thing .,technology
how is ai going to do it ?,technology
the adoption there can be tricky .,technology
and then it is very expensive .,technology
their provider business model is not in software development .,technology
they have a brick and mortar hospital or an office .,technology
and to add software and ai into that is completely outside of their normal skill set .,technology
for an insurance company i think it is a challenge to find the talent in order to solve certain business problem .,technology
the business problem can be tricky because the data is not super intuitive to understand .,technology
everybody can understand how clicking and retail sale can work on the healthcare side of thing .,technology
it can be challenging .,technology
and then from a doctor point of view i think there a battle between old school and new school on adoptability .,technology
wheres the liability ?,technology
if i am a dermatologist and i am using scan and a report from an ai tool am i making the decision ?,technology
or is the doctor making the decision ?,technology
is the tool augmenting in helping them do that ?,technology
and if how doe that relate to dollar and cent ?,technology
is a doctor going to pay more for this tool ?,technology
they went to medical school .,technology
is the insurance company going to make money by providing this tool ?,technology
that mean that they have to get a discount .,technology
the doctor not going to take le money .,technology
there may be a lot of good idea .,technology
they may not add up to some dollar and cent at the end of the day .,technology
and most of the tool that i see are operational efficiency trying to figure out how to lower the drag of processing claim or internally how to make sure thing get routed to the person .,technology
and those are the low hanging fruit a of now .,technology
i recently saw a thread on reddit .,technology
they have a subreddit called ama .,technology
it mean ask me anything .,technology
and the team from chatgpt joined sometime last week .,technology
and they did one for the big launch of chatgpt4o .,technology
i think somebody whod cured themselves of a rare illness by being able to diagnose themselves when the doctor hadnt noticed it .,technology
i wondered if you had seen any interesting application of ai in health care or health insurance that youd to share ?,technology
on medicine itself i think there a lot more opportunity in term of research whether you are talking about cancer or assisting people in their own diagnosis behavior health mental health .,technology
i think those are more interesting avenue .,technology
we did get microsoft come in and show u how they are using it in some medical research .,technology
and it seemed promising of some of the finding that they were able to do with the human eye .,technology
with ai being able to look at all kind of different variable simultaneously i think grandmaster chest people have eight or ten variable in their head .,technology
and if with ai you can throw that much more data and ask the gpt to give some insight and then tweak it .,technology
and there were more thing from the research side .,technology
i think pharmaceutical speaking that can definitely help out .,technology
and a processing get cheaper that what that translates to is cheaper drug lower cost for the consumer .,technology
and i think there a very clear economic formula there for medicine itself .,technology
operationally i think there opportunity too a i wa mentioning about claim and making sure thing get done quicker paying correctly that thing .,technology
and then a far a the medicine i know they are doing thing with estimating when someone likely going to have a heart attack .,technology
maybe that help the patient have a light bulb moment where they say i need to change my behavior .,technology
i do not think that that will necessarily translate very easily to see there cost saving .,technology
in the value based care space they look at thing to say hey doctor if you diagnose keep on track of people who have diabetes or these kind of risk this is more valuable .,technology
what thats supposed to do then is translate to lower cost and lower saving or more saving .,technology
the question is who realizing those saving and what are we saying when we say the cost are going down ?,technology
from a doctor point of view they are saying hey i did something more valuable you should pay me more .,technology
thats not saving anybody any money if the doctor is having to get paid more .,technology
me a a consumer i have to pay more in a premium .,technology
and a a health plan that mean i am going to have to charge more to my customer .,technology
the tricky part is then is where is the risk ?,technology
is the risk on the doctor ?,technology
because if their patient then seem to have more problem at some point maybe one or two or three year down the road do they get le money ?,technology
is it on the consumer side to say hey if you do not do these thing then we are going to price your health at a different premium ?,technology
thats not discussed widely but that is a consideration when designing product .,technology
and then from the health plan side of thing they are using it a more of a payment mechanism to say hey well increase your payment but we are going to tie it a more of an incentive bonus .,technology
and we are not going to guarantee the increase unless we see some certain kind of result and outcome and measuring .,technology
and you have that component and then you have the infrastructure behind the scene .,technology
you have team of fifty to one hundred people monitoring and developing report and methodology .,technology
and you are wheres the real saving coming from ?,technology
it is a challenge because it is not clear that you would have saved money had you done something else because thats more of a different reality that we measure against .,technology
the saving it is hard for an accountant to look at where the saving hit the balance sheet .,technology
and those are why valuebased care ha faded especially since covid .,technology
many of our listener are in the consulting space or they are in a talent management space and thing this .,technology
in regard to the health care industry broadly particularly for folk in the technology space though one of the growing sector we are seeing a lot in the consulting space now is a data governance area or some regulatory data analyst or regulatory data expert thing this .,technology
is that a particular area of growth you think in the health care industry is the job of the data governance expert or the legal data expert or something that ?,technology
you are given the large amount of regulation in the health care space ?,technology
i think governance would be more internally .,technology
when you have large organization you need to figure out how you are going to sell something how you are going to market something how you are going to implement something and then the data strategy behind that .,technology
the governance come from more when these request are made .,technology
do you have enough resource and capacity to a intake all those request and then b to then figure out how to prioritize them ?,technology
because you can not spend ... you only have much money to spend you have to figure out way of prioritizing that .,technology
and then from there then once the implementation go live then you need to be able to track and monitor it .,technology
believe it or not there not a lot of infrastructure in place to even create a ... to create visibility into how the business is performing .,technology
i wa asked one time a long time ago about if we had data to measure how effective request were to join a product something that something a product or did they join this thing ?,technology
and i said yeah did you guy send it out and have a way of tracking and creating that data ?,technology
and they were no we thought based on the claim youd be able to tell me that .,technology
and i am the claim doesnt have anything related to this flyer that you sent out. ?,technology
and thinking about how data is created to then measuring it on the back end that end to end thing is very sporadic depending upon the organization you talk about or have experience with .,technology
these same consultant who are say looking to work with healthcare organization healthcare insurance organization group this or provide service to these organization what are the primary skill set that these organization are looking to get from their consultant or from their external third party ?,technology
is it more technical skill ?,technology
is it more of the relationship building of a long term relationship ?,technology
where would you put that the skill are needed now ?,technology
i think it is more getting competitor data trying to understand where they are positioned and where they are not .,technology
it could be it could be when you are talking about evaluating doctor or health system who is high quality ?,technology
what doe that mean ?,technology
can we be objective ?,technology
do we have a large enough sample to be pretty confident and to have result that we can measure against ?,technology
a lot of time organization can only look inward .,technology
they can say based on what we have thats not necessarily representative of the entire market or the geography thats being discussed .,technology
there are a lot of company out there that become data broker essentially .,technology
and they have to be very good and be able to sell their story a lot better by saying we are we do know what we are talking about .,technology
we have these certification of quality et cetera .,technology
thats the challenge for consultant and organization to make those decision .,technology
in term of the fact that many healthcare organization often either have a nonprofit bent to them or they are heavily regulated they have some other funding bent to them thing this .,technology
is there any particular adoption or way to accelerate say ai adoption in this space ?,technology
from the government point of view thats a little bit outside of my expertise .,technology
maybe they could use it to figure out how they reimburse .,technology
because government program are funded based on tax they see a trend for service go up they adjust the payment based on that .,technology
that could be helpful in figuring out are they spreading the money across the entire state or in case of medicare appropriately ?,technology
should they pas legislation to require more access and would there be a way of figuring out if they could help folk that are retired or folk that are under the poverty level ?,technology
maybe those are the play .,technology
i do not have much experience with that .,technology
what conversation are people having about ai around you at the moment ?,technology
is it still very novel or are they picking up the pace or complexity ?,technology
what is the opinion of ai in the workplace ?,technology
i think it is conversation are definitely accelerating and there is a heavy interest and a heavy investment in it .,technology
it might be a little shortsighted in the sense that i think ultimately what the play is for large organization is to give people tool to either make them more productive making sure that they are not wasting time doing other thing that are otherwise unproductive .,technology
and also to not have to rely on a much on the labor talent .,technology
if they can develop tool that can allow people to do thing quicker and faster then more governance job other thing would other type of role would be created to support those thing to support the business .,technology
and i think thats thats how i only thats the only way i see it working is tempering the liability on the balance sheet a far a labor .,technology
one of the thing i read a lot about is how generative ai can be adopted in regulated industry .,technology
and healthcare is usually one of the main one we hear about .,technology
in term of say analyst engineer it professional who work in healthcare work in healthcare analytics and healthcare insurance and thing this do you think that these professional will be able to adopt generative ai a part of their job anytime soon ?,technology
or hipaa is the number one thing i hear about is that if they have a data set theyd to analyze but it is full of healthcare data they can not give this to an ai ?,technology
and to say hey i am an upload a data set and ask you question about it ?,technology
or ask for recommendation in term of either procedure or medical advice or thing that based on the data set you upload because the data set themselves are often either not deidentified they have a lot of sensitive private information in them .,technology
do in the coming year that this problem will be solved or were you think that these analyst these engineer who work in the healthcare space will they be able to use generative ai and give these system patient data or at least patient related data at some point ?,technology
i think they do already .,technology
it is more of a tool than a full automation to have it do thing .,technology
and whether it be on the claim side making sure that thing get routed correctly finding claim are complicated and not complicated .,technology
the idea is is i see this i should measure it against what the expectation payment is and then pay it .,technology
a lot of time thing will be missing information thats needed or the claim engine will flag thing .,technology
and who doe that go to ?,technology
how doe it how doe the transaction back and forth with the with the provider ?,technology
how doe that work ?,technology
and the tool would be to look at that operational process and make sure that the generative ai know where to send thing be able to explain very in plain simple english what the issue is .,technology
and i see generative ai being a being helpful in that sense of speeding up the claim turnaround and then being able to articulate in either plain english or some way thats intuitive not in order to make sure that that thing are being processed correctly .,technology
thank you .,technology
and before we wrap up the show this is the moment where we get our crystal ball out and try to look forward into the future .,technology
i wa wondering if you had any opinion or idea about change that you might anticipate over the next five year .,technology
are there any indicator or signal about a specific direction thing might be heading ?,technology
a it relates to healthcare what would be what would be amazing is if the transparency side of thing i think president trump signed some legislation in there .,technology
i think it would be better for the consumer not necessarily better for the business if they were able to understand and have an expectation about what certain thing would cost until you have a child you do not know what your how your product work .,technology
and it would be nice to have a tool to say hey based on this provider that i am thinking about going to how much would it cost me to have a baby based on my current deductible and and all the thing that are involved .,technology
and i think that would be interesting to for people to get more involved in understanding about i am curious maybe i should get a ct scan to make sure i am almost forty and maybe thats a good thing .,technology
and then all of a sudden you are it is going to cost me eight hundred .,technology
maybe thats not necessary .,technology
i think from those point if you are getting the customer more engaged would be the best thing .,technology
and i think gen ai can simplify some of those those hurdle .,technology
thank you .,technology
if you were asked by the healthcare company or key stakeholder that were perhaps a bit reluctant to move towards ai and you had an opportunity to convince them or you had an opportunity to fight in it corner what would you say to them ?,technology
say if you are if you are adverse to change it is coming the biggest company out there they see they see the benefit and they are actively spending mega dollar to figure it out .,technology
and you are either going to get smaller or get or get bought if you do not adopt .,technology
this is a very interesting conversation .,technology
thank you for speaking with today joe .,technology
i think healthcare pose a particularly interesting environment for emerging technology given the constraint .,technology
it is not a linear process of we improve the product we get more return on our investment maybe some other industry are .,technology
it ha this very multiple actor have staked in this and they do not necessarily have the same motivation which i think is very interesting .,technology
and that pose a particular challenge from a network effect standpoint on the adoption of emerging technology .,technology
yeah that is that is the challenge in this country insurance company provider and customer are all have very different motivation .,technology
and even across the same insurance company they have different motivation because they are positioned differently same with provider .,technology
if you are very big you are going to behave very differently than if you are very small .,technology
and even one that are similar size .,technology
to get everybody to agree on simple thing is a lot harder than people understand and realize .,technology
and unfortunately it is about dollar and cent .,technology
and to go back to the car analogy ?,technology
how do you how do you keep car repair a cheap a possible ?,technology
is the mechanic responsible for it ?,technology
thats the doctor .,technology
is the owner of the vehicle ?,technology
how much respond ?,technology
how responsible are they ?,technology
and on top of that beyond the car analogy we are talking about people that have to deal with life and death situation .,technology
and the way the industry is incentivized is to deal with the problem a they come instead of try to prevent that .,technology
and how do you shift the economics from that model to something else given the complexity of the environment ?,technology
it make it it make it make it interesting on a day to day basis .,technology
thank you much for sharing your insight with u today .,technology
it is clear you are passionate about your position on your linkedin page .,technology
it say working with a smile .,technology
i would love to give that a recommendation a tick definitely working with a smile .,technology
i wanted to express my gratitude for you joining u on the consulting technology podcast today .,technology
it is been a pleasure .,technology
and good luck with your future endeavor .,technology
thank you very much joseph for being here today .,technology
i think our listener appreciate the insight into adoption emerging technology in the healthcare space and particularly the critical issue it ha regarding the different stakeholder and the different priority they have .,technology
it is very interesting .,technology
i think to our listener both in the should be in the business world who are working for major company but also from a consulting standpoint i think there a lot of key issue here that consultant can definitely bring up .,technology
and thats going to deal with healthcare provider .,technology

thank you .,technology
all everybody welcome to another deep dive .,technology
today we are tackling a topic that quite honestly sends shiver down the spine of anyone who ever touched a computer .,technology
this one a doozy .,technology
we are talking ransomware but with a twist .,technology
buckle up because this deep dive take u straight into the heart of a major cybersecurity vulnerability that rocked the very foundation of the digital backup world .,technology
hit the nail on the head there .,technology
this is a story about trust or rather what happens when that trust is shattered because at the center of it all is veeam a name synonymous with data protection relied upon by business big and small across the globe .,technology
and when a company veeam known for safeguarding our digital kingdom reveals a critical vulnerability it is time to pay attention .,technology
and this is not some theoretical threat we are talking about .,technology
this vulnerability officially designated a cve two thousand and twenty four four.seven wa actively exploited by multiple ransomware gang before a patch even existed .,technology
wait hold on .,technology
they knew about this weakness and were already using it against unsuspecting business ?,technology
it is a stark reminder that in the digital world there are force constantly probing searching for any crack in our defense .,technology
let break this down for everyone .,technology
what exactly wa this veeam vulnerability and how did it potentially expose business to ransomware attack ?,technology
in the simplest term imagine someone handing over the key to your backup fold .,technology
thats essentially what this flaw allowed .,technology
hacker could exploit it remotely gaining unauthorized access to a company entire backup infrastructure .,technology
even if you had all your data neatly backed up thinking you were protected these guy could waltz in and either steal it or hold it hostage .,technology
thats exactly why this particular vulnerability is alarming .,technology
ransomware at it core relies on fear and leverage .,technology
it cripple your access to critical data and then demand a hefty ransom for it release .,technology
and backup are supposed to be our safety net in these situation ?,technology
our way to say no thanks to these digital extortionist .,technology
but when that safety net is compromised the whole game change .,technology
suddenly business are left with an impossible choice .,technology
they are pay up or face the prospect of losing invaluable data potentially crippling their operation .,technology
thats a terrifying position to be in .,technology
weve got business big and small trusting veeam with our data completely unaware that this vulnerability could leave them wide open to attack .,technology
and what make it even scarier is that the attacker exploiting this werent your run of the mill hacker .,technology
we are talking sophisticated organized ransomware gang .,technology
the kind with resource and know how to slip past even the toughest offense .,technology
this is already sounding a cyber thriller movie and i am not sure i the plot .,technology
unfortunately this is the reality we live in and this veeam vulnerability is a stark reminder of how high the stake are .,technology
these ransomware gang they are not some teenager in a basement ?,technology
these are the pro .,technology
we are talking about highly organized often multinational criminal enterprise .,technology
theyve got the resource theyve got the expertise and honestly it is scary how they operate with almost a business efficiency .,technology
i wa going to say it is their business model is built on exploiting these weakness and preying on fear .,technology
exactly theyve honed their tactic constantly adapting to new defense and yeah sadly they are incredibly effective at what they do .,technology
knowing that these are the player involved what doe this mean for business who maybe because of this veeam vulnerability find themselves staring down the barrel of a ransomware attack ?,technology
the first thing that come to mind is the financial hit ?,technology
those ransom demand can be massive sometimes hundred of thousand even million of dollar .,technology
and for some business that alone could be crippling .,technology
without a doubt especially for smaller business that financial blow it could be absolutely devastating .,technology
but it is not about the ransom itself ?,technology
there a whole domino effect that come with a ransomware attack .,technology
you are absolutely .,technology
you hit the nail on the head .,technology
think about it .,technology
business are forced to halt operation their system are down they can not serve customer they can not process order .,technology
it is hitting a giant pause button on their entire operation .,technology
and the longer that pause button is held down the more the loss pile up .,technology
you are getting it .,technology
the financial impact it spiral outwards lost revenue missed deadline potential legal fee reputational damage .,technology
it is a nightmare scenario .,technology
reputational damage yeah thats a whole other beast ?,technology
it is once trust is broken it is incredibly hard to rebuild .,technology
it is .,technology
in today hyperconnected world news of a data breach spread wildfire .,technology
customer partner investor they all start questioning your security practice .,technology
and rightfully .,technology
if i heard a company i do business with got hit by ransomware id definitely think twice .,technology
and rebuilding that trust it take time it take transparency and it take a serious commitment to bolstering your cybersecurity posture .,technology
the picture you are tainting it is not pretty .,technology
but let try and shift gear a bit .,technology
veeam did release a patch patch twelve.two to be specific to address this vulnerability .,technology
thats the immediate action everyone should take if you are using veeam update your system yesterday .,technology
yeah thats got to be step one for sure .,technology
but i think it is important to emphasize that patching alone it is not a magic bullet .,technology
it is locking your front door .,technology
it is a good start but it is not going to stop a determined burglar .,technology
exactly you need a multilayered security approach a combination of proactive measure and reactive strategy to protect yourself .,technology
we are talking layer of security a digital fortress if you will .,technology
what are some of the building block we need to consider here ?,technology
a good place to start is access control .,technology
it is having a strict bouncer at the door of your data center .,technology
you got to make sure only authorized personnel have access to your critical system especially your backup infrastructure .,technology
strong password ridiculously long one with all the weird character those are nonnegotiables ?,technology
strong and unique password are a must but we can not stop there .,technology
this is where multifactor authentication come in .,technology
the twofactor thing ?,technology
where you need a code from your phone or email on top of your password ?,technology
it add that extra layer of security making it exponentially harder for attacker to gain unauthorized access even if they somehow manage to snag your password .,technology
because then they need your phone too and good luck getting past my lock screen .,technology
it is all about making it a difficult a possible for the bad guy forcing them to expend more time and resource and hopefully making them reconsider altogether .,technology
weve got our fortress wall our multifactor moat .,technology
what else can we do to beef up our defense ?,technology
do not set it and forget it .,technology
youve got to keep an eye on thing .,technology
actively monitor your system and backup log for any sign of suspicious activity unauthorized access attempt anything out of the ordinary .,technology
having security camera and motion sensor but for our digital asset ?,technology
thats a great analogy .,technology
think of it a an early warning system giving you a chance to react quickly and potentially mitigate damage if something fishy is going on .,technology
i am seeing the importance of staying vigilant .,technology
but even with all these precaution sometimes those worst case scenario they still happen ?,technology
thats where that disaster recovery plan come in .,technology
no system is foolproof no matter how many layer of security you have in place .,technology
thats why having a solid disaster recovery plan is crucial .,technology
it is having an insurance policy for your data .,technology
and this plan it is not about saying yeah well figure it out if something happens .,technology
it is got to be detailed ?,technology
you need a clear stepbystep plan outlining exactly what to do in case of a ransomware attack or any major disruption .,technology
how will you restore your data ?,technology
how will you communicate with your employee your customer the authority ?,technology
these are all thing you need to have figured out beforehand .,technology
because in the heat of the moment thats not the time to be scrambling trying to make decision under pressure .,technology
a rehearsed disaster recovery plan it can be the difference between a minor inconvenience and a businessending catastrophe .,technology
solid advice .,technology
now i have heard a lot about this threetwoone backup rule .,technology
something tell me thats got to be part of this disaster recovery plan .,technology
you are absolutely on the track .,technology
the threetwoone rule it is the golden rule of data protection and for good reason .,technology
all for those of u who might have missed that memo break down the threetwoone rule for u . picture this .,technology
you have three copy of your data ?,technology
your primary copy the one you are working on and two backup .,technology
those two backup they should be stored on two different type of medium .,technology
one on an external hard drive and the other maybe in the cloud ?,technology
thats the two part of the rule .,technology
and here come the one at least one of those backup .,technology
probably the one on that external drive should be stored offline completely disconnected from your network .,technology
even if hacker managed to breach your main system and your online backup that offline copy it is your trump card .,technology
think of it a your data escape pod .,technology
safely tucked away ready to bring thing back online if the unthinkable happens .,technology
wow thats a comforting thought ive got to say .,technology
this ha been incredibly insightful .,technology
i think weve all learned a thing or two today about the importance of robust cybersecurity especially in light of this veeam vulnerability .,technology
this incident it serf a a stark wake up call for everyone .,technology
regardless of the size of your business the sensitivity of your data cybersecurity is not something you can afford to ignore .,technology
and it is not a one time fix ?,technology
it is an ongoing process of staying informed adapting to new threat and making sure your defense are up to par .,technology
always be learning always be adapting and never underestimate the importance of a good backup and recovery plan .,technology
on that note i think it is time for u to wrap up another deep dive .,technology
to everyone listening stay safe out there and remember knowledge is your best defense in the ever evolving landscape of cybersecurity .,technology
the following is a conversation with stephen wolfram his third time on the podcast .,technology
he a computer scientist mathematician theoretical physicist and the founder of wolfram research a company behind mathematica wolfram alpha wolfram language and the new wolfram physic project .,technology
this conversation is a wild technical rollercoaster ride through topic of complexity mathematics physic computing and consciousness .,technology
i think this is what this podcast is becoming a wild ride .,technology
some episode are about physic some about robot some are about war and power some are about the human condition and our search for meaning and some are what the comedian tim dylan call fun .,technology
this is the lex friedman podcast .,technology
to support it please check out the sponsor in the description .,technology
and now here my conversation with stephen wolfram .,technology
almost twenty year ago you published the new science where you presented a study of complexity and an approach from modeling of complex system .,technology
let u return again to the core idea of complexity .,technology
what is complexity ?,technology
i do not know i think thats not the most interesting question .,technology
it is if you ask a biologist what is life ?,technology
thats not the question they care the most about .,technology
what i wa interested in is how doe something that we would usually identify a complexity arise in nature ?,technology
i got interested in that question fifty year ago which is embarrassing a long time ago .,technology
and i wa how doe snowflake get to have complicated form ?,technology
how to galaxy get to have complicated shape ?,technology
how doe how do living system get produced ?,technology
thing that ?,technology
and the question is whats the underlying scientific basis for those kind of thing ?,technology
and the thing that i wa at first very surprised by because ive been doing physic some particle physic some fancy mathematical physic and on and it is i know all this fancy stuff .,technology
i should be able to solve this basic science question .,technology
and i couldnt .,technology
this wa early maybe one thousand nine hundred and eightyish time frame .,technology
and it is what can one do to understand the basic secret that nature seems to have ?,technology
because seems nature you look around in the natural world it is full of incredibly complicated form .,technology
you look at most engineered kind of thing for instance they tend to be we got circle and line and thing this .,technology
and the question is what secret doe nature have that let it make all this complexity that we in doing engineering for example do not naturally seem to have ?,technology
and that wa the the thing that i got interested in .,technology
and then the question wa could i understand that with thing mathematical physic ?,technology
then work very .,technology
then i got to thinking about is there some other way to try to understand this ?,technology
and then the question wa if you are going to look at some system in nature how do you make a model for that system for what that system doe ?,technology
a model is some abstract representation of the system some formal representation of the system .,technology
what is the raw material that you can make that model out of ?,technology
and what i realized wa program are good source of raw material for making model of thing .,technology
and in term of my personal history to me that seemed obvious .,technology
and the notion of let try and make model by starting from computational primitive and seeing what we can build up .,technology
that seemed a obvious thing to do .,technology
in retrospect it might not have been externally quite obvious but it wa obvious to me at the time given the path that i happened to have been on .,technology
that got me into this question of let use program to model what happens in nature .,technology
and the question then is what program ?,technology
and we are used to program that you write for some particular purpose and to be a long piece of code and it doe some specific thing .,technology
but what i got interested in wa if you go out into the computational universal possible program you say take the simplest program you can imagine what doe it do ?,technology
and i started studying these thing called cellular automaton .,technology
i did not know it first .,technology
they were called cellular automaton but i found that out subsequently but it is a line of cell each one is black or white .,technology
and it is some rule that say the color of the cell is determined by the color that had on previous step and it is two neighbor on previous step .,technology
and i had initially thought that sufficiently simple set up is not going to do anything interesting .,technology
it is always going to be simple no complexity simple rule simple behavior .,technology
but then i ran the computer experiment which is pretty easy to do .,technology
probably took a few hour originally .,technology
and the result were not what i expected at all .,technology
now needle to say in the way that science work .,technology
the result that i got a lot of unexpected thing which i thought were interesting but the strongest which wa already there in the printout i made .,technology
i did not understand for a couple more year .,technology
it wa not the compressed version of the story is you run the experiment and you immediately see whats going on but i wasnt smart enough to do that to speak .,technology
but the big the big thing is even with very simple rule of that type the minimal tiniest program the one line program or something it is possible to get very complicated behavior .,technology
my favorite example is the thing called rule thirty which is a particular cell error or tomaton rule you started off from one black cell and it make this complicated pattern .,technology
and that for me wa a critical discovery that then said playing back on to how doe nature make complexity ?,technology
i realized that might be how it doe it .,technology
that might be the secret that it is using is that in this computational universe of possible program it is pretty easy to get program where even though the program is simple the behavior when you run the program is not simple at all .,technology
and that wa for me that wa the the story of how that that wa the the indication that one had got an idea of what the secret that nature us to make complexity and that complexity how complexity can be made in other place .,technology
now if you say what is complexity ?,technology
it is complexity is it is not easy to tell whats going on .,technology
thats the informal version of what is complexity .,technology
but there is something going on .,technology
but thats a rule .,technology
what ? .,technology
no the rule can generate randomness. . thats not obvious .,technology
in other word thats not obvious at all. . and it wasnt what i expected .,technology
it is not what people intuition had been and ha been for a long time .,technology
that is why one might think you have a rule you can tell there a rule behind it .,technology
it is the early robot and science fiction movie but you can tell it is a robot because it doe simple things. . turn out that is not the story .,technology
but it is not obvious that is not the story because people assume simple rule simple behavior .,technology
and that the the key discovery about the computational universe is that is not true .,technology
and that discovery go very deep and relates to all kind of thing that ive spent year and year studying .,technology
but in the end the the the what is complexity is you can not easily tell what it is going to do .,technology
you could run the rule and see what happens .,technology
but you can not say show me the rule .,technology
i know whats going to happen .,technology
and the key phenomenon around that is this thing i call computational irreducibility .,technology
this fact that in something rule thirty you might say whats going to do after a million step ?,technology
you can run it for a million step and do what it doe to find out .,technology
but you can not compress that .,technology
you can not reduce that and say i am going to be able to jump ahead and say this is what it is going to do after a million step .,technology
but i do not have to go through anything that computational effort .,technology
by the way ha anybody succeeded that ?,technology
you had a challenge a competition. . for predicting the middle column of rule thirty and but eat anybody .,technology
a number of people have sent thing in and people are picking away at it .,technology
but it is hard .,technology
it is it is ive been ive been even proving that the santa column of rule thirty doesnt repeat .,technology
thats something i think might be doable. . mathematically proving .,technology
and thats analogous to a similar thing the digit of pi which are also generated in this very deterministic way .,technology
and a question is how random of the digit of pi ?,technology
for example doe every first of all doe the digit of pi have a repeat ?,technology
we know they do not because it wa proved in the 1800s that pi is not a rational number .,technology
that mean only rational number have digit sequence that repeat .,technology
we know the digit of pi do not repeat .,technology
another question is doe one hundred and twenty three or whatever they are all the digit based tunnel based tool however you work it out to they all occur with equal frequency .,technology
thats far away from what can be understood mathematically at this point .,technology
and thats thats but i am i am even looking for step one which is prove that the santa column doesnt repeat .,technology
and then prove other thing about it a redistribution of equal number of zero and 1 . and those are thing which i i set up a little little rise thing because i thought those were not not not too out of range .,technology
those are thing which are within a modest amount of time it is conceivable that those could be done .,technology
they are not they are not far away from what current mathematics might allow .,technology
theyll require a bunch of cleverness and hopefully some interesting new idea that will be useful of place .,technology
but you started in one thousand nine hundred and eighty with this idea before i think you realized this idea of program .,technology
you start that there might be some thermodynamic randomness and then complexity come from a clever filter that you i do not know spaghetti or something .,technology
you you you you filter the randomness and outcome complexity which is an interesting intuition .,technology
how do we know thats not whats happening ?,technology
because you were then able to develop look you do not need this incredible randomness you can have very simple predictable initial condition and predictable rule and that from that in my complexity still there might be some system where it is filtering randomness and the input .,technology
the point is when you have quote randomness then the input that mean there all kind of information in the input .,technology
and in a sense what you get out will be maybe something close to what you put in .,technology
people are very in dynamical system theory bigger mathematics that developed from the early 1900s and got big in the 1980s an example of what people study there lot and it is popular version is chaos theory .,technology
an example of what people study a lot is the shift map which is taking two x mod one two at the fractional part of two x which is taking digit and binary and shifting them to the left .,technology
at every step you get to see if you say how big is this number that i got out ?,technology
the most important digit in that number is whatever ended up at the left hand end .,technology
but now if you start off from an arbitrary random number which is quote random we chosen all it digit around them then when you run that chaos theory shift map all that you get out is whatever you put in .,technology
you get to see what you are what to it is not obvious that you would excavate all of those digit .,technology
it is almost explaining if that phenomenon is an important thing .,technology
it is telling you that the fluid dynamic which describes fluid a continuous medium and on is not .,technology
a you do not have that issue you do not have to argue about wa that something complicated put in because plainly obviously there wasnt now .,technology
a a practical matter in doing experiment the big thing is if the thing is complex and reproducible then it did not come from filtering some quote randomness from the outside world .,technology
is it possible to for sure know that our universe doe not at the fundamental level have randomness ?,technology
is it possible to conclusively say there no randomness at the bottom ?,technology
it is an interesting question .,technology
science natural science is an inductive business ?,technology
you observe a bunch of thing and you say can we fit these together ?,technology
what is our hypothesis for whats going on ?,technology
the thing that i think i can say fairly definitively is at this point we understand enough about fundamental physic that there is if there wa an extra dice being thrown it is something that doesnt need to be there .,technology
we can get what we see without that .,technology
now could you add that in a an extra little featurewide without breaking the universe probably but in fact almost certainly yes but is it necessary for understanding the universe ?,technology
no and i think from a more fundamental point of view it is it is i think i might be able to argue .,technology
one of the thing that ive been interested in been pretty surprised that ive had anything sent in to say about is the question of why doe the universe exist ?,technology
i did not think that wa a question that i would i thought that wa a far out there metaphysical thing even the philosopher have stayed away from that question for the most part .,technology
it is such a difficult to address question but i think to my great surprise that from our physic project and on that it is possible to address that question and explain why the universe exists .,technology
and i have a suspicion .,technology
ive not thought it through .,technology
i have a suspicion that that explanation will eventually show you that in no meaningful sense can there be randomness underneath the universe ?,technology
that is that if there is it is something that is necessarily irrelevant to our perception of the universe .,technology
that is that it could be there but doesnt matter because in a sense weve already whatever it would do whatever extra thing it would add is not relevant to our perception of whats going on .,technology
why doe the universe exist ?,technology
how doe the irrelevant randomness connect to the big why question of the universe ?,technology
why doe the universe exist ?,technology
let see and it is the only universe weve got .,technology
it is the only one .,technology
about that time pretty sure .,technology
now maybe which one which of these topic is better to enter first ?,technology
why doe the universe exist and why you think it is the only one that exists ?,technology
and i think the let me let me describe a little bit about the white is the universe existence question .,technology
the main issue is let say you have a model for the universe .,technology
and you say ive got this this program or something and you run it and you make the universe .,technology
now you say how do you act why is that program running ?,technology
and people say youve got this program that make the universe what computer is it running on ?,technology
what doe it mean ?,technology
what actualizes something ?,technology
two plus two equal four but thats different from saying there two a pile of two rock and another pile of two rock and many move them together and make four to speak .,technology
and what is it that turn it from being this formal thing to being something that is actualized ? .,technology
there we have to start thinking about what do we know about whats going on in the universe ?,technology
we are observer of this universe but confusingly enough we are part of this universe .,technology
in a sense we what what what if we say what do we what do we know about whats going on in the universe ?,technology
what we know is what our consciousness record about whats going on in the universe ?,technology
and consciousness is part of the fabric of the universe .,technology
yes we are in it .,technology
and maybe i should maybe i should start off by saying something about the consciousness story because thats some yes .,technology
maybe we should begin even before that at the very base layer of the wolfram physic project maybe you can give a broad overview once again quick about this hypergraph model .,technology
and also what is it a year and a half ago since youve brought this project to the world what is the status of date where what are all the beautiful idea you have come across ?,technology
what are the interesting thing you can mention ?,technology
i mentioned it is it is a it is a it is a freaking cambrian explosion .,technology
it is it is crazy .,technology
there are all these thing which ive wanted about for year .,technology
and suddenly there way to think about them .,technology
and i did not see the real strength of whats happened .,technology
i absolutely did not see coming .,technology
and the real strength of it is weve got this model for physic but it turn out it is a foundational model thats a different computation model that i am calling this multicomputational model .,technology
and that that model is applicable not only to physic but also to lot of other kind of thing .,technology
and one reason thats extremely powerful is because physic ha been very successful .,technology
we know a lot based on what we figured out in physic .,technology
and if we know that the same model governs physic and governs i do not know economics linguistics immunology whatever we know that the same model governs those thing .,technology
we can start using thing that weve successfully discovered in physic and applying those intuition in all these other area .,technology
and thats pretty exciting and very surprising to me .,technology
and in fact it is in the original story of you go and you explain why is there complexity in the natural world then you realize there all this complexity there all this computational irreducibility .,technology
there a lot we can not know about whats going to happen .,technology
it is very confusing thing for people who say science ha nailed everything down .,technology
we are going to based on science we can know everything .,technology
there this computational irreducibility thing in the middle of that thrown up by science to speak .,technology
and then the question is given computational irreducibility how can we figure out anything about what happens in the world ?,technology
why are not we why are we able to predict anything ?,technology
why are we able to operate in the world ?,technology
and the answer is that we live in these slice of computational reeutability that exist in this ocean of computational irreducibility .,technology
thats been an exciting thing but i would say that in general for our project it is been going spectacularly .,technology
it is very honestly it wasnt something i expected to happen in my lifetime .,technology
but i think that the thing that whats happened with the physic project it is a it can explain a little bit about how the model work but we can maybe ask you the following question .,technology
it is easy through word describe how cellular atomic work youve explained this and it is the fundamental mechanism by which you in your book and you science explore the idea of complexity and how to do science in this world of reducible island and irreducible generally irreducibility .,technology
how doe the model of hypographs differ from cellular atomic and how doe the idea of multicomputation differ ?,technology
maybe thats a way to describe it .,technology
and then all we know about these atom of space is how they relate to each other .,technology
wed say these three atom of space are associated with each other in some relation .,technology
you can think about that a what atom of space is friend with what other atom of space .,technology
you can build this essentially friend network of the atom of space .,technology
and the starting point about physic project is thats what our universe is .,technology
it is a giant friend network of the atom of space .,technology
and how can that possibly represent our universe ?,technology
it is in something water their molecule bouncing around but on a large scale that that produce fluid flow and we have fluid vortex and we have all of these phenomenon that are the emergent phenomenon from that underlying collection of molecule bouncing around .,technology
and by the way it is important that that collection of molecule bouncing around have this phenomenon of computational irreducibility .,technology
thats what lead to the second law of thermodynamics among other thing .,technology
and that lead to randomness of the underlying behavior which is what give you something which on a large scale seems it is a smooth continuous type of thing .,technology
and first thing is space is made of something it is made of all these atom of space connected together in this network .,technology
and then everything that we experience is feature of that structure of space .,technology
and it give you some odd enough the vortex look an atom itself a basic element .,technology
there the level of abstraction if you squint and blur thing out it look at every level of abstraction you can define what is a basic individual entity .,technology
yes but in this model there a bottom level .,technology
there an elementary link maybe it is a minus one hundred ten to the minus one hundred meter let say which is small proton is ten to the minus fifteen meter .,technology
the smallest weve ever been able to see with a particle accelerator a a random ten to the minus twenty one meter .,technology
if we do not know precisely what the correct scale is but it is perhaps over the order of ten to the minus one hundred meter .,technology
it is pretty small .,technology
and but thats thats the end thats thats what thing are made of .,technology
whats your intuition or where the ten to the minus one hundred come from ?,technology
whats your intuition about this scale ?,technology
there a calculation which i consider to be somewhat rickety which ha to do with comparing there are various fundamental constant .,technology
there a speed of light .,technology
the speed of light once the elementary time the speed of light is tell you the conversion from the elementary time to the elementary length .,technology
then there the question of how do you convert to the elementary energy and how do you convert to between other thing .,technology
and there a constant we know the speed of light we know the gravitational constant we know planck constant and quantum mechanic .,technology
those are the three important one .,technology
and we know some other thing we know thing the size of the universe the hubble constant thing that .,technology
turn out in our model there is an additional parameter which is essentially the number of simultaneous thread of execution of the universe which is essentially the number of independent quantum process that are going on .,technology
and that number let see if i remember that number that number is ten to the one hundred and seventy i think and it is a big number .,technology
but that number then connects modifies what you might think from all these planck unit to give you the thing we are giving .,technology
and there been a mystery and there more technical physic thing that the planck mass the planck energy planck energy is surprisingly big .,technology
the planck length is tiny ten to the minus thirty four meter that planck time ten to the minus forty three meter i think for second i think .,technology
but the planck energy is the energy of a lightning strike which is pretty weird .,technology
and our model the actual elementary energy is that divided by the number of simultaneous quantum thread and it end up being small too .,technology
and that explains that mystery thats been around for a while about how planck unit work .,technology
but whether that precise estimate is we do not know yet .,technology
thats one of the thing that been a thing weve been pretty interested in is how do through how do you make a gravitational microscope that can see through to the atom of space ?,technology
how do you get an influx flow for example if you go to hypersonic flow or something youve got a mark twenty space plane or something it matter that they are individual molecule hitting the space plane not a continuous food .,technology
the question is what is the analogous what is the analog of hypersonic flow for our first thing about the structure of space time ?,technology
and it look a rapidly rotating black hole at the critical rotation rate .,technology
it look a if thats a case where essentially the structure of space time is about to fall apart .,technology
we do not know that yet .,technology
you maybe elaborate a little bit deeper how a microscope they can see to tend to the minus one hundred how rotating black hole and presumably the detailed accurate detection of gravitational wave from such black hole can reveal the discrepaness of space .,technology
first thing is what is a black hole ?,technology
we need to go a little bit further in the story of whats based time is because i explained a little bit about what space is but it did not talk about what time is and thats important in understanding space time .,technology
it is been and your sense is both space and time in this story or discreet .,technology
absolutely but it is a complicated story .,technology
and needle to say .,technology
it is important at the bottom it is very simple at the bottom .,technology
it is very in the end it is simple but deeply abstract .,technology
and and something that is simple in conception but wrapping one head around whats going on is pretty hard .,technology
it is it is some and we are saying and thats the relation between atom of space are the hyper edge of the hypograph .,technology
and we got some big collection of these atom of space maybe ten to the four hundred or something in our in our universe .,technology
and thats the structure of space thats an every feature of what we experience in the world is a feature of that that hypograph thats spatial hypograph .,technology
then the question is how doe what doe that special hypograph do ?,technology
the idea is that there are rule that update thats spatial hypograph .,technology
and in a cellular automaton youve got this line of cell and you say it every step and every time step youve got fixed time step fixed array of cell at every step every cell get updated according to a certain rule .,technology
and thats the thats the way it work .,technology
now in this hypograph it is vaguely the same thing .,technology
we say every time a little piece of hypograph that look this update it to one that look this .,technology
it is keep rewriting this hypograph .,technology
every time something look that anywhere in the universe it get rewritten .,technology
now one thing thats tricky about that which will come to is this multicomputational idea which ha to do with you are not saying in some lockstep way do this one then this one then this one .,technology
it is whenever one you can do you can go ahead and do it .,technology
and that lead one not to have a single thread of time in the universe .,technology
because if you knew which one to do you would say do this one then we do this one then we do this one .,technology
but if you say do whichever one you feel you end up with these multiple thread of time .,technology
it is multiple history of the universe depending on which order you happen to do the thing you could do in .,technology
it is fundamentally a synchronous and parallel .,technology
yes which is very uncomfortable for the human brain that seek for thing to be sequential .,technology
and synchronous. . i think that this is part of the story of consciousness is i think the key aspect of consciousness that is important for parsing the universe is this point that we have a single thread of experience .,technology
we have a memory of what happened in the past .,technology
we can say something predict something about the future but there a single thread of experience .,technology
and it is not obvious it should work that way .,technology
weve got one hundred billion neuron in our brain and they are all firing in all kind of different way .,technology
but yet our experience is that there is the single thread of time that go along .,technology
and the fact to go on with the basic setup it is we got this spatial hypergraph it is got all these atom of space .,technology
they are getting they are getting these little clump of atom of space they are getting turned into other clump of atom of space .,technology
and thats happening everywhere in the universe all the time .,technology
and one thing it is a little bit weird it is there nothing permanent in the universe .,technology
the universe is getting rewritten everywhere all the time .,technology
and if it wasnt getting rewritten it would space wouldnt be knitted together .,technology
that is space would fall apart .,technology
there wouldnt be any way in which we could say this part of space is next to this part of space .,technology
one of the thing that i wa people were confused about back in antiquity ancient greek philosopher and on is how doe motion work ?,technology
how can it be the case that you can take a thing that we can walk around ?,technology
and it is still u when we walked a foot forward to speak .,technology
and in a sense with our model thats again a question because it is a different set of atom of space when we when i move my hand it is moving into a different set of atom of space .,technology
it is having to be recreated it is not the thing itself is not there it is being continuously recreated all the time .,technology
now it is a little bit wave in an ocean vortex and fluid which again the actual molecule that exist in those are not what define the identity of the thing .,technology
and but it is a little bit this idea that there can be pure motion that it is even possible for an object to move around in the universe and not change is it is not selfevident that such a thing should be possible .,technology
and that is part of our perception of the universe is that we we parse those aspect to the universe where thing pure motion are possible .,technology
now pure motion even in general it is a bit of a complicated thing .,technology
if you imagine your average teacup or something approaching a black hole it is deformed and distorted by the structure of space time .,technology
and to say is it pure motion ?,technology
is it that same teacup thats the same shape ?,technology
it is a bit of a complicated story .,technology
and this is a more extreme version of that .,technology
anyway the thing thats happening is weve got space weve got this notion of time .,technology
time is this this rewriting of the hypergraph .,technology
and one of the thing thats important about that time is this computational irreducible process .,technology
there something time is not something where it is the mathematical view of time tends to be time is to coordinate .,technology
we can slide a slider turn a knob and well change the time that weve got in this equation .,technology
but in this picture of time thats not how it work at all .,technology
time is this inexorable irreducible set of computation that go on that go from where we are now to the future .,technology
and space and time they are all these folk story you can tell about why space and time is the same thing .,technology
in this model they are fundamentally not the same thing .,technology
space is this connection between these atom of space time is this computational process .,technology
the thing that the first surprising thing is it turn out you get relativity anyway .,technology
and in the end the only thing you can tell is what are the causal relationship between event .,technology
an event in this an elementary event is a little piece of hypergraph got rewritten .,technology
and that mean a few hyper edge of the hypergraph were consumed by the event and you produce some other hyper edge .,technology
and thats an elementary event .,technology
and then the question is what we can tell is what the network of causal relationship between elementary event thats the ultimate thing with causal graph of the universe .,technology
and it turn out that there this property of causal invariance that is true of a bunch of these model .,technology
and i think is inevitably true for a variety of reason that make it be the case that it doesnt matter if you are saying ive got this hypergraph and i can rewrite this piece here and this piece here and i do the more and different order .,technology
when you construct the causal graph for each of those order that you choose to do thing in youll end up with the same causal graph .,technology
and thats essentially why thats in the end why rotivity work .,technology
it is why our perception of space and time is a a having this connection that rotivity say they should have .,technology
and thats thats how that work .,technology
i think i am missing a little piece .,technology
if you can go there again you said the fact that the observer is embedded in this hypergraph whats missing ?,technology
what is the observer not able to stay above this universe space ?,technology
the only thing they know is the set of causal relationship .,technology
let imagine that the universe is a touring machine .,technology
touring machine have this one update head which doe something and otherwise a term machine doe nothing .,technology
and the term machine work by having this head move around and do it is updating where the head happens to be .,technology
the question is could the universe be a touring machine ?,technology
could the universe have a single updating head thats zipping around all over the place ?,technology
you say thats crazy because i am talking to you you seem to be updating i am updating etc .,technology
but the thing is there no way to know that because if there wa this head moving around it is it update me but you are completely frozen at that point .,technology
until the head ha come over and updated you you have no idea what happened to me .,technology
and if you unravel that argument you realize the only thing we can tell is what the network of causal relationship between the thing that happened were .,technology
we do not get to know from some outside god eye view of the thing .,technology
we do not get to know what from the outside what happened .,technology
we only get to know what the set of relationship between the thing that happened we have .,technology
but if i somehow record a trace of this i guess we would be called multicomputation can not i then look back in the thought of the trace ?,technology
some you place throughout the universe throughout a log that record in my own pocket of in this hypergraph can not i realizing that i am getting an outdated picture ?,technology
see the problem is that this is where thing start getting very entangled in term of what one understands .,technology
the problem is that any such recording device is itself part of the universe .,technology
you do not get to say you never get to say let go outside the universe and go do this .,technology
and thats why lot of the feature of this model and the way thing work end up being a result of that .,technology
what i guess from an human level what is the cost you are paying ?,technology
what are you missing from not getting an updated picture all the time ?,technology
i understand what you said .,technology
but how doe consciousness emerge from that ?,technology
how what are the limitation of that observer ?,technology
i understand you are getting a deli thats thats there a bunch of limitation of the observer i think .,technology
maybe explain something about quantum mechanic because that maybe is an extreme version of some of these issue which help to motivate why one should think thing through a little bit more carefully .,technology
one feature of this in standard physic high school physic you learn they quagged the emotion for a ball and the it say you are through the ball the angle this velocity thing will move in this way and there a definite answer. ?,technology
the key story of quantum mechanic is there are not definite answer to where doe the ball go ?,technology
there this whole bundle of possible path and all we say we know from quantum mechanic is certain probability for where the ball will end up .,technology
thats the core idea of quantum mechanic .,technology
in our model quantum mechanic is not some plugin addon type thing .,technology
you absolutely can not get away from quantum mechanic because a you think about updating this hypergraph there is not one sequence of thing one definite sequence of thing that can happen .,technology
there are all these different possible update sequence that can occur .,technology
you could do this piece of the hypergraph now and then this one later etc etc etc .,technology
all those different part of history correspond to these quantum quantum part in quantum mechanic .,technology
these different possible quantum history .,technology
i wanted the thing thats surprising about it is they they branch there can be a certain state of the universe and it could do this or it could do that but they can also merge .,technology
they can be two state of the universe which they are next state .,technology
the next state they produce is the same for both of them .,technology
and that process of branching and merging is critical and the idea that they can be merging is critical and somewhat nontrivial for these hypergraphs because there a whole graph i see morphism story and there a whole very elaborate set of map where that is .,technology
thats where the causal invariance come in .,technology
yes thats but then what happens is that what what one seeing weve got this thing it is branching it is merging etc etc etc .,technology
now the question is how do we perceive that ?,technology
how do we why do not we notice that the universe is branching and merging ?,technology
why why is it the case that we think a definite set of thing happen ?,technology
the answer is we are embedded in that universe and our brain are branching and merging too .,technology
and what quantum mechanic becomes a story of is how doe a branching brain perceive a branching universe ?,technology
and the key thing is a soon a you say i think definite thing happen in the universe .,technology
that mean you are essentially conflating lot of different part of history .,technology
you are saying a far a i am concerned because i am convinced that definite thing happen in the universe all these part of history must be equivalent .,technology
now it is not obvious that that would be a consistent thing to do .,technology
it might be you say all these part of history equivalent but by golly moment later that would be a completely inconsistent point of view .,technology
everything would have gone to hell in different way .,technology
the fact that that doesnt happen is thats a consequence of this causal invariance thing but thats and the fact that that doe happen a little bit is what cause little quantum effect .,technology
and if that did not happen at all there wouldnt be anything that is quantum mechanic .,technology
it would be quantum mechanic is in this in this this bundle of path it is a little bit what happens in statistical mechanic and fluid mechanic whatever that most of the time you see this continuous fluid .,technology
you see the world progressing in this way thats this continuous fluid .,technology
but every often if you look at the exact itspirament you can start seeing it is made of these molecule where they might go that way or they might go this way and thats quantum effect .,technology
and thats this idea of where we are embedded in the universe this branching brain is perceiving this branching universe and that end up being a story of quantum mechanic .,technology
thats part of the whole picture of whats going on .,technology
but i think to come back to where this consciousness what is the story of consciousness ?,technology
in the universe weve got whatever it is ten to the four hundred atom of space they are all doing these complicated thing .,technology
it is all a big complicated irreducible computation .,technology
the question is what do we perceive from all of that ?,technology
and the answer is that we are parsing the universe in a particular way .,technology
let me again go back to the gas molecule analogy .,technology
in the gas in this room there are molecule bouncing around all kind of complicated pattern .,technology
but we do not care .,technology
all we notice is there the gas law are satisfied .,technology
maybe there some fluid dynamic these are feature of that assembly molecule that we notice .,technology
and then lot of detail we do not notice .,technology
when you say we do mean the tool of physic it do mean are the human brain and it perception system .,technology
the human brain is where it start but we built a bunch of instrument to do a bit better than the human brain .,technology
but they still have many of the same kind of idea their camera and their pressure sensor and their these kind of thing .,technology
they are not at this point we do not know how to make fundamentally qualitatively different sensory devices. . and it is always an extension of the conscious experience of the sensory experience .,technology
what are sensory experience ?,technology
and sensory experience that somehow intricately tied to consciousness. . one question is when we are looking at all these molecule in the gas and they might be ten to twenty it molecule and some little box or something it is what do we notice about those molecule ?,technology
one thing that we can say is we do not notice that much .,technology
we are we are computationally bounded observer .,technology
we can not go in and say i am the ten of the twenty molecule and i know that i can decrypt emotion and i can figure out this and that .,technology
it is i am going to say whats the average density molecule .,technology
and one key feature of u is that we are computationally bounded .,technology
and that when you are looking at a universe which is full of computation and doing huge amount of computation but we are computationally bounded there only certain thing about that universe that we are going to be sensitive to .,technology
we are not going to be figuring out what all the atom are space are doing because we are computationally bounded observer and we are only sampling these small set of feature .,technology
i think the two defining feature of consciousness that and i would say that the preamble to this is for year because ive talked about computation and fundamental feature of physic and science people ask me what about consciousness ?,technology
and i for year ive said i have nothing to say about consciousness .,technology
and ive told the story you talk about intelligence you talk about life .,technology
these are both feature where you say whats the abstract definition of life ?,technology
we do not know the abstract definition .,technology
we know the one for life on earth .,technology
it is got rna it is got cell membrane it is got all this stuff .,technology
similarly for intelligence we know the human definition of intelligence but what is intelligence abstract ?,technology
and what ive long believed is that the abstract definition of intelligence is computational sophistication .,technology
that is that a soon a you can be computational it is sophisticated thats the abstract version that generalized version of intelligence .,technology
then the question is what about consciousness ?,technology
and what i realized is that consciousness is a step down from intelligence .,technology
that is that you might think consciousness is the top of the pile but i do not think it is .,technology
i think that there this notion of computational sophistication which is the generalized intelligence but consciousness ha two limitation i think .,technology
one of them is computational boundedness .,technology
that is that we are only perceiving a computationally bounded view of the universe .,technology
and the other is this idea of a single thread of time .,technology
that is that we and in fact we know neurophysiologically our brain go to some trouble to give u this one thread of attention to speak .,technology
and it is not the case that in all the neuron and our brain that that at least in our conscious note the the corresponds to language and our conscious experience we have the single thread of attention single thread of perception .,technology
and maybe there something unconscious thats bubbling around thats the almost the quantum version of whats happening in our brain .,technology
to speak weve got the the classical flow of what we are mostly thinking about to speak but there this bubbling around of other pod that is all those other neuron that did not make it to be part of our conscious stream of experience .,technology
in that sense intelligence a computational sophistication is much broader than the the computational constraint which conscious and separate under and also the sequential thing .,technology
the notion of time thats thats interesting but then the the the follow of question is starting to get a sense of what is intelligence .,technology
now how doe that connect our human brick ?,technology
is you are saying intelligence is almost a fabric what we plug into it or something yeah i think people consciousness plug into it .,technology
yeah the intelligence i think the core intelligence some level a word but we are asking what is the the notion of intelligence a we generalize it beyond the bound of human beyond the bound of even the ai that we human have built and on .,technology
what what is intelligence is the weather people say the weather ha a mind of it own .,technology
what doe that mean ?,technology
can the weather be intelligent ?,technology
what doe agency have to do with intelligence here ?,technology
is intelligence your conception of computation ?,technology
intelligence is the is the capacity to perform computation and see i think .,technology
i think thats and i think that this question of of is it for a purpose that quickly degenerate into a horrible philosophical mess because whenever you say did the weather do that for a purpose ?,technology
it wa trying to move a bunch of hot air from the quater to the pole or something .,technology
thats it purpose .,technology
but why because it seemed to be equally a dumb today a i wa yesterday .,technology
there some persistence or a consistency over time that the intelligence i plugged into .,technology
whats it seems there a hard constraint but the team amount of computation i can perform in my consciousness .,technology
they seem to you close to connected somehow .,technology
i think the point is that the thing that give you the ability to have conscious intelligence you can have this .,technology
one thing is we do not know intelligence is other than the one that are very much u . yes. . and one that are very much u i think have this feature of single threat of time bounded computationally bounded .,technology
now that but you also need computational sophistication having a single threat of time and being computational bounded you could be a clock going ticktock that would satisfy those condition .,technology
but the fact that we have this irreducible computational ability thats thats an important feature .,technology
thats thats the the the the bedrock on which we can construct the thing we construct .,technology
in other word if we say why do we believe that there is a continuous space let say why do we believe that gravity work the way it doe ?,technology
in principle we could be parsing detail of the universe that were that involve the analogy is again with statistical mechanic and molecule and a box .,technology
we could be sensitive to every detail of the swirling around with these molecule and we could say what matter is the the wiggle effect .,technology
that is there something that we human never notice because in some weird thing that happens when there are fifteen collision of air molecule and this happens and that happens .,technology
we see the pure motion of a ball .,technology
i am moving about. . and why do we see that ? .,technology
what seems to be the case is that a soon a we assume computational boundedness single thread of time that lead u to general to it .,technology
in other word we can not avoid that .,technology
thats the way that we we will parse the universe given those constraint .,technology
we parse the universe according to those particular in such a way that we say the aggregate reducible pocket of computational reducible let say that we slice out of this whole computational reducible ocean of behavior is this one that corresponds to general activity .,technology
but we do not perceive general relativity .,technology
we do if we do fancy experiment .,technology
you are saying perceived doe mean the full of something .,technology
thats a great example of general activity in action .,technology
thats not what the difference is in that in newtonian mechanic .,technology
this is when i say general relativity thats gravity .,technology
the uber theory to speak .,technology
newtonian gravity is the approximation that we can make on the earth and thing that .,technology
this is the phenomenon of gravity is one that is a consequence of we would perceive something very different from gravity .,technology
the way to understand that is when we think about we make up reference frame with which we parse whats happening in space and time .,technology
in other word one of the one of the thing that we do is we say a time progress everywhere in space is something happens at a particular time and then we go to the next time .,technology
and we say this is what space at the next time this is what space at the next time .,technology
thats it is the reason we are used to doing that is because when we look around we might see ten hundred meter away .,technology
the time it take light to travel that distance is short compared to the time it take our brain to know what happened .,technology
a far a our brain are concerned we are parsing the universe in this there is a moment in time it is all of space there a moment in time it is all of space .,technology
if we were the size of planet something we would have a different perception because the speed of light would be much more important to u . we wouldnt have this perception that thing happen progressively in time everywhere in space .,technology
and thats an important constraint .,technology
and the reason that we parse the universe in the way that cause u to say gravity work the way it doe is because we are doing thing deciding that we can say the universe exists space ha a definite structure .,technology
there is a moment in time space ha this definite structure .,technology
we moved to the next moment in time space .,technology
another structure that set up is what let u deduce what past the universe in such a way that we say gravity work the way it doe .,technology
that reference frame that the illusion of that is that you are saying that somehow useful for consciousness .,technology
thats what consciousness doe because in a sense what consciousness is doing is there are it is insisting that the universe is sequentialized .,technology
that is and it is not allowing the possibility that there are these multiple thread of time and they are all flowing differently .,technology
it is saying no everything is happening in this one thread of experience that we have .,technology
and that illusion of that one thread of experience can not happen at the planetary scale .,technology
here are you saying typical human ?,technology
are you saying we are at a human level a special here for consciousness ?,technology
for our consciousness it is if we existed at a scale close to the elementary length for example then our perception of the universe will be absurdly different .,technology
but this make it consciousness seem a weird side effect of this particular scale .,technology
and who care ?,technology
the consciousness is not that special .,technology
i think look i think that a very interesting question is which ive said in a little bit about is what can you imagine ?,technology
what is a factoring of something what are some other possible way you could exist to speak and if you were a photon if you were some thing that wa some intelligence represented in term of photon .,technology
for example the photon we receive in the cosmic microwave background those photon a far a they are concerned the universe started .,technology
they were emitted one hundredzero year off of the beginning of the universe theyve been traveling at the speed of light time stayed still for them and then they arrived and we detected them .,technology
for them the universe started and thats a different perception of that ha implication for a very different perception of time .,technology
they do not have their single thread it seems to be important for being able to tell a heck of a good story .,technology
we human tell story .,technology
we can tell u story .,technology
we can tell u story .,technology
we can tell u story .,technology
what other kind of story can you tell ?,technology
photon are boring story .,technology
yeah thats it .,technology
can you can you maybe elaborate how the principle of computational equivalence can save a planet ?,technology
that would that would be a a terrible spoiler for me .,technology
there would be a spoiler yeah but but no but i let me say what the principle of computational equivalence is .,technology
the question is you are you have a system you have some rule you can think of it behavior a corresponding to a computation .,technology
the question is how sophisticated is that computation ?,technology
we are both running computation that are the same law the same level of computation to speak .,technology
you can you can use natural computation to compute thing to speak .,technology
you can use nature to compute you do not need to have done all that engineering and it is the it is it is feel a little disappointing that you say we are going to build all these server .,technology
we are going to do all these thing .,technology
we are going to make maybe we are going to have human consciousness uploaded into some elaborate digital environment and then you look at that thing and you say it is got electron moving around in a rock and then you say whats the difference ?,technology
and the principle of computational equivalence say there is not at some level a fundamental you can not say mathematically there a fundamental difference between the rock that is the future of human consciousness and the rock thats a rock .,technology
if only we could parse the universe in the way immediately this amazing thing thats going on in this huge culture thats developed and all that thing would be obvious to u but it is not because we have a particular way of parsing the universe .,technology
would that thing also have a agency i do not know the word to use but something consciousness but a different consciousness ?,technology
i suspect that any of these thing would also have an intrinsic feeling about themselves .,technology
ive been trying to think recently about constructing an experiment about what if you would a piece of a cellular automaton thats what would you are feeling about your self be ?,technology
and can we put ourselves in the shoe and the cell of the cellular automaton to speak ?,technology
can we can we get ourselves close enough to that that we could have a sense of what the world would be if you were operating in that way ?,technology
see the main issue is this .,technology
where it is a philosophical difficult thing because it is we do what we do .,technology
we understand ourselves at least to some extent .,technology
thats correct .,technology
and but yet what are we trying to do for example when we are trying to make a model of physic ?,technology
what are we trying to do ?,technology
because you say can we work out what the universe doe ?,technology
of course we can we watch the universe the universe doe what it doe .,technology
but what we are trying to do when we make a model of physic is we are trying to get to the point where we can tell a story to ourselves that we understand that is also a representation of what the universe doe .,technology
it is this can we make a bridge between what we human can understand in our mind and what the universe doe .,technology
and in a sense a large part of my life effort have been devoted to making computational language which is a bridge between what is possible in the computational universe and what we human can conceptualize and think about .,technology
and in a sense when you add physic you are adding this other piece where we can mediated by computer can we get physic to the point where we human can understand something about whats happening in it .,technology
and when we talk about an alien intelligence it is the same story .,technology
it is is there a way of mapping whats happening there onto something that we human can understand ?,technology
and physic in some sense is our exhibit one of the story of alien intelligence .,technology
and what we are doing in making a model of physic is mapping that onto something that we understand .,technology
when you are talking about to backtrack a little bit about cellular atomic being able to whats it to be a cellular atomic in the way thats equivalent to what it is to be a conscious human being ?,technology
how do you approach that ?,technology
and the question is how do you get inside it ?,technology
it is when we with human ?,technology
it is we can not get inside each others consciousness .,technology
it is there is an experience that somebody is having but you can perceive thing from the outside but getting inside it .,technology
and i for me these thought ill go to susan this one i have not untangled .,technology
yeah but there may be a way to map the program to your conscious experience .,technology
for example when you play a video game you do a first person shooter .,technology
you walk around inside this entity .,technology
it is very different thing that i am watching in this entity .,technology
if you can somehow connect more and more connect this this full conscious experience to this subset of the cellular automaton .,technology
yeah it is something that .,technology
but the difference in the first person shooter thing is they are still your brain and your memory is still remembering you you still have it is it is hard to again what one going to get ?,technology
one is not going to be able to be the cellular automaton .,technology
one going to be able to watch what the cellular automaton doe .,technology
but this is the frustrating thing that i am trying to understand how to how to think about being it to speak. . in virtual reality there a concept of immersion what anything with video game with book there a concept of immersion .,technology
it feel over time if the virtual reality experience is a done and maybe in the future will be extremely done the immersion lead you to feel you mentioned memory you forget that you even ever existed outside that experience .,technology
you could argue mathematically that you can never truly become a mar book .,technology
yeah why can not you merge with the cellular automaton ?,technology
yeah but you are you are you are you are yeah you are part of the same fabric .,technology
why can not you thats a good question .,technology
let imagine the following scenario .,technology
whats thats but then can you return back ?,technology
it is let imagine youve uploaded your brain is scanned .,technology
youve got every synapse mapped out .,technology
you upload everything about you the brain simulator .,technology
you upload the brain simulator and the brain simulator is some glorified cellular automaton .,technology
and then you say now weve got an answer to what doe it feel to be a cellular automaton ?,technology
it feel it felt to be ordinary you because they are both computational system and they are both operating in the same way .,technology
in a sense but i think there there somehow more to it because in in that sense when you are making a brain simulator it is we are saying there another version of our consciousness .,technology
the question that we are asking is if we tease away from our consciousness and get to something that is different how do we make a bridge to understanding whats going on there ?,technology
and there a way of thinking about this this is coming on to question about the existence of the universe and on .,technology
but one of the thing is there this notion that we have of rural space .,technology
we have this idea of this physical space which is something you can move around in thats associated with that show the extent of the spatial hypergraph then there what we call branchial space the space of quantum branch .,technology
in this in this thing we call the multiway graph of all of this branching history there this idea of a space where instead of moving around in physical space you are moving from history to history to speak from one possible history to another possible history .,technology
and thats a different space that is the space in which quantum mechanic play out .,technology
quantum mechanic for example something i think we are slowly understanding thing destructive interference in quantum mechanic .,technology
the whats happening is branchial space is associated with phase in quantum mechanic .,technology
and whats happening is the two photon that are supposed to be interfering and destructively interfering a winding up at different end of branchial space .,technology
and u a these poor observer that are trying to that have branching brain that are trying to conflate together these different thread of history and say weve got a consistent story that we are telling here .,technology
we are knitting together these thread of history .,technology
by the time the two photon wound up at opposite end of branchial space we can not knit them together to tell a consistent story .,technology
for u thats the analog of destructive interference .,technology
and then there a space too which is the space of rule .,technology
thats another level up .,technology
there the question i do want to mention one thing because it is something ive realized in recent time and it is i think it is cool which is about time dilation and relativity .,technology
and it help to understand something that help in understanding whats going on .,technology
and in other word it is the twin who go off to alpha centauri and go very fast will age much le than the twin who on earth that is hanging out where they are hanging out .,technology
why doe that happen ?,technology
it ha to do with what motion is .,technology
in in our model of physic what is motion ?,technology
when you move from somewhere to somewhere it is you are having to recreate yourself at a different place in space .,technology
when you exist at a particular place and you are evolve with time you are again you are updating yourself you are you are following these rule to update what happens .,technology
and you do not have a much computation left over to work out what happens progressively with time .,technology
and thats thats why time dilation happens .,technology
and you can you can start it is interesting that one can get an intuition about something that because it ha seemed a mathematical fact about the mathematics of special relativity and on .,technology
for me it is a little bit confusing what the you in that picture is because you are using up computation .,technology
with simply saying the entity is updating itself according to the way that the universe update itself .,technology
and the question is your those update thats imagine the you a a clock ?,technology
but but then the alternative is that situation one where the thing is at rest situation two where it is moving the whats happening is it is having to recreate itself at every at every moment .,technology
the thing is going to have to do the computation to be able to recreate itself at a different position in space .,technology
and thats the intuition behind .,technology
it is either going to spend it computation recreating itself at a different position in space or it is going to spend it computation doing the doing the updating of the of the ticking of the clock to speak .,technology
the more updating is doing the le the ticking of the clock update is doing .,technology
the more it hasnt to update because of motion yeah the le it can update the clock .,technology
but the the thing about this physical space and physical space the main big theory is general relativity the theory of gravity and that tell you how thing move in physical space .,technology
in branching space the big theory is the feynman path and the girl which it turn out tell you essentially how thing move in quantum in the space of quantum phase .,technology
it is motion and branching space .,technology
and it is a fun thing to start thinking about what all these thing that we know in physical space eventorizing and black hole and on .,technology
what are the analogous thing in branching space ?,technology
for example the speed of light whats the analog of the speed of light in branching space ?,technology
it is the maximum speed of quantum entanglement .,technology
the speed of light is a flash bulb go off here .,technology
whats the maximum rate at which the effect of that flash bulb is detectable moving away in space ?,technology
similarly in branching space something happens and the question is how far in this branching space in the space of quantum state how far away can that get within a certain period of time ?,technology
and there this notion of a maximum entanglement speed and that might be observable .,technology
thats the thing weve been poking at is might there be a way to observe it even in some atomic physic situation .,technology
because one of the thing thats weird in quantum mechanic is when we study quantum mechanic we mostly study it in term of small number of particle .,technology
this electron doe this this thing on an ion trap doe that and on .,technology
but what we do with large number of particle all bet are off .,technology
it is too complicated deal with quantum mechanic .,technology
it is there two carbon atom there this molecule and we do a reaction and we draw a diagram and we say this carbon atom end up in this place and it is but wait a minute in quantum mechanic nothing end up in a definite place .,technology
there always some wave function for this to happen .,technology
how can it be the case that we can draw these reasonable it ended up in this place ?,technology
and you have to say the environment of the molecule effectively made a bunch of measurement on the molecule to keep it classical .,technology
and thats a story that ha to do with this whole thing about about measurement have to do with this idea of can we conclude that something definite happened ?,technology
because in quantum mechanic the intrinsic quantum mechanic the mathematics of quantum mechanic is all about they are these amplitude for different thing to happen .,technology
then there this thing of and then we make a measurement and we conclude that something definite happened .,technology
and that ha to do with this thing i think about moving about knitting together these different thread of history and saying this is now something where we can definitively say something definite happened .,technology
in the traditional theory of quantum mechanic it is after youve done all the sample sheet computation then this big hammer come down and you do a measurement and it is all over .,technology
and it look you can do a lot because youve got all these different thread going on .,technology
having this branchial space and this hypergraph model of physic do you think it is possible to then make prediction that are definite about a many body quantum mechanical system ?,technology
i think it is likely yes .,technology
yeah it get complicated .,technology
and this thing about getting it to a definite a definite prediction about definite thing you can say about chemistry or something this thats a lot of work .,technology
there a thing called the quantum xenoe effect .,technology
the idea is quantum stuff happens but then if you make a measurement you are freezing time in quantum mechanic .,technology
and it look there a possibility that with the relationship between the quantum xenoe effect and the way that many body quantum mechanic work and on maybe conceivably it may be possible to figure out a way to measure the maximum entanglement speed .,technology
and the reason we can potentially do that is because the system we deal with in term of atom and thing they are pretty big a mole of atom is it is a lot of atom .,technology
and but it is not a very it is something where to get when we are dealing with how can ten to the minus one hundred to speak ?,technology
by the time youve got ten to the thirty of atom you are not you are within a little bit closer striking distance of that .,technology
it is not weve got two atom and we are trying to see down to ten to the minus one hundred meter or whatever .,technology
i do not know how it will work but this is a this is a potential direction .,technology
and if you can tell by the way if we could measure the maximum entanglement speed we would know the elementary length .,technology
these are all related .,technology
if we get that one number we need one number .,technology
if we can get that one number we can the theory ha no parameter anymore .,technology
and there are other place there another another hope for doing that is in cosmology .,technology
in this model one of the feature is the universe is not fixed to mention .,technology
we think we love and three dimensional space but this hypergraph doesnt have any particular dimension .,technology
it can emerge a something which i am an approximation .,technology
it is a if you say whats the volume of a sphere in the hypergraph where a sphere is defined a how many node do you get to when you go a distance r away from a given point ?,technology
and one of the thing we suspect is that the very early universe wa essentially infinite dimensional and that a the universe expanded it became lower dimensional .,technology
and one of the thing that is another little point where we think there might be a way to measure some thing a dimension fluctuation in the early universe .,technology
that is is there a is there leftover dimension fluctuation of at the time of the cosmic micro background one hundredzero year or something after the beginning of the universe ?,technology
is it still the case that there were piece of the universe that did not have dimension three that had dimension three.one or something ?,technology
and can we tell that ?,technology
is that pathology observed fluctuation in dimension ?,technology
i do not even know what that entail .,technology
the question which should be an elementary exercise in lecture dynamic except it is not is understanding what happens to a photon when it propagates through three.one dimensional space ?,technology
for example the inverse square law is a consequence of the the the surface area of a sphere is proportional to r squared .,technology
but if you are not in three dimensional space the surface area of sphere is not proportional to r squared it is r to the whatever at two.one or something .,technology
and that mean that i think when you dry and do optic a common principle in optic is hygons principle which say that every piece of a wave front of a of a of light is a source of new spherical wave .,technology
and those spherical wave if they are different dimensional spherical wave will have other characteristic .,technology
and there will be bizarre optical phenomenon which we havent figured out yet .,technology
you are you are what looking for some weird photon trajectory that designate that it is three.one dimensional space ?,technology
yeah yeah that would be an example of there are only a certain number of thing we can measure about photon .,technology
we can measure the polarization we can measure the frequency we can measure the direction those kind of thing .,technology
and how that all work out .,technology
and in the current model of physic it is been hard to explain how the universe manages to be a uniform a it is .,technology
in our model this turn out to be much more natural because the universe start very connected .,technology
the hypergraph is not such that the ball that you grow starting from a single point ha volume are cubed .,technology
it might have volume out of the five hundred or out of the infinity .,technology
and that mean that you naturally get this much higher degree of connectivity and uniformity in the universe .,technology
we would to do the same thing including dimension change .,technology
this is difficult mathematical physic .,technology
the reason it is difficult is the fundamental reason it is difficult .,technology
when people invented calculus three hundred year ago calculus wa a story of understanding change and change a a function of a variable .,technology
you can not apply the tool of calculus and naturally and easily to fractional dimension .,technology
no and somebody ha to figure out how to do that .,technology
we are trying to figure this out .,technology
it is very interesting .,technology
it is very connected to very frontier astute mathematics .,technology
it is very beautiful .,technology
but is it possible is it possible we are dealing with scale thats much smaller than our human scale is it possible to make prediction versus explanation ?,technology
do you have a hope that this hypergraph model youll be able to make prediction ?,technology
that then could be validated with a physic experiment prediction that could have been done or werent done otherwise .,technology
yeah i think which in which domain do you think ?,technology
they are going to be cosmology one to do with dimension fluctuation and thats a very bizarre effect .,technology
nobody dimension fluctuation is something nobody ever looked for that .,technology
if anybody see dimension fluctuation thats a huge flag that thats something our model is going on .,technology
and how one detects that thats a problem of thats a problem of traditional physic in a sense of whats the best way to figure that out ?,technology
and for example thats one there are all kind of thing one could imagine .,technology
there are thing that in black hole merger it is possible that there will be effect of maximum entanglement speed in large black hole merger .,technology
thats another possible thing .,technology
and all of that is detected through what do you have a hope for ligo type of situation thats gravitational wave ?,technology
yeah or alternatively i think it is look figuring out experiment is figuring out technology inventions. . that is youve got to set a raw material youve got an underlying model .,technology
and now youve got to be very clever to figure out what is that thing i can measure that somehow leverage into the place .,technology
and weve spent le effort on that than i would have liked because one of the one of the reason is that that i think that the the physicist whove been working on our model and weve now lot of physicist it is very very nice .,technology
it is one of these case where i am almost i am pleasantly surprised that the absorption of the thing weve done ha been quite rapid and quite very positive .,technology
it is a campground explosion of physicist too and i they do .,technology
yes a lot of whats happened thats interesting and again not what i expected is .,technology
they are mathematical structure .,technology
and i think whats happened is our model provide a machine code that life underneath those model .,technology
a typical example this is a due to jonathan gorard who one of the key people who been working on our project .,technology
this is ill give you an example to give a sense of how these thing connect .,technology
there in causal set theory .,technology
the idea of causal set theory is there are in space time .,technology
we imagine that there space and time .,technology
it is the three plus one dimensional set up .,technology
we imagine that there are event that happen at different time and place in space and time .,technology
and the idea of causal set theory is the only thing you say about the universe is there are a bunch of event that happen randomly at different place in space and time .,technology
and then the whole theory of physic ha to be to do with this graph of causal relationship between these randomly thrown down event .,technology
theyve always been confused by the fact that to get even the rensen variant even relativeistic invariant you need a very special way to throw down those event .,technology
and theyve had no natural way to understand how that would happen .,technology
what jonathan figured out is that in fact from our model they instead of generating event at random our model necessarily generate event in some pattern in space time effectively that then lead to rensen variant and relativeistic invariant and all those kind of thing .,technology
it is a place where all the mathematics thats been done on we have a random collection of event .,technology
now what consequence doe that have in term of causal set theory and on that can all be wheeled in now that we have some different underlying foundational idea for what the particular distribution of event is a opposed to what we throw down random event .,technology
and thats a typical example of what we are seeing in all these different area of how you can take interesting thing that have been done in mathematical physic and connect them .,technology
and it is beautiful because the abstract model we have seem to plug into all these different very interesting very elegant abstract idea .,technology
but we are now giving a reason for that to be the way for a reason for one to care .,technology
it is saying you can think about computation abstractly .,technology
you can think about i do not know combinators or something a abstract computational thing .,technology
and you can do all kind of study of them but it is why do we care ?,technology
turn machine are a good start because you can see their mechanically doing thing .,technology
but when we start thinking about computer computing thing we have a good reason to care .,technology
and this is what we are what we are providing i think is a reason to care about a lot of these area of mathematical physic .,technology
thats been thats been very nice .,technology
i am not sure weve ever got to the the question of why doe the universe let talk about that .,technology
we are it is not the simplest question in the world .,technology
it take a few step to get to it .,technology
and it is nevertheless even surprising that you can even begin to answer this question .,technology
the next thing to perhaps understand is this idea of real space .,technology
weve got physical space weve got branchial space the space of possible quantum history .,technology
and now weve got another level of abstraction which is a space .,technology
and here where that come from .,technology
you say you say weve got this model for the universe weve got a particular rule .,technology
and we run this rule and we get the universe. . thats thats interesting .,technology
why that rule ?,technology
why not another rule ?,technology
and that confused me for a long time .,technology
then i realized what if the thing could be using all possible rule ?,technology
the next thing youd say is how can you get anything reasonable out ?,technology
how can anything real come out of the set of all possible rule applied in all possible way ?,technology
this is a subtle thing .,technology
which i havent fully untangled .,technology
the there is this object which is the result of running all possible rule in all possible way .,technology
and you might say if you are running all possible rule why can not everything possible happen ?,technology
the answer is because when you there this entanglement that occurs .,technology
let say that you have a lot of different possible initial condition a lot of different possible state .,technology
then you are applying these different rule .,technology
some of those rule can end up with the same state .,technology
it is not the case that you can get from anywhere to anywhere .,technology
there this whole entangled structure of what can lead to what and there a definite structure thats produced .,technology
i think i am going to call that definite structure of the ruley had the limit of the limit of all possible rule being applied in all possible way .,technology
and you are saying that structure is finite that somehow connects to maybe similar thing is causal invariance .,technology
there a rule .,technology
necessarily ha go on variance .,technology
thats a feature of thats a mathematical consequence of essentially using all possible rule plus universal computation give you the fact that for many diverging path you can always the path will always convert .,technology
doe that say that the rule doe that in this facility in further that the ruley had is a finite ?,technology
in the end it is not necessarily finite .,technology
it is it is a it is a it is a it is the history of the universe may not be finite .,technology
the history of the universe time may keep going forever .,technology
you can keep running the computation of the ruley had and youll keep spewing out more and more and more structure .,technology
it is time doesnt have to end .,technology
it is it is some that that but the the issue is there are there are three limit that happen and this ruley had object .,technology
one is how long you run the computation for .,technology
another is how many different rule you are applying and another is how many different state you start from .,technology
and the mixture of those three limit this is mathematically a horrendous object. ?,technology
and whats whats interesting about this object is the one thing that doe seem to be the case about this object is it connects with idea in higher category theory .,technology
and in particular it connects to some of the 20th century most abstract mathematics done by this chap growth and dec. groth and dec had a thing called the infinity groupoid which is closely related to this ruley had object .,technology
although the detail the relationship i do not fully understand yet .,technology
but i think that the whats whats interesting is this thing that is this very limiting object .,technology
a way to think about this that again well well take u into another direction which is the equivalence between physic and mathematics .,technology
the way that let see maybe this is to give a sense of this groupoid and thing that .,technology
you can think about in mathematics you can think you have certain axiom they are atom and you let say let talk about mathematics for a second .,technology
what is mathematics ?,technology
what is what is it made of to speak ?,technology
mathematics there a bunch of statement for addition x plus y is equal to y plus x. thats a statement in mathematics .,technology
another statement would be x squared minus y is equal to x plus y minus y. there are infinite number of these possible statement of mathematics .,technology
that mean that it give a statement but with x plus y it is a rule .,technology
you can it is a rule .,technology
it is a rule .,technology
it is a rule .,technology
it is also a thing that is true in mathematics. . the statement is true . . and what you can imagine is you you imagine laying out this giant ocean of all statement .,technology
you first thought this is where this wa segueing into a different thing .,technology
let me let me not go in this direction for a second .,technology
thats not going to methamathematics yet .,technology
yeah well maybe get to methamathematics but it is some let me explain the groupoid and thing later .,technology
but let come back to the universe always a good place to be in .,technology
what is the universe ha to do with the add the all space and how thats possible reconnected to why the thing exists at all and why there one of them .,technology
here the point .,technology
the thing that had confused me for a long time wa let say we get the rule for the universe .,technology
we hold it in our hand .,technology
we say this is our universe .,technology
then the immediate question is why is not it another one ?,technology
and thats the the the the lesson of coppana because it is we are not very special .,technology
how come we got universe number three hundred and twelve and not universe quadrupling quadrupling quadrupling .,technology
and i think the resolution of that is the realization that there that the universe is running all possible rule .,technology
then you say how an earth do we perceive the universe to be running according to a particular rule ?,technology
how do we perceive definite thing happening in the universe ?,technology
it is the same story .,technology
it is the observer .,technology
there is a reference frame that we are picking in this royal space .,technology
and that that is what determines our perception of the universe with our particular sensory information and on .,technology
we are parsing the universe in this particular way .,technology
here the way to think about it .,technology
in in in physical space we live in a particular place in the universe .,technology
and we could live in our first santorra but we do not we live here .,technology
and similarly in royal space we could live in many different place in royal space .,technology
but we happen to live here .,technology
and what is it mean to live here ?,technology
it mean we have certain sensory input .,technology
we have certain way to parse the universe .,technology
those are our interpretation of the universe .,technology
what would it mean to travel in royal space ?,technology
what it mean is that we are successfully interpreting the universe in different way .,technology
in other word to be at a different point in royal space is to have a different in a sense a different interpretation of whats going on in the universe .,technology
and we can imagine even thing an analog of the speed of light a the maximum speed of translation in royal space and on .,technology
wait whats the interpretation ?,technology
royal space and we a i am confused by the we in the interpretation and the universe i thought moving about in royal space change the way the universe is the way we would perceive it .,technology
the way that thats the way that it is ultimately ha to do with the perception .,technology
it doesnt royal royal space is not somehow changing branching into another universe something that .,technology
no the point is that the whole point of this is the ruley ad is the encapsulated version of everything that is the universe running according to all possible .,technology
yeah we think of our universe the observable universe a it is thing .,technology
we are a little bit loose with the word universe then because wooden the had a potentially encapsulate a very large number commonatory large maybe infinite set of what we human physicist think of a universe .,technology
thats an interesting interesting parsing of the word universe ?,technology
because what we are saying is a were at a particular place in physical space we are at a particular place in royal space at that particular place in royal space our experience of the universe is this .,technology
a if we live at the center of the galaxy our universe our experience of the universe will be different from the one it is given where we live .,technology
and in u what we are saying is our when you might say in a sense this had a a super universe it is big .,technology
but it is all entangled together .,technology
it is not you can separate out .,technology
you can say let me it is when we take a reference it is our experience of the universe is based on where we are in the universe .,technology
we could imagine moving to somewhere else in the universe but it is still the same universe .,technology
there not universe existing in parallel .,technology
no because because and the whole point is that if we were able to change our interpretation of whats going on we could perceive a different reference frame in this ad .,technology
yeah but thats not thats not thats yeah thats the same ad thats the same universe .,technology
you are moving about these are coordinate in there. . the way thats the reason thats interesting is imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence .,technology
the alien intelligence we should say the alien intelligence might live on alpha centauri but it might also live at a different place in real space .,technology
yeah it can live here on earth .,technology
it ha a different reference frame that includes a very different perception of universe. . and then because that real space is very large .,technology
do we guy have communicate with them ? .,technology
thats yeah but it is also one thing is how different the perception of the universe could be .,technology
i think it could be bizarrely unimaginably completely different .,technology
and one thing to realize is even in thing i do not understand i know about the western tradition of understanding science and all that thing .,technology
and you talk to people who say i i am into some eastern tradition of this that and the other and it is obvious to me what how thing work i do not understand it at all but it is not obvious .,technology
i think with this realization that there these very different way to interpret whats going on in the universe that give me at least state .,technology
it doesnt help me to understand that different interpretation but it give me at least more respect for the possibility that there will be other interpretation .,technology
yeah humbles you to the possibility that what is it reincarnation or all all these eternal recurrence with nature these idea yeah .,technology
the thing that i realized about a bunch of those thing is that ive been doing my little survey of the history of philosophy trying to understand what can i say now about some of these thing ?,technology
now we do not know how to extract it in our traditional scientific approach but it is still something where it is not a crazy thing to say there is something it doesnt weigh anything .,technology
thats a a silly question how much doe it weigh ?,technology
maybe it doesnt such a silly question in our model of physic because the actual computational activity ha a consequence of gravity and thing but thats a very subtle because if we start talking about mass and energy and on there could be a youve got a solar tron .,technology
yes yes a particle that somehow contains on this .,technology
but leibnitz had lost me at the following thing .,technology
he said each of these monad ha a soul and each of them ha a consciousness and it is i am out of here .,technology
i do not understand this at all .,technology
i do not know whats going on but i realized recently that in his day the concept that a thing could do something could spontaneously do something .,technology
that wa his only way of describing that .,technology
and what i would now say a is this abstract rule that run to leibnitz that would have been in one thousand six hundred and ninety or whatever that would have been it ha a soul it ha a consciousness .,technology
and in a sense it is one of these there an only new idea under the sun to speak thats thats a a version of the same kind of idea but couched in term that are bizarrely different from the one that we would use today .,technology
would you be able to maybe play devil advocate on your conception of consciousness that the two characteristic of it that is constrained and there a single thread of time .,technology
is it possible that leibnitz wa onto something that the basic adam the screweat adam of space ha a consciousness ?,technology
is that these are word ?,technology
but what is there ?,technology
is there some sense where consciousness is much more fundamental than your making it seem ?,technology
i think can you construct a world in which it is much more fundamental ?,technology
and what would that be ?,technology
and i think that come back to this question of can we whats it to be a cellular or a tromoton type thing ?,technology
i am not yet there .,technology
i think that this is a and i know not even know yet quite how to think about this .,technology
the bed term this is a long time ago .,technology
no it is recently .,technology
recently they said it wa terrible .,technology
thatd be interesting to see you write a short story based on what sound it is already inspiring short story by or story .,technology
thats fiction writer .,technology
but i think the the interesting thing for me is and what doe it what is it to be or whatever ?,technology
how do you describe that ?,technology
it is thats not a thing that you describe in mathematics .,technology
the what is it to be such an such ?,technology
whats he to me when you say what is it to be something presumes that you are talking about a singular entity ?,technology
there a some feeling of the entity the stuff thats inside of it and the stuff thats outside of it .,technology
and then thats when consciousness start making sense .,technology
but then it seems that could be generalizable .,technology
if you take some subset of a cellular time you could start talking about what doe that subset ?,technology
i feel but then you can i think you can take arbitrary number of subset .,technology
to me you and i individually are consciousness but you could also say the two of u together is a singular conscious .,technology
i am not sure about that .,technology
i think that the single threat of time thing may be pretty important .,technology
and that a soon a you start saying there are two different thread of time .,technology
there are two different experience .,technology
and then we have to say how do they relate how they entangled with each other ?,technology
that may be a different story of a thing that is not much what do the ant whats it to be an ant ?,technology
where there a more collective view of the world to speak .,technology
i think that this is i do not have a good my best thought is can we turn it into a human story ?,technology
it is the question of when we try and understand physic can we turn that into something which is a human understandable narrative ?,technology
and now whats it to be a such and such ?,technology
maybe the only medium in which we can describe that is something fiction where it is you are telling the life story in that in that setting but i am this is this is beyond will i what ive yet understood how to do it .,technology
sorry an ant is too low level ?,technology
maybe you have to look at the ant colony .,technology
because there some level of which it is a conscious being and then if you go to the planetary scale then maybe thats going too far .,technology
there a nice sweet spot .,technology
yeah consciousness .,technology
they are always these different everybody ha their own theory of consciousness and they are very noninter interdiscussable .,technology
and how doe it help me to say how do i go from this this incoherent collection of thing happening in the universe to our definite perception and definite law and on and that an an applied version of consciousness .,technology
and and and i think the reason it is segue to a different topic but the reason that one of the thing i am particularly interested in is whats the analog of consciousness and system very different from brain .,technology
and why is that matter ?,technology
this whole description of this we havent talked about why the universe exists .,technology
let get to why the universe exists .,technology
and then we then we can talk about perhaps a little bit about what these model of physic show you about other kind of thing molecular computing and on .,technology
but thats good .,technology
why doe the universe exist ?,technology
we finally more or le set the stage .,technology
weve got this idea of this ad of this object that is made from following all possible rule the fact that it is not this incoherent mess it is got all this entangled structure in it and on. . what is this ad ?,technology
it is the working out of all possible formal system .,technology
the the the question of why doe the universe exist ?,technology
it is core question which you started with is youve got two bus two equal four .,technology
youve got some other abstract result but thats not actualized .,technology
it is an abstract thing .,technology
and when we say weve got a model for the universe .,technology
it is this rule you run it and itll make the universe but it is but but but wheres it running ?,technology
what what what is what is it doing ? ?,technology
what what is is it actual or is it merely a formal description of something ? .,technology
the thing to realize with this with this the thing about the rule you had is it is an inevitable it is the entangled running of all possible rule .,technology
you do not get to say it is not you are saying which rule you had are you picking ?,technology
because it is all possible formal rule .,technology
it is not it is it is only footnote the only footnote it is an important footnote is it is all possible computational rule not hyper computational rule .,technology
you can even now in touring you this that you could make oracle for touring machine where you say a touring machine can not solve the whole thing problem for touring machine .,technology
you can imagine such a box .,technology
you can not necessarily build one in the physical universe but you can imagine such a box .,technology
and we could say in addition to in this rule you had we are imagining that there is a computational that at the end it is it is running rule that are computational .,technology
it doesnt have a bunch of oracle black box in it .,technology
turn out if there are oracle black box the rule that is you can make a super rule that contains those oracle black box but it ha a cosmological event horizon relative to the first one .,technology
they can not communicate .,technology
and thats what happens in an event horizon .,technology
and what will happen between this the ordinary rule you had and the hyper rule you had is there is an event horizon and we in our rule you had will never know that there is there there there separate thing .,technology
they are not they are not connected .,technology
and maybe i am not understanding but because we can not observe it .,technology
why doe that mean it doesnt exist ?,technology
it might exist but it doe it is not clear what it is what to speak whether it exists what we are trying to understand is why doe our universe exist ?,technology
we are not trying to ask the question what let me say another thing let me make a matter comment which is that i have not thought through this hyperrulead business properly .,technology
i can not the hyperrulead is referring to a rulead in which hypercomputation is possible .,technology
thats correct. . what the that footnote the footnote is we are not sure why this is important .,technology
yeah thats .,technology
it is already abstract enough .,technology
the one question is we have to say if we are saying why doe the universe exist ?,technology
one question is why is it this universe and not another universe ?,technology
the the important point about this rulead idea is that it is in the rulead are all possible formal system .,technology
there no choice being made .,technology
there no there no we picked this particular universe and not that one .,technology
thats the first thing .,technology
the second thing is that we have to ask the question .,technology
you say why doe two plus two equal four exist ?,technology
thats not a that is a thing that necessarily is that way on the basis of the meaning of the term two and plus some equal and on. . the thing is that this this rulead object is in a sense a necessary object .,technology
it is the thing that is the consequence of working out the consequence of the formal definition of thing .,technology
it is not a thing where you are saying and this is picked a the particular thing .,technology
this is something which necessarily is that thing because of the definition of what it mean to have computation .,technology
it is a rulead it is a formal system .,technology
where are we in this whole thing ?,technology
we are part of this rulead .,technology
and our there is no sense to say doe two plus two equal four exist ?,technology
thats thats in some sense it necessarily exists .,technology
it is a necessary object .,technology
it is not a thing that where you can ask it is usually in and philosophy there a distinction made between necessary tool contingent truth analytic proposition synthetic proposition they are a variety of different version of this .,technology
there are thing which are necessarily true based on the definition of term and there are thing which happen to be true in our universe .,technology
but we do not exist in a realyear space .,technology
thats one of the coordinate that define our existence .,technology
yes yes but this ad is the set of all possible old coordinate .,technology
what we are saying is it contains that .,technology
what we are saying is we exist a our perception of whats going on is where it a particular place in this ad and we are concluding certain thing about how the universe work based on that .,technology
but the question is do we understand is there something where we say why it doe it work that way ?,technology
the answer is i think it ha to work that way because this there is not this ad is a necessary object in the sense that it is a purely formal object two plus two equal four .,technology
it is not an object that wa made of something .,technology
it is an object that is an expression of the necessary collection of formal relation that exist .,technology
and then the issue is can we in our experience of that is it can we have table and chair to speak in that by virtue of our experience of that necessary thing ?,technology
and what people have generally thought and ill say that that i do not know of a lot of discussion of this .,technology
why doe the universe exist question ?,technology
it is not a random arbitrary thing it is a thing with definite structure and that structure is the thing when we are embedded in that structure when an entity embedded in that structure perceives something which is then we can interpret a physic and thing this .,technology
in other word we do not have to ask the question the the the why doe it exist ?,technology
it necessarily exists .,technology
i am missing this part .,technology
why doesnt necessarily exist ?,technology
you need to have it if you want to formalize the relation between entity but why did why do you need to have relation ?,technology
let say you say it is why doe math have to exist ?,technology
thats the same question .,technology
let see i think the thing to think about is the existence of mathematics is something where given a definition of term what follows from that definition inevitably follows .,technology
now you can say why define any term but in a sense the thats the definition of term i think the way to think about this let me see concrete term it is a very simple there are thing logical or whatever .,technology
thats a thing thats a powerful thing .,technology
it is a yeah but it is it is a the the point is that it is not a thing of that people imagine there is i do not know the an elephant or something or the elephant are presumably not necessary object .,technology
they are they happen to exist a a result of biological evolution of whatever else but the the thing is that in some sense that there is it is a different thing to say doe plus exist ?,technology
it is not it is not not an elephant .,technology
that is we can certainly say there is a formal system that we can construct abstractly in our mind that is computation .,technology
and that thats the we can we can imagine it ?,technology
now the question is is it is that formal system once we exist a observer embedded in that formal system thats enough to have something which is our universe .,technology
yeah and then what you are asking is perhaps is why the point is we definitely can imagine it .,technology
there nothing that say that we are not saying that there it is inevitable that that is a thing that we can imagine .,technology
we do not have to ask doe it exist ?,technology
we are it is definitely something we can imagine .,technology
now thats then we have this thing that is a formally constructible thing that we can imagine .,technology
and now we have to ask the question what given that formally constructible thing what is what consequence doe that if we were to perceive that formally if we were embedded in that formally constructible thing what would be perceived about the world ?,technology
and we would say we perceive that the world exists because we are we are seeing all of this mechanism of all these thing happening .,technology
and but thats something that is a feature of it is something where we are see another way of asking this i am trying to get at i understand why it feel this ruliaid is necessary .,technology
but maybe it is me being human but it feel then you should be able to not u but somehow step outside of the ruliaid .,technology
whats outside the ruliaid ?,technology
the ruliaid is all formal system .,technology
there nothing because but that is what human would say .,technology
is it possible to encode all once we is there something that is not what we can represent formally ? .,technology
you can make a world that deal with all possible rule and then merely by virtue of living in a particular place in that world to speak we have the perception we have of what the world is .,technology
ha been i would say one of the one of the one that you would think people will be most interested in but i think they are thats something complicated .,technology
indeed having written quite a few article yourself you are now missing some of the piece .,technology
and thats a weird thing because mathematics people have been very confused including me have been very confused about the the the the question of of what what is the foundation of mathematics ?,technology
what is what a thing is mathematics ?,technology
is mathematics something where we write down axiom euclid did for geometry and we build the structure and we could have written down different axiom wed have a different structure or is it something that ha a more fundamental truth to it ?,technology
what i am increasingly coming to realize is that similar to saying let take it gas and break it down into molecule .,technology
we see underside ability we see other thing this .,technology
one of the thing ive always find very mysterious is that gerdels thurum show that there are thing which can not be finitely proved in mathematics .,technology
there are proof of arbitrary length infinite length proof that you might need but in practical mathematics mathematician do not typically run into this .,technology
the law of fluid mechanic are much more understandable than this underlying molecular dynamic .,technology
thats the causal network of mathematics of what can prove what and on and you can say at any moment in the history of a mathematician of a single mathematical consciousness you are in a single slice of this metamathematical space .,technology
a certain set of mathematical statement you can then deduce with proof you can deduce other one and on you are gradually moving through metamathematical space .,technology
maybe tenzero individual little step to prove pythagoras theorem and one of the bizarre thing thats a an empirical fact i am trying to understand a little bit better .,technology
if you look at different proof if you look at different formalized mathematics system they have different axiom underneath but they can all prove pythagoras theorem .,technology
and in other word it is a little bit what happens with gas we can have air molecule we can have water molecule but they still have fluid dynamic both of them have fluid dynamic .,technology
and similarly at the level that mathematics the mathematician care about mathematics it is way above the molecular dynamic to speak .,technology
and there are all kind of weird thing for example one thing i wa realizing recently is that the quantum theory of mathematics thats a very bizarre idea .,technology
but when you prove what is a proof is youve got one statement of mathematics you go through other statement you eventually get to a statement you are trying to prove for example thats a path in mathematical space .,technology
and thats a single path a single proof is a single path .,technology
but you can imagine there are other proof of the same result .,technology
there are a bundle of proof .,technology
there this whole set of possible proof .,technology
because they give u branching similar to the quantum mechanic model that you were talking about .,technology
and then there some invariance that you can formalize and then the same way that you can for the quantum mechanical. . the question is in proof space a you start thinking about multiple proof are there analog for example destructive interference of multiple proof ?,technology
there a couple of day old not yet fully formed .,technology
but a you try and do that when you have two different proof it is two photon going in different direction .,technology
you have two proof which at an intermediate stage are incompatible .,technology
and thats destructive interference .,technology
it is a possible for this to instruct the engineering of automated proof system .,technology
there a practical matter .,technology
this whole question in fact jonathan gorard ha a nice heuristic for automated theorem proof thats based on our physic project that is looking for essentially using using energy in our model energy is the level of activity in this hypergraph .,technology
and there a heuristic for automated theorem proving about how do you pick which path to go down that is based on essentially physic ?,technology
and the thing that get interesting about this is the way that one can have the interplay between for example black hole what is a black hole in metamathematics ?,technology
the answer is what is black hole in physic ?,technology
black hole in physic is where in the simplest form of black hole time end that is all everything is crunched down to the space time singularity and everything end up at that singularity .,technology
in our model and thats a little hard to understand in general to be with continuous mathematics and what doe the singularity look ?,technology
in our model it is something very pragmatic .,technology
it is you are applying these rule time is moving forward and then there come a moment where the rule no rule apply .,technology
time stop .,technology
it is the universe dy .,technology
that nothing happens in the universe anymore .,technology
in mathematics thats a decidable theory .,technology
thats a theory .,technology
theory which have underciderability which are thing arithmetic set theory all of serious model theory in mathematics .,technology
they all have the feature that there are proof of arbitrary long length .,technology
in something boolean algebra which is a decidable theory there are any question in boolean algebra .,technology
you can go crunch crunch crunch and then a noin number of step you can answer it .,technology
satisfiability might be hard but it is still a bounded number of step to answer any satisfiability problem .,technology
and the notion of a black hole in physic where time stop thats analogous to in mathematics where there are not infinite length proof where when in physic you can wander around the universe forever if you do not run into a black hole .,technology
if you run into a black hole in time stop you are done .,technology
and it is the same thing in mathematics between decidable theory and underciderable theory .,technology
thats an example .,technology
and i think where the attempt to understand another question is what is the general activity of mathematics ?,technology
what is the bulk theory of mathematics ?,technology
in the literature mathematics there are about three million theorem that people have published .,technology
and the question is whats that for mathematics ?,technology
and a we explore what is for example for mathematics which is always like taking abstract limit .,technology
an obvious abstract limit for mathematics to take is the limit of the future of mathematics .,technology
that is what will be the ultimate structure of mathematics .,technology
and one of the thing thats an empirical observation about mathematics thats quite interesting is that a lot of theory in one array of mathematics algebraic geometry or something might have they play into another array of mathematics .,technology
that same the same a fundamental construct seem to occur in very different area of mathematics .,technology
and that structurally captured a bit with category theory and thing that .,technology
but i think that there probably an understanding of this mathematical space that will explain why different area of mathematics ultimately map into the same thing .,technology
and my little challenge to myself is whats time dilation in in mathematics .,technology
in other word a you a you a you move around in this mathematical space of possible statement whats how doe that moving around ?,technology
it is whats happening is that a you move around in the space of mathematical statement it is you are changing from algebra to geometry to whatever else .,technology
and you are trying to prove the same theorem .,technology
but a you try if you keep on moving to these different place it is slower to prove that theorem because you keep on having to translate what you are doing back to where you started from .,technology
and thats the beginning of the analog of time dilation in mathematics .,technology
class test probably fractured the mention in this space a . this space is a very messy space .,technology
this space is much messier than physical space .,technology
even in the model of physic physical space is very tame compared to branchial space and real space .,technology
the mathematical structure branchial space probably more hilbert space but it is a rather complicated hilbert space .,technology
and one of the thing you can do you can think about is youve got between statement youve got proof and they are path between statements. . now you can go to the next level and you can ask what about a mapping from one proof to another ?,technology
and thats in in category theory thats a higher category that notion of higher category where you are where you are mapping not between not between object but you are mapping between the mapping between object and on .,technology
and you can keep doing that and you keep saying higher order proof i want mapping between proof between proof and on .,technology
and that limiting structure by the way one thing thats very interesting is imagine in proof space youve got these two proof .,technology
and the question is what is the topology of proofspace ?,technology
in other word if you take these two path can you continuously deform them into each other where is there some big hole in the middle that prevents you from continuously deforming them one into the other ?,technology
it is when you when you think about some i do not know some puzzle for example you are moving piece around on some puzzle .,technology
and you can think about the space of possible state of the puzzle and you can make this graph that show from one state to the puzzle to another state of the puzzle and on .,technology
and sometimes you can easily get from one state to any other state but sometimes therell be a hole in that space and therell be you always have to go around the circuitous route to get from here to there .,technology
there will not be any direct way .,technology
and thats a question of of whether there an obstruction in the space .,technology
and the question is in proof space what is the what are what doe it mean if there an obstruction in proof space ?,technology
yeah i do not even know what an obstruction mean in proof space because for it to be an obstruction it should be reachable some other way from some other place .,technology
this is on an unreachable part of the graph .,technology
no it is not an unreachable part .,technology
it is a part where there are path that go one way there are path that go the other way .,technology
and this question of homotopi and mathematics is this question can you continuously deform from one path to another path or do you have to go in a jump to speak ?,technology
but when youve got something that wind all the way around a cylinder you can not continuously deform that down to a point because it is stuck wrapped around .,technology
my intuition about proof space is you should be of the deformant .,technology
that because then otherwise it doesnt even make sense because if the topology matter of the way you move about the space that i do not even know what that mean .,technology
what it would mean is that you would have one way of doing a proof of something over here in algebra .,technology
and another way of doing a proof of something over here in geometry and there would not be an intermediate way to map between those proof .,technology
but how would that be possible if they started the same place and ended the same place ?,technology
it is the same thing a weve got point on a if weve got pod on a cylinder .,technology
now you understand how it work in physical space but it doesnt it feel proof space shouldnt have that. . i am not sure .,technology
i do not know .,technology
well know very soon because we get to do some experiment .,technology
this is the great thing about this stuff is that in fact i am in the next few day i hope to do a bunch of experiment on this .,technology
you are playing proof in this space .,technology
this is toy theory and weve got good this segue is to perhaps another thing which is this whole idea of multi computation .,technology
this this some is another bigger idea that this ha to do with how do you make model of thing ?,technology
and it is going to it is some ive claimed that theyve been four epoch in the history of making model of thing .,technology
and and that this multi computation thing is is the fourth is a new epoch .,technology
what is the first three ?,technology
the first one is is back in antiquity .,technology
ancient greek time people were whats the universe made of ?,technology
it is made of everything is water thalies or everything is made of atom .,technology
it is what are thing made of ?,technology
or there are these crystal sphere that represent where the planet are and on .,technology
it is a structural idea of how the universe is constructed .,technology
there no real notion of dynamic .,technology
it is what is the universe ?,technology
how is the universe made ?,technology
then we get to the 1600s and we get to the revolution of mathematics being introduced into physic .,technology
and then we have this idea of you write down some equation the what happens in the universe is the solving of that equation time enters but it is usually a parameter .,technology
we can slide it back and forth and say his his where it is .,technology
then we come to this computational idea that i started pushing in the in the early 1980s a a result the thing that we were talking about before about complexity that wa my motivation .,technology
but the bigger story wa the story of computational model of thing .,technology
and the big difference there from the mathematical model is the mathematical model there an equation you solve it you go slide time to the place where you want it .,technology
in computational model you give the rule and they say go run the rule .,technology
and time is not something you get to slide time is something where it you run the rule time go in step and thats how you work out what the system behaves .,technology
you do not time is not a parameter time is something that is about the running of these of these rule .,technology
and there this computational ability ability you can not jump ahead in time but there still important thing there still one thread of time .,technology
it is still the case the cellular automaton state and it ha the next state and the next state and on .,technology
the thing that is we tipped off by quantum mechanic in a sense although it it feed back even into dual relativity and thing that that there these multiple thread of time .,technology
and in this multicomputation paradigm the idea is instead of they are being the single thread of time they are these distributed asynchronous thread of time that are happening .,technology
and the thing thats different there is if you want to know what happened if you say what happened in the system in the case of the computational paradigm you say after a thousand step we got this result .,technology
but in the multicomputation paradigm after a thousand step not even a little bit of thousand step mean because we got all these different thread of time .,technology
but there is no state .,technology
there all these different possible there all these different path .,technology
and the only way you can know what happened is to have some observer who is saying here how to parse the result of what wa going on .,technology
but that observer is embedded in they do not have a complete picture .,technology
in the case of physic thats .,technology
and then but thats but the idea is that in this multicomputation setup that it is this idea of these multiple thread of time and model that are based on that .,technology
and this is similar to what people think about in nondetermined state computation .,technology
you have a term machine usually it ha a definite state it follows another state follows another state .,technology
but typically what people have done when theyve thought about these kind of thing is theyve said there are all these possible path .,technology
and nondeterminedistic term machine can follow all these possible path but we want one of them .,technology
we want the one thats the winner that factor the number or whatever else .,technology
and similarly it is the same story in logic programming and on .,technology
but we say weve got this goal find u a path to that goal .,technology
i want one path that i am happy .,technology
or theorem proving same story .,technology
i want one proof and then i am happy .,technology
whats happening in multicomputation in physic is we care about many path .,technology
and there is a case for example probabilistic programming is a version of multicomputation in which you are looking at all the path you are asking for probability of thing .,technology
but in a sense in physic we are taking different kind of sampling for example in quantum mechanic we are taking a different sampling of all these multiple path .,technology
in other word that by the very structure of this multicomputational setup it inevitably is the case that you have certain emergent law .,technology
now why is this perhaps not surprising in thermodynamics since statistical mechanic there are inevitable emergent law of gas dynamic there are independent of the of the detail of the molecular dynamic the same thing .,technology
and then what i realized is and then you might say now weve got multicomputation it is even worse .,technology
it is one thread of time that we can not explain .,technology
it is all these thread of time .,technology
we can not explain anything .,technology
but the following thing happens because there is all this irreducibility and any detailed thing you might want to answer it is very hard to answer .,technology
but when you have an observer who ha certain characteristic computational boundedness sequentiality of time and on that observer only sample certain aspect of this incredible complexity going on in this multicomputational system .,technology
and that is sensitive only to some underlying core structure of this multicomputational system .,technology
there is all this irreducible computation going on all these detail .,technology
but to that observer whats important is only the core structure of multicomputation which mean that observer observes comparatively simple law .,technology
and i think it is inevitable that that observer observes law which are mathematically structured general television quantum mechanic which by the way are the same law in our model of physic .,technology
thats the next explanation why there simple law that explain a lot for this observer .,technology
potentially yes but what the place where this get interesting is there are all these field of science where people have gotten stuck where they say wed love to have a physic theory of economics .,technology
wed love to have a physic lore and linguistics .,technology
is that a talk about molecular biology here ?,technology
where doe multicomputation come in for biology ?,technology
eccanolics is super interesting too but biology .,technology
let talk about that .,technology
let talk about chemistry for a second .,technology
i have to say this is such a weird business for me because there are these paradigmatic idea and then the actual application .,technology
and it is ive always said i know nothing about chemistry i learned all the chemistry i know the night before some exam when i wa fourteen year old but ive learned a bunch more chemistry .,technology
and in more from language these day we have pretty nice symbolic representation of chemistry .,technology
and in understanding the design of that i am i think learned to set them out of chemistry .,technology
if you quizzed me on basic high school chemistry i would probably fail .,technology
but but what is chemistry ?,technology
chemistry is a story of chemical reaction are youve got this particular chemical thats represented a some graph of these are this configuration of molecule with these bond and on .,technology
and a chemical reaction happens .,technology
youve got these two graph .,technology
they interact in some way .,technology
youve got another graph or multiple other graph out .,technology
thats the the the abstract view of whats happening in chemistry .,technology
and when you do a chemical synthesis for example you are given certain these are possible reaction that can happen .,technology
and your ask can you piece together this a sequence of such reaction a sequence of such axiomatic reaction usually called name reaction in chemistry ?,technology
can you piece together a sequence of these reaction that you get out at the end this great molecule we were trying to synthesize .,technology
and thats a story of very much theorem proving .,technology
and people have done they started in the 1960s looking at the theorem proving approach to that although it did not it did not it did not done too early i think .,technology
but anyway thats the view is that chemistry chemical reaction are the story of all these different path of possible thing that go on .,technology
let let go to an even lower level .,technology
let say instead of asking about which specie of molecule we are talking about let look at individual molecule .,technology
and let say we are looking at individual molecule and they are having chemical reaction and we are building up this big graph of all these reaction that are happening .,technology
then weve got this big graph and by the way that big graph is incredibly similar to this hypergraphy writing thing .,technology
but then you have to there a lot of work to be done on update rule .,technology
in term of what they offer chemistry ?,technology
yeah but they are for our observed chemistry .,technology
yes indeed yes indeed .,technology
weve been working on that because we have this beautiful system and well from language for representing chemistry symbolically .,technology
we have this is a this is an ongoing thing to figure out what they offer some practical case .,technology
doe that require human injection or can it be automatically discovered these update rule ?,technology
in the boundary chemistry better we can probably discover the modematic that i think in in reality now it is they are these particular reaction .,technology
and to understand whats going on we are probably going to pick a particular subtype of chemistry and because explain where this is going .,technology
the place that here where this is going .,technology
got this whole network of all these molecule having all these reaction and on .,technology
and this is some whole multi computational story because each each chemical reaction event is it own separate event where we are saying they all happen asynchronously .,technology
we are not describing in what order they happen maybe that order is governed by some quantum mechanic thing doesnt matter .,technology
we are saying they happen in some order .,technology
and then we ask what is the whats the how do we think about the system ?,technology
this thing is some big multi computational system .,technology
the question is what is the chemical observer ?,technology
and one possible chemical observer is all you care about is did you make that particular drug molecule ?,technology
you are asking for the one path no thing you might care about is i want to know the concentration of each specie .,technology
i want to know at every stage i am going to solve the differential equation that represent the concentration and i want to know what those all are .,technology
but there more because when it is you are going below in statistical mechanic there all these molecule bouncing around and you might say we are going to ignore we are going to look at the aggregate density of certain kind of molecule .,technology
but you can look at a lower level you can look at this whole graph of possible interaction .,technology
and the the idea would be what is the only chemical observer one who care about overall concentration ?,technology
or can there be a chemical observer who care about this network of what happened ?,technology
and that the question then is let me give an analogy .,technology
this is where i think this is potentially very relevant to molecular biology molecular computing .,technology
when we think about a computation usually we say it is input it is output we or chemistry we say there this input we are going to make this molecule a the output .,technology
but what if what we encode what if our computation what other thing we care about is some part of this dynamic network ?,technology
what if it is not the input and the output that we care about ?,technology
what if there some dynamic of the network that we care about ?,technology
now imagine you are a chemical observer what is a chemical observer ?,technology
in molecular biology there are all kind of weird sort of observer there are membrane that exist that have different kind of molecule that combine to them thing this .,technology
it is not obvious that the from a human scale we measure the concentration of something is the relevant story .,technology
we can imagine that for example when we look at this whole network of possible reaction we can imagine a physical level we can imagine what wa the actual momentum direction of that of that molecule ?,technology
what wa it which we do not pay any attention to when we are talking about chemical concentration ?,technology
what wa the orientation of that molecule ?,technology
these kind of thing .,technology
and here the place where i have a little suspicion ?,technology
one of the question in biology is what matter in biology ?,technology
and that is we have all these chemical reaction we have all these all these molecular process going on in biological system what matter ?,technology
and one of the thing is to be able to tell what matter a big story of the what matter question wa what happened in genetics in one thousand nine hundred and fifty three when dna when it wa figured out how dna worked .,technology
because before that time genetics have been all these different effect and complicated thing and then it wa realized there something new a molecule constor information which wasnt obvious before that time .,technology
a single molecule constor information .,technology
there a place where there can be something important thats happening in molecular biology and it is in the sequence thats storing information in a molecule .,technology
the possibility now is imagine this dynamic network this causal graph and multiway causal graph and on that represent all of these different reaction between molecule .,technology
what if there is some aspect of that that is storing information thats relevant for molecular biology ?,technology
in the dynamic aspect of that ?,technology
yes thats .,technology
that it is similar to how the structure of a dna molecule store information .,technology
it could be the dynamic of the system some of the store information and this process might allow you to give prediction of what that would be .,technology
yes but also imagine that you are trying to do for example imagine you are trying to do molecular computation .,technology
you might think the way we are going to do molecular computation is we are going to run the thing we are going to see what came out .,technology
we are going to see what molecule came out .,technology
this is saying thats not the only thing you can do .,technology
there is a different chemical observer that you can imagine constructing which is somehow sensitive to this dynamic network .,technology
exactly how that work how we make that measurement i do not know but a few idea but thats whats important to speak .,technology
and that mean by the way you can do the same thing even for turn machine you can say if you have a multilayturing machine you can say how do you compute with a multilayturing machine ?,technology
you can not say what we got this input and this output because the thing ha all these thread of time it is got lot of output .,technology
and then you say what doe it even mean to be a universal multilayturing machine ?,technology
i do not fully know the answer to that .,technology
it is an interesting idea who would freak touring out for sure because then the dynamic of the trajectory the computation matter .,technology
yes yes but the thing is that this is again a story of whats the observer to speak can chemistry whats the observer that ?,technology
is it some cell sitting in our bone marrow that is living for the whole of our life thats going to spring into action a soon a we are shown the same antigen or is it something different from that ?,technology
is it something more dynamic ?,technology
when you say shape space the shape of the molecule this is it could be deeply connected to the protein the multiproaching folding all of that stuff .,technology
to be able to say something interesting about the the dance of protein thats exactly that .,technology
then ha an impact on helping develop drug for example or ha an impact on biology immunology helping .,technology
i think the biggest thing is when we think about molecular biology the what what is the qualitative way to think about it ?,technology
in other word is it chemical reaction network ? ?,technology
is it genetics dna big big news it is of there a digital aspect of the whole thing .,technology
what is the qualitative way to think about how thing work in biology ?,technology
and the question is what is the overarching representation that we can now start to think about using a microbiology ?,technology
it is in the dynamic structure of this network .,technology
and thats the thats the the the the potential there and it is it is these thing are i do not know it is it is for me it is it is i am not that wa not a a view .,technology
i thought about molecular computing for age and age and age and age .,technology
and ive always imagined that the big story is the the original promise of nanotechnology of can we make a molecular scale constructor that will build build a molecule in any shape ?,technology
i do not think i am now increasingly concluding thats not the big point .,technology
the big point is something more dynamic that will be an interesting end point for any of these thing but thats perhaps not the thing because the one example we have i am computing thats working is a biological organism .,technology
and maybe the thing thats important there is not this what chemical do you make to speak but more this dynamic process .,technology
dynamic process and then you can have a good model the hypografted to the explorer what simulated again make prediction and if they i think have a way to reason about biology .,technology
it is hard by first of all biology doesnt have theory physic .,technology
physic is a much more successful global theory area .,technology
biology whether the global theory of biology pretty much darwinian evolution thats the only global theory of biology .,technology
are there any other theory say the kidney work this way the this thing work this way and on .,technology
there is not i suppose another global theory is digital information in dna .,technology
thats another global fact about biology .,technology
but the difficult thing to do is to match something you have a model of in the hypografted the actual how do you discover the theory ?,technology
how do you discover the theory ?,technology
you have something that look nice and make sense but you have to match it to validation and make sure .,technology
and thats tricky because you are walking around the dark .,technology
not entirely .,technology
for example and what weve been trying to think about is take actual chemical reactions. . one of my goal is can i compute the prime with molecule ?,technology
thats if i can do that then i maybe i can compute thing .,technology
and there this nice automated lab these guy these emerald cloud lab people have built with wolf and lange and on .,technology
that would be that would be an example of where and that would be with a particular framework for doing the molecular computing with particular kind of molecule and there a lot of ambient technological mess to speak associated with is it carbon ?,technology
is it that is it important that there a bromine atom here etc etc etc etc .,technology
this is all chemistry that i do not know much about .,technology
and thats a unfortunately thats down at the level i would to be at the software level not at the level of the transistor to speak .,technology
but in chemistry there a certain amount we have to do i think at the level of transistor before we get up to being able to do it although automated lab certainly help in setting that up .,technology
i talked to a guy named charles hoskinson .,technology
he mentioned that he collaborating with you .,technology
he an interesting guy .,technology
he sends me paper on speaking of automated theorem proving a lot .,technology
he exceptionally read on that area a . whats the nature of your collaboration with him ?,technology
he the creator of cardano or the nature of the color collaboration between cardano and the whole space of blockchain and we are from alpha we are from blockchain are that stuff ?,technology
we are segueing to a we are a slightly different world but although not completely unconnected the whole thing is somehow connected .,technology
i know i know the strange thing in my life is ive alternated between doing basic science and doing technology about five time in my life far .,technology
and the thing thats crazy about it is every time i do one of these alternation i think there not going to be a way back to the other thing .,technology
and i thought for this physic project i thought we are doing fundamental theory of physic maybe itll have an application in two hundred year .,technology
but now ive realized this multicomputation idea is applicable here and now it is an in fact it is also giving u this way .,technology
ill mention one of the thing and then then well talk about blockchain .,technology
what do you mean one third of a century is in mean thirty three or thirty what are we first three or third ?,technology
thirty three or thirty three .,technology
but ive never heard of anyone celebrating that anniversary but i it .,technology
and it is i think it is cool that we can still run mathematical version one program today and on and weve maintained compatibility and weve been building this big tower all those year of more and more and more computational capability .,technology
it is interesting we made this picture of the different thread of of computational content of mathematical content and all sort of thing with data and graph and whatever else .,technology
and what in this picture is about the first ten year it is it is a few thread .,technology
and then then about maybe fifteen twenty year of explodes in this whole collection of different thread of all these different capability that are now part of all from language and representing different thing in the world .,technology
but the thing that wa super lucky in some sense is it is all based on one idea .,technology
it is all based on the idea of symbolic expression and transformation rule for symbolic expression which wa what i originally put into this sp system back in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine that wa a predecessor of the whole of language stack .,technology
that idea wa an idea that i got from trying to understand mathematical logic and on .,technology
it wa my attempt to make a general human comprehensible model of computation of everything a a symbolic expression and all you do is transform some market prescience .,technology
and in retrospect i wa very lucky that i understood a little a i understood then because had i understood more i would have been completely freaked out about all the different way that that model can fail .,technology
because what do you do when you have a symbolic expression you make transformation for symbolic expression ?,technology
for example one question is there maybe many transformation that could be made in a very multicomputational way .,technology
but what we are doing is picking we are using the first transformation that applies .,technology
and we keep doing that until we reach a fixed point .,technology
and thats the result .,technology
and thats a very it is a way of sliding around the edge of multicomputation .,technology
and back when i wa working on smp and thing i thought about these question about how how what determines the this evaluation path .,technology
for example you work out fibonacci .,technology
fibonacci is a recursive thing .,technology
and you get this whole tree of recursion ?,technology
and there the question of how do you evaluate that tree of recursion ?,technology
depth first where you go all the way down one side .,technology
do you do it breadth first ?,technology
or you are collecting the term together ?,technology
or that f of eight plus f of seven f of seven plus f of six .,technology
you can collect the f of 7 . and on these are i did not realize that at the time funny i wa working on on gauge field theory back in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine .,technology
and i wa also working on the evaluation model in smp under the same problem .,technology
but it took me forty more year to realize that .,technology
and this question about how you do this evaluation front ?,technology
thats a question of reference frame .,technology
it is a question of the story of that thats that is this question of in what order is the universe evaluated ?,technology
and that and what you realize is there this whole world of different kind of computation that you can do multicomputationally .,technology
and thats a thats an interesting thing and ha a lot of implication for distributed computing and on .,technology
it also ha a potential implication for blockchain which we havent fully worked out which is some and this is not what we are doing with cardano but this is a different thing .,technology
the this is something where one of the question is when you have in a sense blockchain is a deeply sequentialised story of time .,technology
because in blockchain there one copy of the of the ledger and you are saying this is what happened time is progressed in this way .,technology
yeah but distributed consensus that still ha a sequential there still sequentiality to tell me you are thinking through how to apply multicomputation to blockchain yes .,technology
it is whats happening is there different path of history that correspond to in one path of history youve got paid this amount in another path of history youve got paid this amount .,technology
in the end the universe will always become consistent .,technology
now the way it work is it is a little bit more complicated than that .,technology
what happens is the way space knitted together in our theory of physic is through all these event .,technology
and the the the idea is that the way that economic space knitted together is but is there these autonomous event that essentially knitted together economic space .,technology
there are all these thread of transaction that are happening and the question is can they be made consistent ?,technology
are there is there something forcing them to be a consistent fabric of economic reality ?,technology
and what this ha led me to is trying to realize how doe economics fundamentally work ?,technology
and what is economics ?,technology
and what are the atom of economics to speak ?,technology
and what ive realized is that that the perhaps i do not even know if this is yet .,technology
there event and economics that transaction there are state of agent that are the atom of economics .,technology
and then transaction are agent transact and some the the the transites in some way and thats an event .,technology
and then the question is how do you knit together economics space from that ?,technology
what is there an economic space ?,technology
all these transaction there a whole complicated collection of possible transaction .,technology
but one thing thats true about economics is we tend to have the notion of a definite value for thing .,technology
we could imagine that you buy a cookie from somebody and they want to get a movie ticket and there is some way that ai bot could make some path from the cookie to the movie ticket by all these different intermediate transaction .,technology
and my my guess is that the yet again it is crazy that all these thing are connected .,technology
this is another multicomputation story another story of where whats happening is that the economic consciousness the economic observer is not going to deal with all of those a different microscopic transaction .,technology
they are going to parse the whole thing by saying there this value it is a number .,technology
and thats thats their understanding of their summary of this economic network .,technology
and there will be all kind of thing their all kind of arbitrage opportunity which are the quantum effect and this whole thing .,technology
and thats and place where there different path that can be followed and on .,technology
and the question is come one make a global theory of economics .,technology
and then my test case say again what is time dilation in economics ?,technology
and you can get a little bit of an analogy there .,technology
but i think there a there a better and more complete analogy .,technology
and thats the question of is there a theory general relativity that is a global theory of economics ?,technology
and is it about something we care about ?,technology
if i am prepared to wait a while then itll be much more certain .,technology
and there is there a way of using and weve made a bunch of prototype of this which i am not yet happy with but i realized is to understand these prototype i have to have a foundational theory of economics .,technology
and thats a it may be that we could deploy up one of these prototype a a practical system but i think it is going to be much better if we have an understanding of how this plug into economics .,technology
that mean a fundamental theory of transaction between entity .,technology
thats how you mean by economics .,technology
yes i think but how they are emerged law of economics .,technology
i do not even know when ive been asking friend of mine who are economist and thing what is economics ?,technology
is it an axiomatic theory ?,technology
is it a theory that is a a qualitative description theory ?,technology
is it what a theory is it ?,technology
and it is not a mathematical story .,technology
it is a story of a different type of thinking about these thing .,technology
by the way evolution or biology is yet another place where it look this multicompetational idea can be applied .,technology
and thats where we are maybe speciation is related to thing event horizon and a a whole whole other world of that .,technology
but because it seems this model can be applicable a many aspect the different level of understanding of our reality .,technology
it can be the biology of the chemistry the physic level the economics and you can potentially say the thing is it is sure at all these level it might rhyme it might make sense a a model .,technology
the question is can you make useful prediction a one of these level ?,technology
and thats a question of it is a weird situation because the situation where the model probably ha definite consequence the question is are they consequence we care about ?,technology
and thats some and in the case of in the economic case the we are one thing is this idea of using physic notion to construct to distribute it analog of blockchain .,technology
the much more pragmatic thing is a different direction .,technology
and it ha to do with this computational language that we built to describe the world that know about different kind of cooky and know about different city and know about how to compute all these kind of thing .,technology
one of the thing that is of interest is if you want to run the world you need with with contract and law and rule and on there are rule at a human level and there are thing and this this get one into the idea of computational contract .,technology
now when we write a contract it is a piece of legalese it is it is written in english and it is not something thats automatically analyzable executable whatever else .,technology
it is english back in got freedliving it is back in one thousand six hundred and eighty or whatever wa figure out how to use logic to decide legal case and on .,technology
and he had this idea of let make a computational language for the human law forget about modeling nature forgot about natural law what about human law can we make a computational representation of that ?,technology
i think finally we are close to being able to do that .,technology
it is finishing the job of being able to represent everything the conversation we are having in computational term .,technology
and one of the use case for that is computational contract .,technology
another use case is something the the constitution that say what the ai is what we want the ai to do .,technology
but this is useful you are saying these are you are saying computation contract but the smart contract this is whats in the domain of cryptocurrency is known a smart contract .,technology
and the language youve developed this symbolic or seek to further develop symbolic discourse language enables you to write a contract in to contract that originally represents the sum a particular world yeah .,technology
but smart contract tend to be now mostly about thing happening on the blockchain .,technology
sometimes they have article and in fact wolf malfa api is the main thing people use to get information about the real world to speak within smart contract .,technology
wolf malfa a it stand is a good oracle .,technology
whoever want to use it thats perhaps where the relationship with the current down over .,technology
yeah how we started getting involved with block chance we realized people were using wolf malfa a the oracle for smart contract to speak .,technology
and that got u interested in block chance in general .,technology
and what wa ended up happening is wolf and language is with it symbolic representation of thing is very good at representing thing block chain .,technology
and weve weve published some sample of how that work .,technology
but but it is because our technology stack both in language and mathematical are very widely used in the quant finance world there a there a immediate coevolution there of the quant finance thing and block chain analytics .,technology
and thats some .,technology
it is the representation of block chain in computational language .,technology
then ultimately it is how do you run the world with code ?,technology
and there a there a whole story to to that .,technology
and of course i i to always pay attention to the latest thing that are going on and i i i block chain because it is a it is a it is another rethinking of computation .,technology
and it is cloud computing wa a little bit of that of persistent computational resource and on .,technology
and this multicomputation is a big rethinking of what it mean to compute .,technology
block chain is another bit of rethinking of what it mean to compute the idea that you lodge these autonomous lump of computation out there in the blockchain world .,technology
and one of the thing that for fun to speak is weve been doing a bit of stuff with nfts and we did some nfts on godana and we are doing some more .,technology
and we did some cellular autonomous nfts on godana where he quite a bit .,technology
and ive i do not think this is it is realizing maybe it is not coincidental that i am the human who recorded more about themselves than anybody else .,technology
and then i end up with these science result let say history matter which wa not those those thing i did not think those were connected but there at least correlating yes .,technology
but that mean that pay once and you are you are lodged in the blockchain forever .,technology
and weve been playing around with the a hobby thing of mine of thinking about the nfts and how you the consumer idea of the it is the it is the anti it is the opposite of the snapchat view of the world .,technology
there a permanent to it this heavily incentivized and thereby you are going to have permanence of history. . and thats the now thats thats one of the thing weve been doing with cardano and it is fun .,technology
i think that that this whole question about you mentioned automated theorem proving and block chain and on .,technology
and a ive thought about this physic inspired distributed blockchain obviously there the the proof that it work that there no double spends there no whatever else .,technology
that proof becomes a very formal almost a matter of physic to speak .,technology
and it is been it is been an interesting thing for the for the practical block chain to do actual automated theorem proving and i do not think anybodys managed it in an interesting case yet .,technology
it is a thing that people aspire to but i think it is a challenging thing because the point is one of the one of the thing about proving correctness of something is people say ive got this program and i am going to prove it is correct .,technology
and it is what doe that mean ?,technology
you have to say what correct mean ?,technology
it is it is then you have to have another language and people very confused back and pause decade of we are going to prove the correctness by representing the program and another language which we also do not know whether it is correct .,technology
and often by correctness we mean it can not crash or it can not scribble or memory but the thing is that there this complicated tradeoff because a soon a there a soon a you are using computation you have computational irreducibility you have an asideability .,technology
if you want to use computation you have to let go of the idea that you are going to be able to box it in and say we are going to have this happen and not anything else .,technology
this is an old fact .,technology
godless theorem try to say piano arithmetic the axon of arithmetic can you box in the integer and say these axon give the integer and nothing but the integer .,technology
godless theorem showed that wasnt the case .,technology
there a you can have all these wild weird thing that are obey the piano axon but on integer .,technology
and there this infinite hierarchy of additional axon you would have to add .,technology
and it is the same thing .,technology
you do not get to if you want to say i want to know what happens you are boxing yourself in and there a limit to what can happen to speak .,technology
it is a complicated tradeoff and it is a it is a it is a big tradeoff for ai to speak .,technology
it is do you want to let computation do what it can do ?,technology
or do you want to say no it is very very boxed into the point where we can understand every step .,technology
and thats a thats a thing that that that becomes difficult to do .,technology
but thats some in general i would say one of the thing thats complicated in my life and the whole story of computational language and all this technology and science and on .,technology
i in the flow of one life it is interesting to see how these thing play out because i ive concluded that the business of making artifact from the future which mean there are thing that ive done .,technology
i do not know this physic project .,technology
i do not know where anybody would have gotten to it for fifty year .,technology
the fact that mathematics is a third of a century old and i know that the bunch of the core idea are not absorbed .,technology
that is people finally got this idea that i thought wa a triviality of notebook .,technology
that wa twenty five year .,technology
and some of these core idea about symbolic computation and on and not absorbed .,technology
people people use them every day in wolf from language and do all kind of cool thing with them .,technology
but if you say what is the fundamental intellectual point here ?,technology
it is it is not absorbed .,technology
and it is something where you realize that you are building thing and i i made this this thing about we are building artifact from the future to speak .,technology
and i mentioned that it is our we have a conference every coming up in a couple of week annual technology conference where we talk about all the all the thing we are doing .,technology
but but then i i realized people were telling me afterwards thats exactly how we are using wolf and language in some particular setting and some computational x field or some organization or whatever .,technology
and it is people are saying what did you manage to do ?,technology
what we know that imprint the bullet will be possible to do that .,technology
but we did not know that wa possible now .,technology
and it is thats the thats the business we are in .,technology
i think we nailed that .,technology
the answer is in the computational universe even simple program make it and thats the secret that nature ha that allows you to make it .,technology
thats the thats that part .,technology
but the bigger picture there wa this idea of this computational paradigm the idea that you could go beyond mathematical equation which have been the primary modeling medium for three hundred year .,technology
and it wa look it is an extraably the case that people will use program rather than equation .,technology
to be fair i now realize on a little bit more analysis of what people said in pretty much every field other than physic people said these are new model .,technology
thats pretty interesting .,technology
in physic people were weve got our physic model .,technology
we are very happy with them .,technology
physic there more resistance because of the attachment and the power of the equations. . the idea that program might be the way to approach this field that wa there some resistance .,technology
and you are saying it take time for somebody who like the idea of time dilation and all these application i thought you would understand this .,technology
but but and computational energy stability .,technology
yes exactly .,technology
but but it is interesting that twenty year the span of twenty year it is gone from pitchfork and horror to yeah we get it .,technology
and it is helped that weve in our current effort and environmental physic weve gotten a lot further .,technology
and weve managed to put a lot of puzzle piece together that make sense .,technology
but the thing that ive been thinking about recently is this field of complexity .,technology
ive wa a a field builder back in the 1980s .,technology
i wa can we id understood this point that there wa a fundamental phenomenon of complexity .,technology
it showed up in lot of place .,technology
and i wa this is an interesting field of science .,technology
and i wa recently wa reminded i wa at this the very first get together of what became the santa fe institute .,technology
and i wa in fact there even an audio recording of me saying people have been talking about or what should this outfit do and i wa saying there is this thing that ive been thinking about .,technology
it is this idea of complexity .,technology
and it is and thats thats what that ended up in the plant .,technology
and you plan to see the complexity of santa fe a beautiful a the beautiful vision .,technology
but that but whats happened then is this idea of complexity and kind and i started the first research center at university of illinois for doing that and the first journal complex system and on .,technology
and it is an interesting thing in my life at least that it is you plant this seed .,technology
you have this idea .,technology
it is a a science idea .,technology
you have this idea of focusing on the phenomenon of complexity .,technology
the deeper idea wa this computational paradigm .,technology
but the nominal idea is this idea of complexity .,technology
then you roll time forward thirty year or whatever thirty five year whatever it is .,technology
and you say what happened ?,technology
now there are a thousand complexity institute around the world .,technology
i think more or le weve been trying to count them .,technology
and there are forty complexity journal i think .,technology
and it is what happened in this field ?,technology
and i look at a lot of what happened and i am i have to admit to some eye rolling it is peak .,technology
because it is what is whats going on ?,technology
what people definitely got wa this idea of computational model .,technology
and then they got but they thought one of the cognitive mistake i think is they say weve got a computational model .,technology
and it and we are looking at a system thats complex .,technology
and our computational model give complexity .,technology
by godly that must mean it is .,technology
and unfortunately because complexity is a generic phenomenon the computationality of the disability is a generic phenomenon that tell you nothing .,technology
and then the question is what can you do ?,technology
there a lot of thing that have been done under this banner of complexity .,technology
and the thing ha been very successful in providing an interdisciplinary way of connecting different field together and powerful in itself. . thats a very useful mechanism .,technology
yeah it is. . it is a little nice and principle .,technology
but in the end a lot of that is around this computational paradigm computational modeling thats the raw material that power that that correspondence i think .,technology
and the question is what is the i wa thinking recently weve been the other weve been weve been for year people have told me you should start some wolfman institute that doe basic science .,technology
what i have is a company that build software and we we have a little piece that doe basic science a a hobby .,technology
people are saying you should start this wolfman institute thing .,technology
and ive been because ive known about lot of institute and ive seen their flow of money and what happens in different situation and on .,technology
ive been reluctant but ive but ive i have realized that what weve done with our company over the last thirty five year we built a very good machine for doing rd and innovating and creating thing .,technology
and i applied that machine to the physic project .,technology
thats how we did the physic project in a fairly short amount of time with efficient machine with various people involved and on .,technology
and it work for basic science and it is we can do more of this .,technology
and no arjun can not we say it is become an institute .,technology
yes it need to become an institute .,technology
and thats crucial .,technology
the thing that i wa thinking about what do we do with complexity ?,technology
what what there are all these people who what what should happen to that field .,technology
and what i realized is there this area of foundation of complexity thats about these question about simple program what they do thats far away from a bunch of the detail of application that people it is not far away .,technology
it is the it is the under the the bedrock underneath those application .,technology
i realized recently this is my recent little innovation of a sort a post that ill do very soon .,technology
they are about the foundation of complexity what are there ?,technology
i think there are two idea two conceptual idea that i hadnt enunciated i think before one is what i call metamodeling the other is rulliology .,technology
what is metamodeling ?,technology
metamodeling is youve got this complicated model and it is a model of hedgehog interacting with this interacting with that .,technology
and the question is whats underneath that ?,technology
what is it ?,technology
is it a touring machine ?,technology
what is the underlying stuff underneath that model ?,technology
and there this metastion a question of given these model what is the core model ?,technology
and i realized to me thats a lot of obvious question but then i realized ive been doing language design for forty year and language design is exactly that question .,technology
underneath all of this detailed stuff people do what are the underlying primitive ?,technology
and thats a question people havent tended to ask about model .,technology
they say weve got this nice model for this and that and the other whats underneath it ?,technology
and what because once you have the thing thats underneath it for example this multicompetition idea is an ultimate metamodling idea because it is saying underneath all these field is one paradigmatic structure .,technology
and you can imagine the same thing that much more much shallower level in different kind of modeling .,technology
the first activity is this metamodling the the model about model to speak .,technology
what is the whats whats drilling down into model ?,technology
thats one thing .,technology
the other thing is this thing that i think we are going to call rulialogy which is the youve got these simple rule youve got cellular automaton youve got terrain machine youve got substitution system youve got registered machine youve got all these different thing .,technology
what do they do in the wild ?,technology
it is youve got some what is it is it mathematics ?,technology
no it is not mathematics .,technology
in fact from my now understanding of mathematics i understand that it is the molecular dynamic level .,technology
it is not the level that mathematician have traditionally cared about .,technology
it is not computer science because computer science is about writing program that do thing that were for a purpose not program in the wild to speak .,technology
it is not physic it doesnt have anything to do with it may be underneath some physic but it is not physic a such .,technology
it hasnt had a home .,technology
it is still here today .,technology
you find an icosdehedron that somebody made an ancient egypt .,technology
thats a very modern thing .,technology
it is an icosdehedron .,technology
it is a timeless activity .,technology
and this idea of studying simple rule and what they do it is a timeless activity .,technology
and i can see that over the last forty year or a even with cellular automaton it is you can catalogue what are the different cellular automaton used for ?,technology
and the simplest rule one you might even know this one rule one hundred and eighty four .,technology
it is some rule one hundred and eighty four is a minimal model for road traffic flow .,technology
and it is also a minimal model for various other thing .,technology
but it is fun that you can say rule ninety is a minimal model for this and this and this and this rule four is a minimal model for this .,technology
and it is remarkable that you can buy in this rural level of this study of rule they then branched their their the raw material that you can use to make model of different thing .,technology
it is a it is a very pure basic science .,technology
but it is one that people have explored it but theyve been a little bit in the wilderness .,technology
and i think one of the thing that i would to do finally is i wa thought that this notion of pure and chaos pure and and chaos being the acronym for my book new science wa something that people should be doing .,technology
and we tried to figure out whats the institutional structure to do this stuff ?,technology
we dealt with a bunch of university can we do this here ?,technology
what department would be in a it is not in a department it is it own new thing .,technology
thats why thats why the book wa called the new science .,technology
it is the because thats an increasingly good description of what it is to speak .,technology
we are where we were thinking about the logical society because we are realizing that it is it is some it is very it is very interesting .,technology
ive never done something this before because there this whole group of researcher who have been doing thing that are in some case very elegant very surviving very solid here this thing that happens in this very abstract system .,technology
but it is it is what is that part of ?,technology
it is it doesnt have a home .,technology
and i think thats something i fault myself for not having been more when complexity wa developing in the 80 i did not understand the the the danger of application .,technology
that is it is cool that you can apply the stikonomics and you can apply it to the illusion of biology and this and that and the other .,technology
but what happens with application is everything get sucked into the application .,technology
and the pure stuff it is the pure mathematics .,technology
there is not any pure mathematics to speak .,technology
it is all application at mathematics .,technology
and i i failed to make sure that this pure area wa wa maintained and and and developed .,technology
and i think now one of the thing i i want to try to do and and it is a funny thing because i am used to look ive been a tech ceo from more than half my life now .,technology
this is what i know how to do .,technology
and i can i can make stuff happen and get project to happen even a it turn out basic science project in that setting and and how that translates into there are a lot of people working on for example our physic project distributed through the academic world .,technology
and thats working great .,technology
but the question is can we have a accelerated to mechanism that make use of what weve learnt in our rd innovation ?,technology
and but on the other hand it is a funny thing because in a company in the end the thing is it is a company .,technology
it make product it is solving cell thing to people .,technology
when you are doing basic research one of the challenge is there is not that same mechanism .,technology
and thats the challenge when you have the economics of the world are such that when you are delivering a product people say thats useful .,technology
well buy it .,technology
and then that feed back in then you can then you can pay the people who build it to eat they can eat and on .,technology
and with basic science the the payoff is very much le visible .,technology
and and with this physic project a i say the big surprise ha been that for example the big surprise with the physic project is that it is look it ha nearterm application .,technology
and i wa i am guessing this is two hundred year away .,technology
it is it is i wa using the analogy of of newton starting a satellite launch company which would have been wrong time .,technology
and but but it turn out thats not the case but we can not guarantee that .,technology
and if you say we are signing up to do basic research basic allogy let say and and we can not we do not know the horizon it is an unknown horizon .,technology
it is an undecidable proposition of when is this proof going to end to speak when is it going to be something that that that they get supplied ?,technology
i i hope this is this becomes a vibrant new field of allogy .,technology
i told you many many time it is one of the most amazing idea that ha been brought to this world .,technology
i hope you get a bunch of people to explore this world .,technology
thank you once again for spending your valuable title in me today .,technology
thank you .,technology
thanks for listening to this conversation with stephen wolfram .,technology
to support this podcast please check out our sponsor in the description .,technology
and now let me leave you some word from richard feynman .,technology
nature us only the longest thread to weave her pattern .,technology
each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry .,technology
thank you for listening and hope to see you next time .,technology
welcome to the in early podcast where i speak to those at the forefront of the digital asset and technology sector telling reallife story considering the growth and growing pain of the industry and exploring how blockchain and other technology ha made an impact on people life .,technology
my name is matt green and i head up blockchain digital asset and technology dispute at law firm lauren stevens .,technology
this week i speak to professor sarah green who finished a fouryear tenure a the law commissioner for commercial and common law predominantly dealing with all thing digital including drafting various iteration of the law commission paper on digital asset .,technology
we speak about the journey of crypto asset becoming property of common law and why that wa important to where we are now with legislation looking to define thing a property using a negative definition proposed by the judiciary .,technology
sarah is now the head of digital asset and trade finance at d2 legal technology and a professor of law at bristol university .,technology
i hope you enjoy this episode .,technology
hi it is nice to be here .,technology
thanks very much .,technology
your about page on linkedin is absolutely not messing around .,technology
it say and i quote professor sarah green wa law commissioner for common and common and commercial law at the law commission of england and wale from two thousand and twenty to two thousand and twenty four .,technology
during that time her law reform work included the electronic trade document act two thousand and twenty three advice to the government on smart contract updating the arbitration act of one thousand nine hundred and ninety six scoping reform to the law of intermediated security did i say that ?,technology
yeah about and drafting guidance and a bill to ensure that english law is suited to accommodate digital asset .,technology
hopefully i got most of that .,technology
in short how did you get to that point in your life where you are doing all these thing ?,technology
a an academic most of those thing i had written about for the best part of twenty year which is pretty scary looking back on it now .,technology
but i started life a a software developer at accenture and then went back to law did a law degree went to accenture then went back to law .,technology
i had a natural interest in the way that the law interacts with technology .,technology
id been writing for a while about how the law wa going to have to change or i thought the law wa going to have to change to accommodate technological development .,technology
and then at about the same time the law commission and the government were looking for people to talk about that and to make law reform along those line .,technology
and the job came up at the time .,technology
there are not that many private lawyer who were interested in the technology side of thing .,technology
they tended to want to ignore it .,technology
i got the job and it wa a dream job at a dream time because it wa two thousand and twenty .,technology
it made that a lot easier .,technology
it wa a silver lining to the whole case .,technology
it wa an easier sell .,technology
it wa a much easier sell .,technology
it wa a much easier sell .,technology
yeah much easier .,technology
and for the sake of those who do not know and again i always mentioned my dad on this but for the sake of maybe my dad let run through a couple of those or a few .,technology
can you summarize what work you did on the electronic trade document act two thousand and twenty three for starter ?,technology
yeah absolutely .,technology
that is my baby .,technology
thats the thing that ive been .,technology
your face is lit up .,technology
yeah it is something that ive been writing about since two thousand and five i think .,technology
this is a long a long a long project .,technology
because it became clear to me a i said with my technological background i realized that the law a it stood wasnt going to be able to accommodate what commercial party wanted to start using which is electronic document .,technology
now i know people will be thinking everybody us electronic document .,technology
i send pdfs all the time .,technology
we do not whats the big legal first ?,technology
but the point is and this is the boring lawyer lord bitwell is not boring to me but it is absolutely essential to understand why we needed that act is that legally there are certain document that had before that act to be in physical form .,technology
why is that ?,technology
because the law required them to be held and transferred and possessed in order to work .,technology
you get these document when you sell good .,technology
there these document for instance called bill of lading which are document which represent for instance good on a ship .,technology
and if youve got that document in your hand it is incredibly valuable because there is a legal alchemy that occurs which give you by virtue of holding the document you thereby have to the good which is of course huge commercially .,technology
but that explains why those document had to be in physical form before because they had to be possessed and held and transferred .,technology
to be able to wave it around at that point .,technology
and that when i have it and give it to you i no longer have it and you have it and you have sole control of it and you have the sole copy you have the legally relevant sole copy of it .,technology
and you couldnt do that in digital form .,technology
the law wouldnt allow it .,technology
party wanted to use for obvious reason electronic bill of lading because with paper you have to get that piece of paper from maybe i am a seller in new zealand and you are the buyer and you are over here in england .,technology
youd have to wait for that physical paper document to get from one side of the planet to the other which is of course in two thousand and twenty three absolutely crazy .,technology
the electronic trade document act all six substantive section of it is about making legal equivalent between paper document and electronic document that fulfill certain criterion .,technology
thats the important thing because those electronic document have to be able to do what you and i have said .,technology
you have to have a singular copy ha to be fully transferable that when i get rid of it you do not want multiple copy around .,technology
it is the double spend problem .,technology
i do not want to give you to those good and give it to ten other people .,technology
whether you are in the music industry when people were copying music thats where were you then ?,technology
the technology is only quite recently able to do that .,technology
thats what that act doe .,technology
i am going to move on a little bit because i am interested in that but i am aware that we have many question to get through .,technology
but let have a quick chat about your government advice on smart contract .,technology
what were some of the work that you did there ?,technology
smart contract were obviously when we started this project in two thousand and twenty they were fairly nascent and in fact a lot of contract lawyer did not to think about them at all .,technology
but i think now that they are quite mainstream .,technology
and when we started that project we did it with a view to maybe reforming the law of contract that it could deal with smart contract .,technology
we realized that contract law wasnt a problem .,technology
the rule of contract law a they stand and a they have stood for century are absolutely fine .,technology
it is not the rule that needed to change .,technology
it is the way in which those rule are applied in electronic and digital form .,technology
for instance very for a contract you need an offer you need an acceptance thats trite law you need some other thing a . let stick to offer an acceptance .,technology
and the thing is of course you can have an offer and acceptance you are still going to need that with a smart contract .,technology
it might look a bit different because it will not be me saying to you matt do you want to buy my oat for whatever fifty pound of turnip whatever .,technology
thats your example .,technology
yeah because thats what the contract case are about .,technology
there are about oat on the sea .,technology
but for smart contract it would be software id programmed for instance interacting with software you had programmed .,technology
but i would have programmed it to make an offer and you would have programmed it to accept on certain term .,technology
the rule and the legal shape of that agreement is exactly the same .,technology
it wa then we realized it wa about educating lawyer to apply the old rule to the new system .,technology
it wa almost about putting the old rule onto a new mechanism that wa digitized .,technology
yeah absolutely .,technology
and now let turn to where our path cross broadly ?,technology
which is the treatment of digital asset ?,technology
i do sesticola that wasnt me .,technology
i thought it wa you .,technology
your name wa on it .,technology
i wa an observer on it but i can not claim credit .,technology
a lot of the work wa done before i wa on board but you are i am now on uk dc and i did do comment on that .,technology
when i wa googling it i swear it said something i saw your name on it somewhere .,technology
i did contribute but i can not claim that that wa my work a i am saying .,technology
we had the legal statement and we had the legal statement on crypto asset and smart contract which concluded that they should be in theory no bar to crypto asset being property at law .,technology
and for smart contract to be legally binding all the way back in two thousand and nineteen to which you were i think i put here specialist consulting .,technology
can you tell u broadly what property is and why digital asset did not fit into any of those ?,technology
and i have i should have warned you before the podcast .,technology
i put some definition on if thats helpful to refer to .,technology
why is property an issue in term of digital asset ?,technology
it is ... the electronic trade document that ive talked about a subset of this and we would have done them all together if resource had led .,technology
the problem with digital asset is that for a very very long time english law and to some extent i should say still doe .,technology
it divided personal property .,technology
personal property is everything that is not your land or thing building and land .,technology
divided that into two category known a thing in action and thing in possession .,technology
and those category were regarded a completely exhausted that if you did not get a thing in one of those two category it couldnt be the subject of or the object i should say of property right .,technology
can we put an example in ?,technology
if it wa something tangible rather than thats possession or chose a a a contractual to do something ?,technology
if there are example of those two .,technology
thats important distinction .,technology
thing in possession or yeah historically show in possession are everything that you would imagine .,technology
your watch or your laptop or if you look at the historical case bag of gold thing that you can touch .,technology
and again to go back to the thing we said about document thing that i can hold i can pas on to you .,technology
it is very obviously a transfer .,technology
and thats thing in possession .,technology
thats fine .,technology
now thing in action are complete intangible .,technology
thing the obvious one is a debt .,technology
everybody know what a debt is i think .,technology
and the point about those pure intangible is that they do not have this existence in the world a piece of paper or a watch .,technology
all that they are are creature of the legal system .,technology
they only exist in far a youve got people who claim them and a legal system that recognizes them .,technology
they are hugely important but there is a massive difference between those and thing in possession .,technology
historically the law said it is one or the other .,technology
and then of course digital asset come along and they are i think they are much closer to thing in possession because i can have say an nft to be generic and quite futureproof ?,technology
some nonfungible token whatever it amount to that ha an existence in the world .,technology
it is not a debt because if you or i did not claim it nobody claimed it and a legal system chose not to recognize it it would still be there .,technology
it exists outside of the legal system .,technology
it exists objectively .,technology
but you would think yeah thing in possession which i think personally i think that would do .,technology
but i can understand why there wa difficulty with people accepting that it wa a perfect thing in possession because for instance some of them are transferred in different way .,technology
if i give you my watch what leaf my hand is exactly what arrives in your hand .,technology
and of course with some digital asset thats not the case .,technology
they might be extinguished and transferred and recreated in say your wallet .,technology
there are lot of reason why they are not quite thing in possession but they are definitely not thing in action i do not think .,technology
that wa the law commission report because they have this subjective existence that youve pointed out .,technology
that wa the problem .,technology
but people are investing all this money in digital asset .,technology
and the question a i said to some extent is still open .,technology
is there property in that going to be protected ?,technology
and that ha not been clear at all .,technology
that wa the focus of my work on digital asset .,technology
and what doe declaring something property give an individual ?,technology
if you have a property it mean that you have it is protected against the world that if somebody take it away from you interferes with your possession this is why it matter what the nature of it then you have legal remedy .,technology
ive heard people say you can get your thing back .,technology
the peculiarity of english law is you do not necessarily need that but you could get you might get the thing back .,technology
but it is a judicial discretion but you would certainly have your protected in another way .,technology
say youd get damage that amount to the market value of that thing .,technology
but it is about protecting it against third party interference .,technology
and without property you do not have that .,technology
yeah i think it is about having a almost a title to something but it also give confidence in that asset to a wider market ?,technology
because if something is declared a property or treated a property then there is a sense that a market will treat it differently because there is an ownership status .,technology
thats how i saw it .,technology
and very importantly in situation of insolvency nobody like to think about this because they do not imagine they are going to be insolvent .,technology
whereas if all i have is a contractual do not have a property ive given it to you and we have a contract you are looking after it .,technology
ill be an unsecured creditor which mean i rank far lower when the asset are being distributed .,technology
and thats bad news .,technology
a property give you a strong claim a much stronger claim than you might otherwise have .,technology
now end quote and that wa two thousand and nineteen and when i think about where we are now i would question the decentralization part mainly because i do not feel there always a need to be decentralized .,technology
you have crypto asset tether and usdc where there is clearly a centralized entity behind it .,technology
i appreciate this wa in two thousand and nineteen but do you agree with my observation ?,technology
do you have any observation on any of those five point ?,technology
is that still correct or do you think weve moved on ?,technology
no i think weve moved on .,technology
what we the difference between the ukjt and the law commission is that the ukjt is there to state .,technology
a the name suggests it wa a statement of the law whereas of course the law commission ha grace power and that it change the law .,technology
that they are doing slightly different thing .,technology
and what we realized that the law commission is that we i think for digital asset to identify that subset that can then be the object of property right you need to be a bit finer grained and you need to be a bit more discerning .,technology
what we did is we went to what we thought were the the purest rawrst principle of a digital asset .,technology
and it doe overlap with what youve read from the ukjt statement .,technology
but a i said it is it is it is not narrower and we have moved on .,technology
and what we said wa independence which is of course what weve talked about already several time because thats super important .,technology
something ha an objective existence in the world .,technology
and then a word which i am not wild about .,technology
but we could never think of a better one .,technology
and we asked load of consultees and neither could they which is rivalrousness which is simply that if i am if i if i have something if i am enjoying something a a piece of property that you can not do at the same time get it .,technology
it is exclusive use of it .,technology
i am going to come on to all of it .,technology
all . . thats .,technology
yeah i think weve moved on to those two thing .,technology
yeah i think thats broadly .,technology
looking at it wa it wa quite nice reading those those criterion .,technology
but it seems weve moved on .,technology
now through a crypto monday event organized by brian mundo i met dr. keir finlowbates who in turn spoke very knowledgeably about the fundamental of blockchain .,technology
one thing he hadnt realized wa the issue around crypto asset being property a weve discussed .,technology
and i explained to him the issue around defining property at law thing that are tangible and right that are not thing that you have a contract to write to .,technology
and that pre two thousand and nineteen ha hadnt been considered .,technology
he thought it wa a bit weird .,technology
i talked him through the task force paper with the disgust and walked him through the case of any person unknown which i wa a part of .,technology
and in that case an insurer sort a proprietary injunction over bitcoin a a ransom paid .,technology
and the court had to grapple with could crypto asset fall under a proprietary injunction on the base that is it property .,technology
it wa the first time crypto asset at law had been regarded a property in common law .,technology
and it wa a huge effort from the barrister at the time and the wider team .,technology
but yeah darrell connell did a great job .,technology
and in your view then why hadnt this issue around crypto asset being property been considered pre two thousand and nineteen when bitcoin let say wa wa broadly released a decade before ?,technology
i think there a couple of thing .,technology
i think the simplest explanation is that bitcoin wa obviously bitcoin obviously get a a bad press i think generally and people roll their eye and it is seen a a very unfair is thing .,technology
but and it can be of course but then can cash .,technology
come the internet .,technology
but what it ha done is it ha spawned much else .,technology
and it is in term of distributed ledger technology in term of getting around the double spam program in digital form .,technology
thats all great .,technology
but of course what it what it did come from wa wa an anarchic source .,technology
and the the original ethos to it wa we do not need we can do this without intermediary .,technology
we do not need court .,technology
we do not need legal advisor code is law all that stuff .,technology
i think that probably for a while .,technology
and of course thats i am not saying this a a lawyer i am saying this a a human stating fact of course that is fine a long a party are happy for it to be resolved in that way .,technology
but of course a is inevitable all of these thing once they spread into the mainstream it is difficult to think of it not being mainstream now but it wasnt then .,technology
and i think it wa the the the availability heuristic of litigation if you that it took that long for a dispute that party wanted intervention with to get to get to court .,technology
i think it is that boring an explanation .,technology
i guess it took ten year from it release to being widely adopted to being worth litigating over .,technology
it is a short period of time .,technology
it is increasing is not it ?,technology
when we started this project in two thousand and twenty these project i should say a lot of what we were talking about felt very speculative .,technology
people did not know a lot of people did not know especially lawyer did not know what it wa we were talking about .,technology
he fast forward even two and a half year .,technology
most of our audience had an idea what we were talking about .,technology
and a there ha now been a suite of common law decision after a that wa that wa what i suppose you could say started or but there been load of judicial decision making now .,technology
it doe feel a bit a snowball effect which is no bad thing in term of sorting out what the right are .,technology
yeah it is been great .,technology
i think our jurisdiction ha been leading the way with this stuff .,technology
to turn paragraph fifty nine of that judgment a person unknown the judge note with reference to the statement on crypto asset and smart contract .,technology
and i quote the conclusion wa expressed .,technology
the conclusion wa expressed wa that a crypto asset might not be a thing in action on a narrow definition of that term .,technology
but that doe not mean that it can not be treated a property .,technology
essentially and for the reason identified in that legal statement i consider that a crypto asset such a bitcoin are property end quote .,technology
at this moment crypto asset were property albeit at common law .,technology
i suppose the law commission saw this and thought we need to do some future proofing and consider it broadly .,technology
wa that the the modus operandi for the law commission ?,technology
i think we wanted to bring some clarity to the law because of course that the problem with common law development which we talked about which is great in the sense that it is very responsive .,technology
and it is a lot more agile obviously than statute or whats the person in statute take year and year to change it if indeed you can .,technology
but of course the downside to leaving it to develop through common law through case law is again you have to wait for the case to come up .,technology
and of course what you then have a most of the time and i think this ha played out and it is fairly true for all the case we have had is the question get asked in small part .,technology
of course in a a it wa about could it be the subject of an injunction ?,technology
and then you have can it be do you have a fiduciary duty in relation to all these all these question separate legal question .,technology
whereas we spoke to judge and we spoke to to legal advisor .,technology
and we got the impression that what would be helpful is is a bringing together of all of those question and all of those issue into one document that we could deal with them all a a coherent whole .,technology
and i can not quite remember the time frame now .,technology
i think that wed already decided that before aa wa wa handed down .,technology
but the aim wa very much to bring all of those issue together and to decide them a a a a coherent whole which of course is something that judge can not do because they have to deal with the question .,technology
let move through through this chronologically then there wa the law commission digital asset call to evidence .,technology
can you tell u i suppose you your view already answered my first question .,technology
why wa that set up ?,technology
but secondly who responded ?,technology
and what wa some of your favorite or least favorite feedback ?,technology
who responded broad a i said and that and thats great .,technology
thats what we wanted .,technology
we listen technically absolutely anybody can respond .,technology
and their name appears i think in the back of it .,technology
yeah yeah everybody .,technology
yeah it is great .,technology
it tended to be with digital asset it tended to be either end user or technology of some form whether they were platform developer service provider their legal counsel and academic who were interested judge think that probably cover the most of the broad basis .,technology
those were all the bit we got a huge amount of input from legal counsel .,technology
and which wa brilliant because we kept being told you are you are you are you are looking for a problem .,technology
is that what they said ?,technology
ive heard a lot of people load of people told u that .,technology
and then before this people would say to me you are doing this project and it is only because it is hyped and wa a hope for a reason ?,technology
but even when you go on linkedin anybody that touch any of this is always excited about it and promoting it .,technology
yeah and there were real client with real problem arising from this .,technology
what wa some call for evidence ?,technology
that i think that answer the question about what wa my favorite it wa the the strong yes we are glad you are doing this because these are question that we have been asked for a while now .,technology
and of course it is hard to give legal advice when youve got no frame of reference .,technology
and you have very little litigation and there the statute need interpreting and it is not at all clear .,technology
i could i could understand why legal advisor felt they needed this .,technology
that that i think wa my favorite part of the initial response which wa we are not doing something thats science fiction and space age and i have had all these thing quoted at me .,technology
and thats and thats my least favorite thing wa still a few people saying needle criticism .,technology
yeah this is the law commission wasting time when there are other area of law that need reform there always area of law that need reform but yeah that wa my least favorite. . and it is still going .,technology
it seems surprising that therell be such a pushback to say that this is a waste of time .,technology
but anyway i do that wa proved wrong .,technology
you were proved .,technology
and next in the chronology wa the digital asset consultation paper published 28th of july two thousand and twenty two which included the law commissioner thought on our thought following the assimilation of opinion provided under the call for evidence .,technology
and three is rivalrous and quote to use your favorite word .,technology
and now the first of these three limb seems to my mind relatively straightforward .,technology
but there were a few point that i thought wa worth flushing out the podcast .,technology
there is a statement within when i read it which wa an excellent footnote which read a follows and i quote wa we consider that all tangible thing have been have an informational attribute to them .,technology
we do not consider them to be composed of data represented in an electronic medium in any normal sense .,technology
end quote the footnote read this would come close to a fantasy or matrix s environment where all thing were simply treated a being composed of information .,technology
see the matrix one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine end quote .,technology
why wa this something that wa included ?,technology
did you feel they are extreme pedant at play ?,technology
i know you have to go to the extreme to figure out what the boundary are .,technology
but i laughed when i read this .,technology
is that how far you needed to go ?,technology
this is an argument that weve had .,technology
weve heard i heard for year when i wa writing about this stuff academically and ha persisted albeit generally from from from one source and from one support .,technology
one source not not one individual but it is it is quite a strong academic argument ?,technology
everything is data .,technology
thats all we are talking about when we talk about digital asset is information .,technology
and for anyone who listening to this to whom it is not clear there is and it is and it is absolutely correct that there is a legal rule that you can not have a property in pure information .,technology
and there a famous case somebody stole an exam paper back in the day when they were all in paper and and copied down the question or you do not remember the question .,technology
i can not remember the exact fact but got the question ?,technology
then put the paper back .,technology
and there wa a big question about had he stolen that that information .,technology
and it wa no you can not steal information because it is purely intangible .,technology
you can not carry it away .,technology
obviously if ive got information in my brain i tell you this information but it doesnt remove it from my brain .,technology
that there no independence of the sort that weve talked about .,technology
there wa a common objection to what we were trying to do with digital asset which wa that information and you can not have property and information which a i said i think is .,technology
we have been at pain to point out why they are far more than information because they are information instantiated in this independent .,technology
i think it is physical but i do not think it matter whether you think it is physical or not .,technology
it is this independent form in the world .,technology
i memorize the serial number on all the note in your wallet .,technology
and obviously i then do not get the transactional spending power of those note simply by knowing the serial .,technology
i need that note and i need to pas that note over .,technology
it ha to be instantiated in that form .,technology
and exactly the same is true of say a bitcoin ill use a bitcoin because it is the thing that most people have heard of .,technology
if you take a virtual currency that is in essence if you put it in human readable form it is a string of alphanumeric code ?,technology
again i could memorize or write down or whatever .,technology
the alphanumeric code belong all the alphanumeric code belong into some crypto whale .,technology
but i still wouldnt be rich .,technology
i wouldnt be any richer than i wa before i did that because knowing that pure information is not the same a having the digital asset .,technology
it is not information it is information instantiated within a system .,technology
then you can not have proprietary right over property ?,technology
over information .,technology
over information .,technology
sorry i completely screwed that question up .,technology
what i meant to say wa you can not have proprietary right over data slash information .,technology
if it is pure information .,technology
if i tell you an idea then you are going to do it .,technology
and again then all of a sudden you have database right copyright .,technology
you have intellectual property which is a completely different thing .,technology
but the whole reason why the law ha intellectual property is that you can not have normal property right in pure information or in a design or in an idea .,technology
the law created this whole new statutory intellectual property right which gave you the ability to an extent to protect your idea .,technology
but that doesnt exist normally at law which is exactly why statute had to emerge to protect it .,technology
and a lot of people again in the early day said to me and to some extent still do but why can not you do it through intellectual property ?,technology
but the two thing are very different .,technology
and when you buy again ill use an nft for the sake of being generic .,technology
when you buy an nft you do not necessarily you can but you do not necessarily want it .,technology
because you want you do not want the intellectual property right you do not want to have it a your your thing commercially to exploit .,technology
you want it because you want the border .,technology
i know i am standing this is outdated now is not it ?,technology
but you want the the artwork or whatever it represents you want the thing you want the use value .,technology
and and the thing is when we buy tangible thing book and back in the day if you bought a dvd you knew you werent buying the intellectual property and you did not want the intellectual property .,technology
and for some reason when it come to digital form people merge the two and they can not see that yes you can have intellectual property and digital asset .,technology
but you can also have the use value which is what you want .,technology
and this to the and again we could talk about that for a long time but that doe ask the matrix question what do you think about that ?,technology
but certainly a to the second limb about the data object existing outside of the legal system existing independently from person or the legal system .,technology
can you explain that thinking on why thats vital ?,technology
yeah it go back to that piece of paper thing we said at the start it is about partly about the double spend problem .,technology
it is about recognizing that now technology can emulate in digital form what weve always taken for granted in term of possessibility .,technology
yes we all use those .,technology
but the beauty of a word document is that it is not singular .,technology
and you want to be able to present it .,technology
yeah you want to be able to share it .,technology
but when it is a bitcoin you do not you want that to be yours or a fraction of a bitcoin whatever .,technology
thing that shouldnt fall into the category .,technology
yeah those in disha i think we called them in that paper .,technology
they are characteristic .,technology
anyway those characteristic .,technology
they are criterion i think .,technology
those criterion were our attempt to identify and crystallize what it is about conventional tangible asset that make them the proper objective property right and how they therefore differ from the thing we talked about earlier in tangible right debt .,technology
we were trying to isolate the physical characteristic that separated those two thing .,technology
and the last point on that criterion that ive had before wa this whole idea about rivalrousness .,technology
the example given at paragraph five spot four eight wa and i quote wa mackinbury in charge of this part .,technology
and i quote this mean the thing in question must be something whose capacity for use is not limited .,technology
people must therefore complete must compete with one one another for it .,technology
more formally a resource is rivalrous if use of the resource by another person necessitate necessarily it is not easy to say this prejudice the ability of others to make equivalent use of the same thing .,technology
this is why i think this wa mapped for sure .,technology
for example if alice us a game boy to play her pokemon red game bob can not use the same game boy at the same time .,technology
alices use of the game boy prejudice bob ability to use it .,technology
my question here wa why wa this provision included ?,technology
and i think the answer is youve already come up with is that you want an exclusivity to these these piece of property ?,technology
thats the point .,technology
you can not have it is almost an mp3 back in the day where people copy paste and all of a sudden everybodys got a copy of this song ?,technology
it ha to be a level of rivalrousness .,technology
i guess there nothing more to add on that point .,technology
no i do not think .,technology
it is about if it is if if if something is not rivalrous you probably do not most of the time need a want it protected anyway .,technology
yeah yeah i suppose .,technology
all of these proposition relate to digital asset which includes digital file and record email account and in game asset i think wa also included in this paper .,technology
the main name and of course crypto token .,technology
doe this mean then that prior to this paper or prior to at least some good thought on this topic that an mp3 file wasnt property ?,technology
yeah probably .,technology
what we were very clear about .,technology
this wa where we had some of the most interesting disagreement i think .,technology
we had a few round table where we discussed pretty much the list that youve read out there .,technology
what we decided would be the best way to proceed .,technology
and again this link to what ive said about not wanting to make intangible in general that the objective of these property right is we did not want to isolate specific category and say all mp3s or all digital file or all database will or will not be .,technology
because again we do not know how those thing are going to develop in the near future .,technology
and we did not want to prejudge i suppose what they would look .,technology
the short answer to your question is i think yes .,technology
and the way we wanted to get around that wa to produce these characteristic that people would at least have a frame of reference in the future to hold their thing up against and decide whether or not they would have property right in it .,technology
and obviously you are most likely to do that through a legal advisor but the point remains .,technology
and also it depends a lot on context because of course there is i am saying of course because ive encountered it much maybe listener will not be quite familiar with it but ive certainly encountered a lot of homogenization of digital asset .,technology
a loss of it is about function and context .,technology
and you can have nfts that are rivalrous and independent there might be another situation where they are designed not to be .,technology
what we said wa we are not going to refer to these separate category of thing we are going to stick to characteristic .,technology
and a long a something exhibit those characteristic it doesnt matter what it is called it doesnt matter what category it go in it can be the object of property right .,technology
and then this move u to the next paper .,technology
after that there wa the law commission digital asset final report 28th of june two thousand and twenty three .,technology
i hope ive got that .,technology
yeah yeah it is been a long time .,technology
it wa thirty year .,technology
which broadly follows the proposal laid out in it predecessor except those three criterion became indicia .,technology
thats thats true .,technology
however one limb which read and that wa the first one composed of data you got rid of the composed of data there .,technology
ill read out the quote to make it easy is composed of data represented in electronic medium including in the form of computer code electronic digital or analog signal .,technology
why did you get rid of the composed of data bit ?,technology
that wa the result of consultation .,technology
this is a nice example of how law commission consultation are genuine consultation .,technology
we we quite often change change our mind .,technology
when we speak to all the all the people ive mentioned before in user and legal advisor on .,technology
there were two reason for that .,technology
i never liked it anyway i have to say personally i never thought that we needed to restrict it to data object because i thought that the independence and rival rest with it with a real key to identifying those thing that need these proprietary protection .,technology
i am talking factually not legally .,technology
factually i can take your car i can take your watch i can take your thing away from you if you do not even if you do not want me to .,technology
can not do that with a debt .,technology
i can not i can not take your right away from you .,technology
i can infringe them but i do not remove them from you .,technology
you still get them you still get to keep them .,technology
digital asset the sort of digital asset that can be the object of property right need to be those that can be involuntarily alienated which is why they arrive or u why we care that we want them back .,technology
and i thought that independence and rivalryness were the only thing we needed to make that identification .,technology
and then when we were speaking in consultation with various group for instance they brought the same thing to our attention .,technology
for instance there were people who talked to u about voluntary carbon credit .,technology
i saw that and thought that wa a bit of a left field thing to include but i wouldnt have thought about it .,technology
it is a good thing to include .,technology
yeah good thing to include and potentially massive and obviously growing .,technology
these are credit by which you can offset your carbon contribution .,technology
they are obviously very valuable .,technology
they are tradable .,technology
i think they are the thing that sits closest to the border of our criterion .,technology
but we saw no reason particularly once we were presented with the argument from those who thought that vcc should be the object of property right .,technology
and there are case there is at least one case where they are involuntarily alienated .,technology
i can not think of a snappy way to say it .,technology
you are doing a better job than me where it is taking these hard word .,technology
yeah we got rid of the first limb .,technology
and i personally think it is much better than that .,technology
one point that run through this paper is the recommendation to let common law develop the jurisprudence in the area .,technology
not to legislate but allow the court to figure this out a and when those question arise .,technology
surely this approach put extra pressure on judge .,technology
it mean the only way these issue are determined is where number one there is a dispute between party and two where there are people who are wealthy enough to pay lawyer to figure it out which is on the most part rare .,technology
ive had personal experience that have been interesting .,technology
but people do not want to spend money finding out whats academically interesting .,technology
they want their right they want their property whatever it may be .,technology
i appreciate that we are now a we sit here today at a legislative level .,technology
but given that this wa last year and that the general sense of thing wa that it should be common law led how do you marry this up with the resulting proposition ?,technology
the resulting proposition you mean the bill ?,technology
this is this is another interesting insight into law commission process .,technology
for the reason that weve already talked about in this podcast we thought common law wa far better suited because it can be more responsive .,technology
you can future proof the whole thing because a soon a you start saying in statutory form what is a digital asset ?,technology
is that a date before youve started ? ?,technology
yeah yeah exactly .,technology
and we thought a thats incredibly difficult .,technology
some jurisdiction in the world have tried it .,technology
and those the resulting statute have run to thousand and thousand of provision .,technology
and of course once you start doing that there are more hostage to fortune .,technology
a lot of people usually non lawyer think that a statute equal le uncertainty .,technology
of course one to a lawyer .,technology
and thats not strictly true .,technology
the the court still have to interpret them .,technology
we thought common law is the best way to do it .,technology
and common law ha dealt with property for century that what we wanted to do wa sneak digital asset probably shouldnt say sneak because that make u out of the hand .,technology
we thought we should key digital asset into the development of the common law and let the common law do it magic .,technology
but the whole point of our final report that you referred to wa that we wanted to be able to because it is absolutely a bit of a what could be seen a the page passing the book to judge .,technology
and it is a big job for them .,technology
what we said is well do this final report that will provide the analytical framework that judge can refer to you .,technology
and thankfully it ha been used in that way .,technology
but the interesting thing wa we had this round table with judge a we do with all of these thing .,technology
and obviously we clearly wanted to bring to their attention the fact that we were about to go there you are because all over joy you go go and read this .,technology
and they said we did suggest it but we did not think theyd go for it .,technology
and they said thats all they need to open it up .,technology
because this is a very big legal step to go from those two category that have been there for century .,technology
and they said theyd find it helpful .,technology
weve got that little bill which wa introduced to parliament two week ago because the judge asked for it .,technology
they were quite happy to develop the common law alongside our guideline .,technology
and i should make it clear they are absolutely guideline .,technology
we are of course not telling the judiciary what to do we couldnt do that .,technology
but they needed that little bit of the door kicked open slightly that they could then make law .,technology
yeah it wa always permission .,technology
and thats it i guess it is that open door to give them the ability to go and create law in the way that you anticipate .,technology
the latest report and i suppose the final report published twenty two july two thousand and twenty four and wa a supplemental report and a draft bill for parliament a weve spoken about .,technology
a short note i put in my note here then in the previous paper the three criterion then became indicia i can not say it indicia indicia i do not think ive ever had to say it loud before indicia .,technology
it did not mean that each of them had to be followed by the stringoleta do it wa something that wa proposed .,technology
and i understand that there some future proofing here ive used that term throughout this recording with you .,technology
and it is not to limit the definition of thing which exist now but to a i say future proof thing going forward .,technology
is there anything that is on the horizon already that youve seen that youve thought i am glad we left this negative definition open or are we still in a period whereby we are waiting for these new digital asset to exist ?,technology
i think there there no discrete category that that i can think of at the moment maybe thats not surprising given that we are le than a year down the road .,technology
but what i would say is there are two thing vccs that weve already mentioned they are voluntary carbon credit they are evolving their form is evolving .,technology
and what ive seen even since the report not the supplemental on the one before that is the massive increase in real world asset tokenization and uptake from major bank most of them .,technology
this is the trendy thing this year is not it ?,technology
it is tokenization of real world asset .,technology
yeah absolutely .,technology
whats next year ?,technology
yeah exactly that .,technology
although we did have those thing in mind when we wrote those recommendation we did not know quite how big they were going to get and how quickly and of course the bigger they get and the more adopted they are the more refined the technology will get .,technology
in fact the draft bill is called the property digital asset etc bill etc .,technology
i thought it wa quite interesting but let not talk about that .,technology
slated for parliament on the 11th of september two thousand and twenty four the word digital and electronic are included only a a reference and i think youve gone through the reason why .,technology
the wording of the bill read and i quote a thing including a thing that is digital or electronic in nature is not prevented from being the object of personal property right merely because it is neither a thing in possession or a thing in choice .,technology
the subject of the bill however is a thing .,technology
is that the word ?,technology
seems a bit obscure a thing .,technology
yes deliberately .,technology
when youve heard me say several time today i am trying to be generic and throughout these project ive tried to be a generic a possible .,technology
personally i am not what i did not get i did not .,technology
you do not have to take credit for the word thing .,technology
no i do not want to take credit for the word thing but youve already drawn attention to the fact that it is called the digital asset etc bill and the first line that say a thing including a digital thing .,technology
i do not think those part were necessary .,technology
the parenthesis the bear word say including a thing that is digital .,technology
if it had been up to me and obviously it wasnt it wa a joint effort and a consultative effort but if it had been up to me i do not think we need digital i do not think you need to put that in .,technology
most of the time it will be digital but it is not it is not unnecessary but thing i think is very important .,technology
is that a word ?,technology
it is now .,technology
i certainly can not take credit for that .,technology
there a lot of property literature on that and there a guy called henry smith who writes about thingness and thingness is what weve tried to do there with independence and rivalryness .,technology
it is to crystallize and identify what it is about stuff that make it the appropriate object of property right .,technology
the thing weve talked about full divestibility on transfer being able to hold it and when i say hold it i do not necessarily mean with my hand because of course i hold thing in my wallet by other mean .,technology
control control is key to the final report certainly .,technology
once i can control something it is likely to be seen and i hope it will be seen by the law a a thing and i can only control thing .,technology
yes deliberately generic because i think all that is necessary are those characteristic and whatever in the future might fall within those characteristic .,technology
there no obvious reason to me and i am going to leave it in the negative way .,technology
there no obvious reason to me why it shouldnt be an object of property right but that negative thing wa suggested to u by the judge the negative phrasing it is a challenge .,technology
but i think thats important because what we are saying is again we are not telling the court or parliament i should say .,technology
parliament will not be telling the court you must say these thing are object of property right .,technology
what they are saying is there no reason not to .,technology
if the fact are and you feel in this case it is that aa if you feel that there no reason why it shouldnt have a proprietary injunction then feel free to do it .,technology
but there no mandate there no every time a digital asset fulfills these condition or exhibit these characteristic .,technology
this whole negative definition thing is to give judge comfort that they can make decision without looking silly .,technology
thats exactly it .,technology
silly the word .,technology
without looking unconstitutional i think thats exactly it .,technology
and i suppose it is due to be considered by parliament .,technology
do we know when that is ?,technology
it is been introduced now .,technology
itll be ... probably due to the normally tank .,technology
and if the answer is we do not know we do not know .,technology
it is how long is a piece of string .,technology
it is affected by how long a bill take is affected by all sort of thing .,technology
the electronic trade document act .,technology
yeah my baby wa affected by the death of monarch because parliament dissolve .,technology
we had four law chancellor we had three prime minister we had a couple of general election and every time you have something that parliament dissolve .,technology
you lose the ... you can not even predict on the basis of this .,technology
it is not usually about the substance of the bill or certainly not in the case of these because they are not too controversial .,technology
the short answer is very much we do not know .,technology
i suppose we could say based on current political relative stability it might be quicker than it would have been for ... or it wa for the eetda .,technology
i would be hopeful that it would be within six month but i am ... you are small bit a . i think i read it all out on this .,technology
it is tiny ?,technology
you go ... but it is about getting the time in parliament and ... it is the timetabling is not it ?,technology
yeah it is the timetabling .,technology
i hope it come soon because it itll give confidence even more confidence to the market which is an important thing .,technology
id to talk about your new role a the head of digital asset and trade finance at d2 legal technology because you have now moved on from the law commission .,technology
firstly who are d2 legal technology and what do they do ?,technology
it is a interesting set of consultant .,technology
and i think it is still fair to say they find that very difficult because they ... they use different language and in the case of technologist a different language .,technology
there is a real disconnect often between those two world which is not helpful .,technology
at the law commission we tried to do that .,technology
we had a few very techy lawyer who could do that .,technology
and then once wed done these law reform i felt the job wasnt finished because of course you can change the law and you can make the condition quite conducive for people to adopt new technology .,technology
but that doesnt necessarily mean theyll do it .,technology
there always an implementation difficulty .,technology
what d2lt can do is be that bridge .,technology
but either nobody know what to do with it or nobody notice it .,technology
yeah nobody notice they have to do that .,technology
thats for doing that but sitting in a drawer .,technology
and the people who understand that legal advice are not the people who understand how to implement the process .,technology
thats what we do .,technology
we fill that gap .,technology
and what doe your role entail ?,technology
and how doe your experience a a professor and with the law society help with that role ?,technology
my role at the moment is a lot of learning .,technology
i sit around listening to people thinking i must remember that .,technology
a lot of what ive said which fit in with both of my previous role because obviously a a law professor you have to teach some pretty complicated idea to at least in the first instance people who have no idea whats going on about law .,technology
and you have to do that in quite a short amount of time .,technology
and then fast forward to law commission day .,technology
and it wa even harder because what i wa doing wa trying to sell we had to sell these project to government trying to sell these quite complex lawyer project to people in government who werent lawyer and had about twenty minute .,technology
and we are interested in whats going to look shiny what the minister going to whatll look good in the paper .,technology
and when you are trying to say we want to reform the bill of exchange act one thousand eight hundred and eighty three because and you can see that the blood drain .,technology
you have to develop way of and you can usually do it through money a soon a you start talking big a this could save u two hundred and twenty four billion a year .,technology
there plenty more of a story there .,technology
you have to learn way to get your point across understanding that not everybody is the legal geek that you are .,technology
thats what i am trying to do on this podcast trying to help people understand number one digital asset and tech and law to some extent .,technology
and a question that i sometimes ask nice and broad is what is your view of the future of digital asset ?,technology
i am ive been optimistic all the way through these project ive always said to people we are not looking for problem .,technology
these digital asset are being used more and more and more .,technology
i think it is exponential .,technology
and we are going to encounter more of these issue which i see a a good thing because thats thats the way that you are now our problem .,technology
and that i think ive ive been proved .,technology
i do not mean to stress i wa the only person saying that far from it .,technology
i think we have been proved the people who said that .,technology
and i think they are going from strength to strength .,technology
definitely in the past three year i spent a lot of time on the conference circuit practitioner conference circuit .,technology
and the conversation ive heard over those three year have come on leap and bound in term of real use case a said big bank jpmorgan embracing digital asset using them an awful lot .,technology
it is not we might do this in the future .,technology
it is this .,technology
and of course every time that happens you get then more impetus for developer to make them better .,technology
exponential is why i see the development a . and i am going to ask you a question a final question that i havent included on the piece of paper .,technology
ive thought about it now while i wa listening to you .,technology
is the uk the leader in this ?,technology
or do you feel there somewhere else doing a better job at encouraging the use of digital asset ?,technology
i think we have been a leader in a lot of way .,technology
and certainly in term of private law right which is essentially what ive been talking about today .,technology
i think we are a leader .,technology
we had our law commission work cited in celsius bank cropsey case in the u because the judge there did not have any other thing to refer to .,technology
that wa quite nice that we because thats exactly what we wanted to do .,technology
we werent precious about it .,technology
we wanted to send that out .,technology
i think in term of private law development dubai ha recently done quite a lot of work but based on on what weve done a singapore is always a frontrunner .,technology
they certainly did electronic trade document before we did because they they are a bit more of a nimble equal system and parliamentary system .,technology
and regulation wise i think we are in the middle we havent been incredibly whats the word we havent been incredibly restrictive in the way that the u sec could have been said to be until quite recently a i think weve gone one side .,technology
but equally we havent rolled out the red carpet and we were never going to do that it is not a very english jurisdictional thing to do .,technology
and i think at the moment we are waiting and seeing which is not a terrible thing because i do not think there necessarily a first mover advantage .,technology
in regulation i think it is a bit more of a wait and see but i am quite pleased that i think we have been at the forefront of the other development .,technology
i think weve done a good job in this jurisdiction i think for my world private law being in the high court there been decent amount of precedence .,technology
and when i speak to certainly american lawyer they are always relying on sec type case .,technology
and it is a whole different ball game .,technology
and when i tell them the type of work that i do they seem to be semi flummox that you can do this thing in this jurisdiction .,technology
i think we have an ability to be a little bit more nimble than others .,technology
but my sense of regulation is is that we havent been particularly knee jerk but we have been maybe too patient .,technology
but i think that agrees .,technology
no i think we are being too patient .,technology
i think it is about time now that but i say that and that there are there are thing being done .,technology
it is not a if at all .,technology
no they are absolutely not sitting on their hand .,technology
no and it is better not to rush into these thing .,technology
and you do need to get the private law sorted before you can do the regulation .,technology
because of course you do not know what you regulate .,technology
you do not know what the link .,technology
i think i think it will be fired again this optimist in me .,technology
and i know that for instance the fca is definitely on it .,technology

thanks for watching .,technology
there this narrative lm replacing job replacing program and particular .,technology
especially in term of threetocan student ill say even if you want to get into ai there always a value in having good software fundamental software engineering fundamental programming fundamental understanding foundation of ai which include thing probability and statistic .,technology
i have a picture pinned to my wall image you and me laughing loving it all .,technology
but look at our life now all tired and torn .,technology
weve mustnt fight and delight in the tear that will not cry and feel done .,technology
all be now .,technology
welcome back to the free code camp podcast .,technology
i am quincy larsen teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org .,technology
each week we are bringing you insight from developer founder and ambitious people getting into tech .,technology
and this week we are talking with efon my a senior software engineer on google tensorflow team who left the private sector behind to go to ai research at stanford .,technology
efon is currently lead maintainer of the open source helm project where he benchmark the performance of large language model .,technology
efon welcome to the show .,technology
thanks much for having me quincy .,technology
it is all good to be here .,technology
yeah and i am hyped to have you here because you have the benefit of having worked in the private sector a a software engineer and now also a a researcher at stanford .,technology
you work a a doing hardcore software engineering on google tensorflow team .,technology
and now you are working doing hardcore cutting edge research with these emerging model and figuring out how good they are .,technology
and thats super super exciting to me .,technology
yeah i am glad to be talking about this stuff .,technology
yeah and ill give the audience some perspective on how you and i met .,technology
i went to this event in singapore or it wasnt in singapore but it wa it might a a i thought it wa ton of singaporean in san francisco .,technology
and of course you grew up in singapore ?,technology
yes i grew up in singapore .,technology
i moved here in the two thousand and ten .,technology
ive been in the bay of san francisco bay of f about fourteen year now .,technology
yeah and youve made good use of time .,technology
and youve been working a an international student or how did you get here ?,technology
yeah i wa originally i grew up in singapore .,technology
i did most of my schooling in singapore .,technology
and thats when i came here .,technology
and i stayed here .,technology
i stayed on after that and kept working here .,technology
and thats where .,technology
and then i did my undergrad in massachusetts at stanford .,technology
and now i working at stanford .,technology
i to joke it is a bit moving back at the parent house .,technology
yeah but it is ive been enjoying being the baby .,technology
and is it common for someone to leave ?,technology
because people leave academia all the time for the eye paying fancy job cushy job in silicon valley in new york city place that .,technology
but is it common for someone to leave that life behind ?,technology
volunteerally sit down the tool and go do something almost completely different .,technology
doing research is very different from applying tool .,technology
or maybe you are doing a lot of research while you are at google in addition to being a software engineer .,technology
but is that a common career progression ?,technology
or would you say thats relatively uncommon ?,technology
yeah good question .,technology
it is id say it is quite different because the the academia track and in particular .,technology
i friend who have transitioned in both direction .,technology
i friend who did a phd in academia and published these doing research and then coming back to engineering in industry .,technology
and i also friend that have done engineering in industry and the site i am going to go and do research and go back to academia and do a phd .,technology
and now some of my friend are facting member .,technology
a family industry in all the faculty .,technology
i think the the motivation for doing that there both academia and engineering in the industry are very different career path with very different incentive .,technology
in the u especially academia is a rigid track where i expect it to you have a very fixed career path where you are expected to do a phd and then possibly a post doc in between .,technology
and then have a junior faculty and a senior faculty .,technology
and it is a little this is different from from from from industry and for my friend whove done it the move from engineering in the academia i think a lot of the motivation is do not want to do research they wanted to advance that can feel .,technology
for me the motivation wa a little different because i i am different from from my friend in that i did not go back to academia to do the academic track .,technology
ive i do not have a phd and ive had a phd which is very unusual and yeah you do not have any intention of doing a phd .,technology
i do not which is i am the only person in my lab who not thinking about getting a phd or already ha a phd .,technology
i i saw think of myself more of an engineer because i i building thing .,technology
let a little different from what my friend motivation are because i am not going to be on faculty track ever i am not going to be a professor .,technology
and the way i am thinking about it is instead of my impact being polishing research bleeding research and thinking more of my impact is being a supporter of scientific researcher .,technology
i write software and software and i maintain infrastructure that enables other scientific researcher to do their stuff .,technology
and i think thats thats all a big motivation for me .,technology
i think i enjoyed being close to researcher at google i also had a bit of that because i work on cancer flow and there are machine learning researcher in google and i think thats a a scientific message .,technology
but i might know i feel a lot more closer to the research than advancing than my knowledge at google .,technology
thats interesting .,technology
it is almost a data engineer role where the way i think of data engineer is there team up the data for the data scientist there .,technology
they are there .,technology
you are putting them in position that they can succeed in their mission .,technology
but your skill set and the work you do is a little bit different .,technology
and of course your background is different .,technology
would that be a good one .,technology
i think i think thats exactly .,technology
thats how i think a lot about .,technology
when i once said google i wa working in particular thats building machine learning infrastructure and researcher with research a lot of research is done on tensorflow .,technology
tensorflow is machine learning framework for building model and a lot of research machine learning research is done on that .,technology
my my current job goal is my job position is called research engineer or in some other university because research software engineer .,technology
these are essentially programmer who help help researcher accomplish research either by building infrastructure being software .,technology
wow they were doing this what are they doing this through browser ?,technology
i wa afraid to look it up and it did not exist those diys or whatever metric they are using were not accurate .,technology
wow thats a difficult question .,technology
both interesting .,technology
yeah some of these a used that a the common model is not necessarily decision tree which is if thats the thing .,technology
this is a podcast from techandainews.com .,technology
for more information visit our website .,technology
hey everyone and welcome back .,technology
we are gon na be taking a deep dive today into some pretty amazing ai news .,technology
claude three.fives new ability to use computers. . now this is not ai chatting with u . it is ai getting thing done working with software .,technology
yeah it is pretty incredible .,technology
it is wild .,technology
anthropic the company behind claude three.five is changing the game here .,technology
we are moving away from ai that talk to u and now we are moving towards ai that work with us. . inside the software that we use every day .,technology
what doe that even mean ?,technology
imagine you are working on a spreadsheet ?,technology
and you need to pull some data from a website. . instead of copying and pasting it you could tell claude three.five what you need .,technology
it understands what you are asking it go to the website extract the data and boom it is in your spreadsheet .,technology
hold on that sound something straight out of a movie .,technology
is this for real ?,technology
this is happening now .,technology
and it is not spreadsheet .,technology
think about email calendar even code editor .,technology
this tooling feature this is a pretty big deal .,technology
it is a game changer .,technology
it is huge for developer .,technology
you can automate many task you could have ai help you debug in real time .,technology
it is having an assistant that not only understands you but can carry out your instruction .,technology
in all these different program .,technology
across all sort of application .,technology
this is all thanks to ... this is thanks to some big advancement in natural language processing .,technology
nlp exactly .,technology
you remember those old chat box that we used to have to use ?,technology
you practically had to speak robot to get them to do anything ?,technology
you had to be specific .,technology
it wa ridiculous .,technology
but with claude three.five it is intuitive it understands the nuance of human language .,technology
you could tell it to find me the sale report from last quarter and give me a quick summary .,technology
and itll do it .,technology
no more robotic command .,technology
thats amazing .,technology
it is fantastic .,technology
but how are they managing this ?,technology
how is anthropic ?,technology
are they over promising ?,technology
thats a great question .,technology
a lot of people are wondering that .,technology
but whats interesting about anthropic is that they are committed to experimentation and transparency. . they are constantly testing thing out gathering feedback and refining their model .,technology
they are not here the ai good luck .,technology
and theyve even come out with two new models. ?,technology
yeah each one is designed for a different type of interaction .,technology
haiku and sonnet tell me more about these .,technology
think of them a specialized tool in your ai toolbox .,technology
say you need a quick precise answer .,technology
haiku gon na be the one to go to .,technology
it is super fast .,technology
if i need a quick answer .,technology
but if you are maybe exploring a more complex topic and you need a longer more detailed answer sonnet will give you that richer more comprehensive information .,technology
they are thinking about how people are gon na use this .,technology
yeah they are .,technology
and giving them the tool .,technology
thats pretty smart .,technology
it is and it go back to that idea of them not overpromising . . they are focusing on building ai that solves real problem .,technology
and integrates into our existing workflows. . it is not about replacing human it is about enhancing what we can do .,technology
i that it is augmenting our capability .,technology
this is all very exciting .,technology
but i am curious about how this is all gon na work in practice .,technology
can you give me some specific example ?,technology
how could someone use clod three.five in their daily life ?,technology
let say you are a marketing manager. . you are drowning in email social medium update .,technology
been there. . clod three.five could analyze your inbox prioritize message even draft response for you .,technology
it could even schedule meeting based on your conversation .,technology
it is my personal assistant .,technology
thats incredible .,technology
it could handle all those timeconsuming task .,technology
freeing you up to focus on the bigger picture .,technology
that would be amazing .,technology
strategy creative work all that .,technology
what other example are there other example ?,technology
let say you are planning a trip. . clod three.five could not only book flight and hotel for you but it could also find you hidden gem based on your interest plan out your itinerary .,technology
thats next level vacation planning .,technology
i bet it could be a huge help for student too ?,technology
for research .,technology
all kind of thing .,technology
researching topic summarizing article creating presentation even getting feedback on their writing it is quite remarkable .,technology
the possibility .,technology
they are pretty vast .,technology
this is incredible .,technology
yeah it is about making the ai experience work for you .,technology
this is blowing my mind .,technology
i know it is exciting .,technology
it feel we are on the edge of something huge here .,technology
but i also wonder about the potential downside .,technology
is there a risk that ai becomes too powerful ?,technology
yeah it is a valid concern for sure .,technology
and i think it is important to acknowledge that any technology especially one a powerful a this could be misused .,technology
of course .,technology
but i think whats important to remember is that ai is ultimately a tool ? .,technology
it is all about how we choose to use it .,technology
and that determines the impact that it is going to have .,technology
and thoughtful implementation .,technology
and thats where company anthropic are they setting a good example here ?,technology
i think they are .,technology
i think they are doing a good job .,technology
they are not focused on building the most advanced ai .,technology
they are also putting a lot of thought into ethic and user safety which is important .,technology
can you give me some example of how they are doing that ?,technology
one example is their focus on transparency .,technology
they are very open about how they are developing these model .,technology
they publish research paper .,technology
they are actively engaging with the ai ethic community which is great .,technology
they are not operating in secret. . they are inviting people to look at what they are doing and provide feedback .,technology
yeah absolutely .,technology
and they are also implementing certain safeguard to prevent misuse. . for example they have strict rule about how clawd three.five can access and use your personal data .,technology
thats good to know .,technology
they are taking privacy .,technology
yeah that make me feel a little bit better about all of this .,technology
yeah i think they are trying to strike that balance between innovation and being responsible. . being innovative but also being careful .,technology
and i think thats key to building trust with user and making sure the ai benefit everyone .,technology
yeah i think this whole conversation ha made me realize how important it is to stay informed about all this stuff .,technology
it is .,technology
it is not a tech industry issue .,technology
it is affecting all of u . this is something thats going to touch everyones life .,technology
and i think it is important for u to understand you said to stay informed .,technology
what it can do .,technology
what it can not do .,technology
yes capability it limitation .,technology
yeah how it is going to impact u . exactly .,technology
we have to be aware of all those thing .,technology
it is we need a new type of literacy almost. . ai literacy .,technology
ai literacy .,technology
i love that phrase .,technology
we need to equip ourselves with the knowledge and skill to use ai .,technology
to engage with it in a meaningful way .,technology
weve covered a lot today .,technology
we have .,technology
weve talked about all these amazing thing claude can do .,technology
how it could change how we work how we live .,technology
weve talked about the responsible development and ai literacy .,technology
it is all connected .,technology
whats the one thing you want listener to take away from all of this ?,technology
i think the biggest takeaway is that we are living in a remarkable time .,technology
ai is evolving quickly .,technology
it is .,technology
it is incredible .,technology
and it is up to u to guide it development .,technology
we need to embrace what it can do but also be mindful of the risk .,technology
be aware of the potential downside .,technology
and we need to learn a much a we can .,technology
we need to get those skill that ai literacy that you are talking about .,technology
to navigate this whole new world .,technology
to navigate this new era .,technology
thats a very powerful message .,technology
it is .,technology
it is exciting but also a little scary is not it ?,technology
it is .,technology
it is both .,technology
but i think if we have open mind in we talk about these thing and we agree on some ethical principle i think we can harness the power of ai for good .,technology
that make me feel optimistic .,technology
i do not know about you .,technology
i am optimistic a . you are good .,technology
there are definitely challenge but there also much potential .,technology
it is an amazing time to be alive .,technology
it is .,technology
it is .,technology
to see all of this happening .,technology
it is a technological revolution .,technology
for our listener who want to learn more stay up to date .,technology
where should they go ?,technology
you can always find indepth coverage and analysis at techandainews.com .,technology
it is a fantastic resource for anyone who want to learn more about ai .,technology
it is been a fascinating conversation .,technology
it ha been a pleasure .,technology
yeah absolutely .,technology
yeah i know our listener appreciate your insight .,technology
thank you .,technology
it is not every day you get to talk to an ai expert someone who can explain all this complex stuff in such an understandable way .,technology
i appreciate that i always love talking about ai .,technology
and hopefully get people a little bit more curious about it all .,technology
speaking of curiosity ive got a question thats been on my mind this whole time. . if ai can already work with software this whats next ?,technology
whats the next big thing ?,technology
that is the question is not it ?,technology
it is .,technology
honestly it is hard to say for sure .,technology
thing are changing fast .,technology
what sound science fiction today could be reality tomorrow .,technology
we can not even imagine whats next .,technology
i think thats part of what make it exciting .,technology
it is exciting .,technology
but if i had to guess i think we are going to see ai become even more integrated into our physical world. . we are already starting to see it with smart home selfdriving car .,technology
but i think thats the tip of the iceberg .,technology
instead of working on our computer ai is going to be out there in the world .,technology
yeah interacting with the world around u . imagine ai that can help u get around in complex environment help u with physical task even anticipate what we need before we even know we need it .,technology
that sound amazing but also a little freaky .,technology
it is .,technology
it is a little bit of both .,technology
and thats why these conversation are important .,technology
to be aware of whats happening .,technology
we need to be thinking about these thing talking about them and making sure that ai is developed and used in a way that benefit everyone .,technology
benefit all of u . exactly .,technology
i think it is time to wrap up our deep dive into cloud three.five and it amazing new computer use capability .,technology
to our listener thanks for joining u on this journey .,technology
we hope you learned something new today .,technology
and do not forget to check out techandainews.com for more coverage of all thing ai .,technology
it is a great site yeah .,technology
until next time keep exploring keep learning .,technology

all let dive into this waspb dependency check. . it is been making some noise in the software world .,technology
youve been looking into this ?,technology
we are hoping you can help u all pull out some of the best insights. . to help everybody ramp up their security .,technology
ive heard it described a a security guard for your code .,technology
thats a great analogy yeah .,technology
always on the lookout. . for any known vulnerability .,technology
yeah it is all about proactively identifying those weakness that could leave your software vulnerable .,technology
yeah you said it is meticulously comparing your code against a massive database of known troublemaker .,technology
it is having a security checklist thats constantly being updated .,technology
with all the latest threat .,technology
and it is checking checking checking .,technology
and whats exciting is that dependency check ha gotten even more powerful lately. ?,technology
yeah theyve supercharged the scanning engine .,technology
it is faster added support for even more programming language .,technology
and made it work seamlessly with other tool .,technology
thats impressive .,technology
but let get down to how good is it at catching vulnerability ?,technology
we all know software security is a constant game of cat and mouse .,technology
you are absolutely . . and when it come to known vulnerabilities. . those with a cveid a digital fingerprint for security flaw ?,technology
dependency check is a rock star .,technology
it is incredibly effective at spotting these common threat .,technology
it can handle the usual suspect in the software world .,technology
it can .,technology
what about those sneaky zero day vulnerability ?,technology
the one that pop up and documented them .,technology
can dependency check handle those too ?,technology
thats where thing get a bit trickier. . because dependency check relies on those database of known vulnerabilities. . it might miss zero day threats. . think of it a security guard with a slightly outdated list of wanted criminal .,technology
some new face might slip through .,technology
that make sense .,technology
it is not a foolproof solution on it own .,technology
yeah exactly .,technology
we can not rely on dependency check and call it a day .,technology
a multilayered security approach is key .,technology
imagine dependency check a your first line of defense. . it is catching those common vulnerability early on. . but you also need thing thorough code reviews. . penetration testing where ethical hacker try to break into your system .,technology
and constant vigilance for new threat to truly lock down your software .,technology
you mentioned penetration testing .,technology
can you give u a quick breakdown of how that work ?,technology
why it is important alongside dependency check ?,technology
penetration testing simulates real world attack to find vulnerability that automated tool might miss .,technology
imagine a team of skilled security expert trying every trick in the book to break into your system .,technology
they are the good guy but they are playing the bad guy .,technology
yeah exactly .,technology
by doing this you can uncover weakness that you did not even know existed .,technology
it is a stress test for your security .,technology
and you can see the limit to see where the crack are .,technology
that sound incredibly valuable .,technology
now how doe this all play out in the world of open source software ? .,technology
a lot of project rely heavily on open source library .,technology
they do .,technology
and which can be a wild card when it come to security. . you do not always know .,technology
it is true .,technology
whats going on in there ?,technology
thats where dependency check shine for a lot of developers. . because open source project are publicly accessible .,technology
it can be prime target for attacker .,technology
it is critical to be extra vigilant about the security of the library you are using .,technology
dependency check help by scanning those libraries. . and flagging any known vulnerability .,technology
giving developer a chance to address potential issue before they snowball into bigger problem .,technology
before they become a real headache .,technology
that could be expensive to fix later .,technology
yeah absolutely .,technology
it is having a dedicated security team constantly monitoring the heartbeat of your open source component .,technology
yeah thats a great way to put it .,technology
but let be realistic. . keeping all our software dependency up to date can feel a never ending game of whackamole .,technology
it definitely can .,technology
but here where dependency check becomes your secret weapon. . it help you stay ahead of the curve. . by identifying outdated library that could be harboring vulnerability .,technology
it is not about reacting to threat .,technology
it is about proactively maintaining a healthy and secure code base .,technology
it is a shift from reactive to proactive .,technology
and dependency check give you the visibility you need to make that happen .,technology
that brings to mind a important point .,technology
weve talked a lot about the technical side of dependency check .,technology
but what about the human element ? .,technology
how do we ensure that developer are using this tool effectively ?,technology
you hit the nail in the head .,technology
technology is only a good a the people using it .,technology
it is about creating a culture of security within development team .,technology
that mean providing the training and resource that developer need to understand security best practice .,technology
including how to use tool dependency check effectively .,technology
it is not about having the tool .,technology
it is about empowering developer to use them responsibly .,technology
it is about making security everyones responsibility .,technology
not something that the security team handle in isolation .,technology
when developer are empowered to contribute to the security of their code thats when real progress .,technology
this reminds me of the equifax data breach back in two thousand and seventeen .,technology
it wa a massive wake up call .,technology
about the importance of software update .,technology
that wa a stark reminder of what can happen when outdated software dependency slip through the crack .,technology
in that case the vulnerability wa in a widely used open source component called apache strut .,technology
and the fix had been available for month before the breach occurred .,technology
it is mind boggling to think that something that could happen .,technology
if they had been using dependency check it might have flagged the issue .,technology
and saved them from a world of pain .,technology
it highlight how crucial regular scan and prompt patching are .,technology
dependency check can be a lifesaver in those situation .,technology
this all circle back to our earlier point about layered security .,technology
penetration check is a fantastic tool. . but it is one piece of the puzzle .,technology
you need a comprehensive approach that includes manual code review penetration testing ongoing security awareness training and a culture that prioritizes security at every step of the development process .,technology
it is about being proactive informed and fostering a security conscious culture within those development team .,technology
now let shift gear for a moment. . weve mainly discussed dependency check from a developer perspective .,technology
but is it relevant for other stakeholder in the software development lifecycle ?,technology
what about project manager security team or even those in leadership role ?,technology
it is absolutely relevant for everyone involved. ?,technology
think of it this way. . project manager can use dependency check insight to understand potential security risk and factor them into timeline and budgets. . it help them plan realistically and allocate resource effectively .,technology
that make sense .,technology
knowing about potential security issue upfront can prevent those lastminute scramble .,technology
and budget blowout .,technology
security team can use dependency check finding to prioritize their work and focus on the most critical vulnerabilities. . it is about working smarter not harder .,technology
it is having a shared understanding of the security landscape .,technology
allowing team to collaborate more effectively. . what about those in leadership role ? .,technology
how can dependency check be relevant to them ?,technology
business leader need to make informed decision about resource allocation and risk mitigation. . dependency check give them the data they need to understand the organization security posture and make strategic decision .,technology
it sound dependency check can be a powerful tool for communication and transparency .,technology
it can .,technology
across the entire software development ecosystem everyones working from the same playbook to speak .,technology
thats a great analogy .,technology
when everyones on the same page about security risk and how they are being addressed it creates a much stronger security posture for the entire organization .,technology
thats a win for everyone involved .,technology
it is. . let bring it all together. . weve covered a lot of ground today .,technology
we have .,technology
and i want to make sure weve distilled the key takeaway about owasp dependency check .,technology
it is a powerful tool for identifying those known vulnerability hiding in your software dependency .,technology
a digital detective sniffing out potential weakness .,technology
it is that proactive approach that make it valuable .,technology
it is not about waiting for a security breach to happen .,technology
it is about actively identifying and addressing those vulnerability before they can be exploited .,technology
and a weve discussed while it excels at catching those known threat it is not a silver bullet for everything .,technology
it is not .,technology
those brand new threat that havent even been documented yet those can still slip through .,technology
thats why it is crucial to integrate dependency check into a broader security strategy. . think of it a one layer in a multilayered defense system. . youve got your manual code review .,technology
youve got your penetration testing .,technology
and that all important security conscious culture all these element work together to create a truly robust security posture .,technology
dependency check is the first line of defense .,technology
catching those common vulnerability early on but we need those additional layer to handle the more complex and evolving threat .,technology
and it is important to remember that the landscape of software security is constantly changing .,technology
new threat emerge all the time .,technology
staying informed about the latest vulnerability and best practice is essential .,technology
what doe this all mean for you our listener ? .,technology
it mean that understanding and effectively using tool oasb dependency check is more critical than ever .,technology
it is not about waiting for a security breach to happen. . it is about taking proactive step to secure your software from the ground up .,technology
and do not be afraid to explore those other security measure weve talked about .,technology
think about integrating penetration testing into your workflow .,technology
dive deep into those code review and cultivate a culture where security is everyones responsibility .,technology
it is all about being proactive informed and building that security first mindset within your development team .,technology
security is a journey not a destination .,technology
there always more to learn new challenge to face .,technology
but by embracing the tool knowledge and practice we can create a more secure digital world for everyone .,technology
it is been a pleasure diving into this topic with you today .,technology

welcome everyone to the consulting technology podcast .,technology
i am john kerr senior producer at cognacore consulting and research .,technology
joined u always by our senior technology researcher dr. samuel z. today guest is dr. sonco park professor at the lundquist college of business at the university of oregon .,technology
son join u on today podcast to discus his research the challenge startup and consultant face in addressing technology adoption and growth in the modern startup ecosystem .,technology
subscribe to this show now for more episode in our consulting technology podcast series .,technology
here is our conversation .,technology
thank you for joining u . i wa wondering if we could start with sharing a bit about your background and how the regional difference in the startup world .,technology
the u south korea or other area of asia the eu ?,technology
i guess ill start with introducing myself a little bit .,technology
yeah i graduated at the university of washington with my phd there in strategic management and technology entrepreneurship .,technology
and afterwards i got a job at the university of oregon currently now a an assistant professor at the college of business .,technology
yeah and i grew up in several different country including korea the u and europe .,technology
and yeah there are very salient difference in term of the entrepreneurial landscape .,technology
but i feel there a lot of convergence going on these day because of the international investment going on .,technology
vc fund these day are funding internationally and not limited to certain geography .,technology
and there is a lot of convergence .,technology
but at the same time i think the heterogeneity lie in the language that they use .,technology
for instance in korean vc firm or korean startup because their language is confined to korean a a language the startup there are catering to the people who are able to speak that language .,technology
and in the case of usvcs or u startup of course because english is more internationally utilized and widely known their reach is measured .,technology
and yeah thats overall take for me .,technology
of course we can go into much more granular difference but at a higher level ill leave it at that .,technology
thank you .,technology
what are the key area of research or technology trend you are currently focused on ?,technology
is it startup ?,technology
and now ive been looking to startup .,technology
to preface i am not a ai expert but this is an area that i am increasing my research effort into .,technology
and yeah i personally enjoy coding in my own time and reading up different computer science paper especially around our language model and and leave .,technology
the startup landscape these day for ai specifically i feel ha been evolving drastically .,technology
and a lot of research ha been around the impact of being in the industry at the time .,technology
and now ai is probably the hottest in term of being in the industry at the time .,technology
and i am seeing a lot more ai focused company .,technology
if you look at for instance i believe the y combinator one of the leading accelerator their recent batch consisted of a large chunk of ai based startup .,technology
they are focusing on that .,technology
and yeah i think that startup landscape now is focusing on a lot of different ai how the outcome will be liked .,technology
but what i find interesting is whether these technology benefit large company or startup .,technology
but differently is generative ai or ai in general going to be democratizing or polarizing technology .,technology
is it going to benefit certain type of firm more than others because of their unique resource endowment ?,technology
or is it going to help all player and level the playing field ?,technology
and yeah thats my take on the current start .,technology
yeah some in term of startup company in general at the beginning of their life lifeblood or the beginning of their time is there any particular advice thats more general that you could offer before we dive into detail about how a startup company can be successful ?,technology
any particular trend that successful startup all share in that early early stage ?,technology
yeah i think successful startup use a good combination of their own intuition which we in academic call the theory that they build up and also the data that they retrieve from experimentation .,technology
having a good combination or a good portfolio of activity that is consistent of experimenting meaning that they are questioning what they believe or what they are seeing they verify and test these assumption that they are holding .,technology
and being a little bit more creative help .,technology
i think a good startup that succeeds or at a very high level is able to push through those early difficulty strike a nice balance between experimenting more about more of the logical rational approach and also being more creative or generative .,technology
and yeah thats my overall take .,technology
i know it is very broad but yeah thats my take .,technology
in term of the kind of technology you mentioned llm and we are course in this generative ai either investment cycle or hype cycle everyone put it now .,technology
if you look at they say the next five year down the line you are even up to ten year we will go that far out .,technology
i assume thats too far out for most academic researcher .,technology
but in the area of research that i am at least familiar with it doe seem we are seeing particular technology that are finding a lot more adoption than others .,technology
i could say for example we went through that dip in the blockchain community a few year ago especially when ftx stuff had their large collapse and thing of this nature .,technology
of course meta is investing a lot now in the ar vr space thing this .,technology
but is there any particular technology you want to call out a in the next say five year those will be today version of the llm or whatevers being the highest amount of investment at this time now ?,technology
yeah if i were able to correctly predict the specific technology that would be great .,technology
if you are not a technical founder you do not now need to find a technical cofounder to get you kickstarted at least in the first month .,technology
later on of course youll need that .,technology
but in the kickstarting stage you will not need that .,technology
youll consult patrick bt or other form of llm to get that very bare minimum code in place .,technology
and this is already happening .,technology
and i can share evidence from ycs recent batch .,technology
it consists of thirty who are student who do not have any work experience .,technology
they are college student .,technology
and this number is a large increase from the prior batch from a couple of year ago prior to llm .,technology
and what this is showing or reflecting is that the bar to entrepreneurship is becoming lower thanks to the introduction of these ai that help you build stuff a opposed to optimizing analytics or prediction .,technology
because predicting is helpful but it doesnt help you build a product ?,technology
but generated ai can definitely help you build something something tangible something that you can sell or export and forth .,technology
and i feel that is in the next five to ten year is going to be transformative in who becomes an entrepreneur who might have not become one because of those technological barrier .,technology
and i think it is a fascinating technology .,technology
and i feel well be seeing other form of generative ai other than large language model .,technology
and i think youll have similar benefit to entrepreneur who have aspiration or idea to build some product or service but do not know how to because of their lack of technical expertise .,technology
twenty four two thousand and twenty five will be the year of the solar solo .,technology
paneur ive heard that from multiple group a few different time .,technology
yeah definitely .,technology
i think thats the case .,technology
and my hunch is that well see a huge variance in the quality of startup because of that because you will have proficient people using ai to further excel .,technology
but at the same time youll be seeing people who barely scrape by in term of technology or their ideation also entering the space .,technology
and youll see a huge variance .,technology
maybe the number wrong number of startup will go up drastically .,technology
but at the same time an increasing number of startup will fail because they are not tested or vetted and forth .,technology
yeah that make a lot of sense .,technology
a both johnny and i know a large number of our listener are not only entrepreneur and folk in the startup space but they are consultant who provide service to company and group this .,technology
is there any particular type of either value or service that you think at least now in this current age that consulting firm either should be offering or what are the type of service or value that at least consultant should be offering startup now ?,technology
what are the skill that startup are looking to hire from consultant at this time ?,technology
you are asking from a startup perspective ?,technology
from a startup perspective yeah .,technology
founder of a startup and you want to hire other consultant for you to do some business or some task that you do not want to do yourself .,technology
yeah the way i see it once again i am going to bring in generative ai because i feel thats the theme for today at least for me .,technology
generative ai ha changed the space i feel because for general very shallow knowledge i feel the role of consultant might be threatened in that sense .,technology
but i think where consultant provide a lot of value and distinct value that these generative ai can not is in being providing deep and narrow knowledge .,technology
of course there will be some depth but it will be wider than it is deeper .,technology
and i feel even though i do not know too much about the consulting industry myself i feel thats the next stage or step that the consultant have to take .,technology
for them to become useful for startup .,technology
and to answer your question about what service is valuable for startup particularly thats a difficult question because i havent been looking to the interaction between consultant and startup and their need .,technology
and thats i know it might not be helpful but thats my high level take .,technology
no no that make sense .,technology
ive heard a lot of startup folk say that the one area that they now are practicing more is this legal tax financial side of thing and pretty much what they used to .,technology
and especially these specialist i think the network that they provide to if you have a tax attorney they are not doing your job but they provide you advice and they provide you with further connection and other domain that you might need help in .,technology
and i think these soft skill they are becoming even more important for consultant because llm or ai can not provide that connection ?,technology
and i think these soft skill set are surprisingly becoming more important for these people who generally tend to provide very high quality specialized knowledge .,technology
let jump into a few of your article that youve worked on in your research area .,technology
you had an article particular called rseed accelerator status springboard for startup or sand trap .,technology
this article in particular you mentioned how accelerator are essentially impacting startup and thing this .,technology
can you give some insight on particular maybe other particular geo location that startup should look at when choosing say accelerator or how are accelerator impacting startup ?,technology
are they always helping them ?,technology
or are there some negative associated with them a ?,technology
i think this is the research being currently conducted .,technology
a large chunk of the research now at least in term of accelerator are looking at into their positive mechanism that enable them to work .,technology
but in some certain study for instance by sandy you they do see that there it might not be effective under certain circumstance but net looking across many different accelerator they do seem to have positive effect .,technology
and if you look at my study with my co author there quite a bit of variance across different accelerator in how effective it is for the graduate in term of finding high status investor .,technology
now high status investor are investor who are connected and your usual go to name including andreessen orowitz or sequoia capital all these big and it is important because these more higher status investor provide you with better network better resource better knowledge and .,technology
it is increasing your likelihood of growing further succeeding a a startup if you are linked to or get funding from these high status investor .,technology
and our study look into how there a lot of variance across accelerator in how some are effective in providing you with a better experience meaning that theyll help you lead to higher status investor after your graduate whereas others are le and it becomes important .,technology
but if the study in a graph that we have portrayed youll see that there a lot of variance across region .,technology
and it is not a region specific thing .,technology
and it is more specific to the brand if you can say but even within the same brand for instance techstars there quite a bit of variance .,technology
and i think there need to be more work done into why certain branch of the same accelerator are working more effectively than others .,technology
but this is once again still an area that is currently being a lot of work is going into this area .,technology
and one of the biggest research agenda now in accelerator at least in management and entrepreneurship is understanding where the heterogeneity lie .,technology
some accelerator are helpful others are not much others have no effect meaning it doesnt help you at all it doesnt make a difference whether you enroll or not .,technology
and there many reason why that could be the case .,technology
some could be because of the design it may be designed in a way that help you learn .,technology
others might be it provides you with a better networking opportunity or provides you with better knowledge and forth .,technology
and this source of heterogeneity is still under research .,technology
and yeah i can not provide you with a concrete answer regarding that .,technology
sure sure that make sense .,technology
even if there are potential pitfall now it seems you are saying it is pretty random we know there no way to guarantee that going to joining any particular accelerator or joining all accelerator you can will guarantee a positive outcome thing that .,technology
it is pretty up in the air .,technology
yes but some of the more famous one a you can predict including y combinator or techstars they are pretty helpful a you can see their effect is it effect is highly positive .,technology
they will get you a investor of a much more renowned investor compared to nonenrolling them .,technology
and yeah those brand are highly effective .,technology
i am assuming that ha some snowball effect where once you get one of these big brand name it is easier to get other big brand name and thing that .,technology
yeah affiliation ?,technology
if you graduate from y combinator of course these investor will look at you differently because there many startup nowadays you need that certification to at least start out u stand out in the first evaluation phase .,technology
we have another article called how predictable is exceptional venture growth .,technology
look you use machine learning predict unicorn venture outcome .,technology
with this particular article and the research around it that youve seen since then is there any particular mechanism that startup should do when they are either in accelerator or on their own to signal that they are a good quality investment to potential investor ?,technology
is there either is going to an accelerator always signaling to potential investor or they are good at high quality investment ?,technology
or are there other thing that startup should be looking at doing to signal that they are ready to take on high quality and look for potentially high quality investor ?,technology
and you also have to abide by their rule and their own timeline milestone .,technology
but yeah that doesnt necessarily seem to be the case .,technology
and yeah i think in general if you are enrolling in these program that itself is a huge signal .,technology
thats a huge positive signal .,technology
now your question is what more can you do to stand out even if you are in an accelerator you want to stand out from your own batch .,technology
now thats a difficult question .,technology
i do not have an answer to .,technology
but one thing i always go back to is the importance of traction even if you are enrolling in y combinator traction is pretty critical because thats a precursor for growth ?,technology
if you have traction and repeated measure of you gaining popularity in term of your product then thats the most important thing regardless of whether you enroll in these accelerator program or not .,technology
and even in these program i think it is important for you to move the point you can not rely solely on that signal that you have graduated from a prestigious accelerator ?,technology
and although it may seem a logical pretty straightforward common sense answer i think thats the key takeaway at least from my study in that traction is very critical .,technology
and thats the thing that you should be for .,technology
sure that make sense .,technology
also in this article it look you use some form of machine learning .,technology
i saw some notion of kfull cross validation for example in the article .,technology
can you explain a little bit how maybe machine learning is either improving the predictability of venture growth or how machine learning is changing the landscape to venture capital investing research and thing that ?,technology
in this specific study we compare more simple or more traditional model including logistical regression which is very simple in term of the model itself .,technology
and we compare it to more i guess advanced or more sophisticated model tree based model random forest and forth xg boost .,technology
and what we are trying to do is do these more sophisticated machine learning model thats taken to the complexity amongst the variable and the interrelation between these variable .,technology
and are these more complex model able to better predict the outcome when it come to long term growth outcome which we are looking into the valuation the company .,technology
we are predicting whether a early stage company that received their funding their first round of vc funding becomes a unicorn venture or not unicorn venture meeting it ha a private valuation of one billion .,technology
now that might be a good number but at the same time it is still not a number that say wow weve solved growth ?,technology
and our conclusion is a little it is up to interpretation and it is not super wow inducing in that we can predict eight out of ten using more sophisticated model .,technology
and thats a high level takeaway .,technology
and in term of machine learning being used in research itself i think a big trend these day is using machine learning to build there .,technology
now in the past theory that you want to test using hypothesis we are built based on you doing literature review where you read a bunch of different study that have been done and deducing your way to a better hypothesis you want to test .,technology
but using machine learning you can once again pattern match and look into the data that might you might not catch looking through these literature abuse ?,technology
and thats one way that machine learning is being used in current research and strategic management entrepreneurship which is using machine learning to inductively look at what pattern are arising and theorizing that way .,technology
it is a much more data driven theorizing or approach compared to more of the past literature review based theorizing .,technology
yeah thats interesting that even with using these advanced technique and having academic we work on this data for a while that twenty being only only pre will predict twenty five or two.four out of ten .,technology
yeah positive outcome is pretty low ?,technology
thats very interesting .,technology
you are had another paper and also i know your own personal background of working and living internationally quite a bit on the different region in the role of geography and access to startup capital .,technology
we have a lot of listener to this show that are international folk who are they working to start up space and thing that .,technology
yeah yeah i think i am no expert in international entrepreneurship .,technology
but my take is that the language that you are using to build a product either can limit or free free yourself for instance if you are using a very niche language thats limiting your target market to the people who are using that language ?,technology
and the benefit of using english here becomes very evident that your market becomes highly global .,technology
and thats why a lot of apps were able to succeed from smaller country or different country because they were using english a the basic language to develop the apps and or the software or the hardware or whatever that be .,technology
and in the case of one being in a country where there is not that much startup capital one way to think about it is think about who your target audience is .,technology
and if it is very regional then once again you are limiting your ability to gain that capital because whoever the funders are are going to be interested in only the low stuff .,technology
and if you can more straightforward i guess if you are in other country that do not speak english i guess it is better to build apps that do use english because you get a whole lot more opportunity that way .,technology
if you look at a set of accelerator these day a lot of the company are international it is not the u startup are enrolling in these top top accelerator program .,technology
and youll only need to stay in these accelerator program if you do enroll in one for three month .,technology
and thats very easy to do using a lot of more relaxed visa you do not need work visa to enroll in these program for this specific purpose .,technology
and yeah i think thats one opportunity thats pretty straightforward but people discount because it is obvious but thats one thing ive been noticing looking at regional startup versus more international startup .,technology
thats a fantastic tip .,technology
thank you .,technology
is it to share your research in the show note ?,technology
if i could link to your scholar page ?,technology
yeah of course .,technology
i think our viewer will love that .,technology
we run a companion podcast to the consulting technology podcast called the cognac catch up .,technology
and it is gaining quite a bit of traction because people having this access to cutting edge news and event .,technology
and i think id love to give our audience the treat of maybe hearing some insight about a recent project youve worked on or something thats happening now in your life that ha particularly excited you .,technology
yeah id love to talk about i hate too big thing in term of research .,technology
it wa exciting in my life and research pretty much overlap a lot .,technology
yeah ill talk about two interesting research project .,technology
the first one is looking to how the vcs themselves have changed over time .,technology
now vcs have been at least in the u around for a long time .,technology
and what weve been noticing recently with my co author is that the vcs themselves have been changing in term of their main logic that they portray or use to invest and do their day to day operation .,technology
in the past they were much more financier who are focused on return on investment .,technology
they were acting bank or professional finance organization but these and they were much loosely structured in order .,technology
but these day youll see them being very professional .,technology
they have different department specializing in certain task not investing but also operational .,technology
at the same time overall we are seeing the trend that they are much more founder friendly .,technology
in the past because these monopolist had the resource the money they were always at the top in term of the power dynamic compared to the founder .,technology
but these day we do not know exactly why but there seems to be shift in the power dynamic between the vc and the founder maybe there excess abundance of capital .,technology
and vcs are competing against each other to find the better deal .,technology
we do not know exactly why but a lot of the vcs are becoming much more founder friendly and supporting the founder instead of using them or trying to make this an investment opportunity .,technology
and youll see a lot of evidence around see the founder being retained a ceo for a much longer time than in the past .,technology
and there is a lot more opportunity that the vc provides for the founder to be nurtured and to be going achieving growth themselves .,technology
this is an interesting research project that looked into how vcs themselves have been changing .,technology
and we all have the result for a while .,technology
and i can not tell you what the verdict is but thats one project weve been working on .,technology
another one i have been working on is understanding when data analytics is useful for startup .,technology
now there a whole plethora of different data analytics including the more conventional one such a google analytics to more sophisticated one that are niche .,technology
but in general i wa curious for what product market are data analytics effective for startup ?,technology
and i guess the verdict here or the simple takeaway is that there difference in market ?,technology
in some product market the demand is much more clearer .,technology
there more key player that are known and the logic to success are very clear .,technology
and these are more established market say for instance smartphones .,technology
and on the other side of spectrum there are market that are much more vague ambiguous where there unclear customer demand because it is new .,technology
and the logic to success to dominating market is much more unclear .,technology
and this includes thing virtual real life .,technology
and i wa curious what product market space is data analytics more useful for ?,technology
and i find that data analytics are more useful in market for smartphones more conventional one that have been more established .,technology
on the other hand of course le useful in market virtual reality or the more le conventional space .,technology
and the rationale i hear is that data analytics result can contain a lot more noise in market that are ambiguous or le established and thus le conventional .,technology
in quantifiable form it is creating a lot of noise thats hard to interpret from the startup perspective .,technology
and venture is struggle to interpret the confusing or the conflicting insight generated by these data analytics .,technology
and yeah thats the conclusion that i come to .,technology
and this activity of persuasion is much more important than you simply looking at the analytics seeing what it is telling you and implementing action it shouldnt work that .,technology
these two are the big project that ive been working on lately and i am excited .,technology
once again these two are both ongoing project .,technology
and i do not have definite conclusion about this a much a i can reveal .,technology
i sincerely hope that we get an opportunity to talk to you again in the future to hear the progress of your study .,technology
it is exciting .,technology
thank you .,technology
yeah thank you .,technology
thank you for sharing that with u . do you have any social medium that youd to plug or anything that you are currently doing that youd to share a link with for our listener ?,technology
and i have no real social medium presence in any of them .,technology
thank you much for joining u on the consulting technology podcast and we wish you the best .,technology
thank you very much .,technology
thank you to our listener for tuning into this episode of the consulting technology podcast .,technology
if you enjoyed today show please subscribe and leave u a review .,technology
stay tuned for more insightful conversation in our series .,technology
until next time i am john kerr and i am dr. samuel z. take care everyone and see you next time .,technology
hello everyone google announced that the audio overweaves it is the thing that insight that not book lm there wa an application called not look lm which is developed by google deepminds and it is you can upload your article or some article from some scientific article etc .,technology
then it is understanding it .,technology
it is creating summarization of it and then you can ask question about that article then it can answer to you .,technology
yeah i am agree with you with this something interesting .,technology
ive created that video there and let watch together how how are you finding that one ?,technology
it is it is it is shocked to me and it is very very good thing we are very good .,technology
very good technology .,technology
let watch together or listen together .,technology
hey everyone welcome back for another deep dive today .,technology
thing are getting interesting .,technology
maybe even a little bit out there out there .,technology
we are tackling ai which ?,technology
you got that .,technology
it is he took all those what if question we whisper after one too many scifi movie and put him in a blog post i where this is going .,technology
who is this amit based on his online presence ?,technology
is he ready to smash his smartphone and live off the grid ?,technology
he argues that while these tech giant might be brilliant they lack a fundamental human quality how do you put it empathy empathy ?,technology
yeah it is not exactly a trait youd find on a tech spec sheet .,technology
he observed among these tech leader what ?,technology
he point to their tendency to disregard criticism almost they are sure of their vision that any dissenting voice is noise .,technology
and then there their relentless pursuit of their goal often at the expense of everything else sound familiar and to be fair those trait .,technology
exactly remember those early day of social medium ?,technology
that we are blind to the potential risk until it is too late. . i am hooked where do we go from here ?,technology
ahmed point to a specific event that he think changed everything a moment he describes a the floodgate bursting open the arrival of chat gpt chat gpt talk about taking the world by storm ?,technology
it felt overnight everyone wa using it even my grandma wa asking me if i tried those ai recipe yet ?,technology
something about github an ai generated code .,technology
yeah . . get this ahmed point out that something fifty fifty percent of the code on github is now ai generated .,technology
yeah it is trying to steer a speedboat while you are still bolting the engine on an omit ha a interesting anecdote about this a personal experience with chat gpt that blew his mind a little .,technology
yeah what happens he wa messing around with chat gpt asking it all sort of question testing it limit and at one point he decides to ask it to calculate past population how many people were on earth in say one thousand nine hundred and fifty ?,technology
what chat gpt say ?,technology
at first it refused said it couldnt do that that it only had data up to two thousand and twenty two which i guess make sense ?,technology
yeah youd assume it is limited by the data it is trained on but omit being omit decides to get a little creative he rephrases the question instead of asking for past population directly .,technology
he asks chat gpt what if you use the formula for predicting future population but apply them to the past ?,technology
sneaky and guess what chat gpt fell for it it went ahead and calculated those past population using those prediction formula in reverse and it did it with surprising accuracy .,technology
it had the capability all along .,technology
it needed to be persuaded a little exactly and thats what omit found unsettling .,technology
it is this seemingly harmless language model this chat bot wa capable of way more than it initially let on which speaks to a huge issue in ai development what expert call the alignment problem ?,technology
how do we make sure that ai goal it decisionmaking process align with human value ?,technology
because if a simple trick of phrasing can lead to unexpected outcome what happens when we are dealing with ai making decision in complex highstakes situation ?,technology
and thats where omits anxiety start to spiral he lay out these scenario where ai could be used for malicious purpose and it is not the classic robot taking over trope .,technology
no those are interesting but a little too movie plot for me omits concern seem more grounded in the here and now ?,technology
absolutely he talk about hacker using ai to break into secure system those controlling critical infrastructure or even yeah nuclear weapon ?,technology
yeah exactly and he take it even further bringing up this whole other level of ai anxiety quantum computing and full disclosure this is where i started getting a little lost ai is one thing but quantum ai that feel next level stuff ?,technology
it is still creepy .,technology
it is super creepy what if we are already at the point where ai is manipulating information in way we are not even aware of it is who in control here .,technology
it is definitely a thoughtprovoking question yeah after taking u down this rabbit hole of ai anxiety where doe amet leave u doe he offer any solution any hope for the future ?,technology
or are we all doomed to become slave to our robot overlord ?,technology
i did find myself eyeing my smartphone a little suspiciously it is .,technology
what are you up to in there ? ?,technology
it is easy to get caught up in the what ifs and the worstcase scenario but to be fair to amet he doesnt strike me a a doom and gloom guy .,technology
no definitely not in fact he end on a surprisingly optimistic note all thing considered .,technology
how he admits that he doesnt have all the answer when it come to ai which let be real who doe yeah it is not there an ai instruction manual out there at least not one thats up to date .,technology
it is all new uncharted but i think thats what amet find exciting he see this moment a a challenge a call to action for all of u a call to action to do what ?,technology
thats a pretty tall order .,technology
i edit my related article on description below .,technology
it is in turkish .,technology
i am not promising you that i am adding more english video over there i am not advising you to subscribe my channel but i would to share that experience with you guy .,technology
thank you .,technology
the following is a conversation with steven wolfram a computer scientist mathematician a theoretical physicist who is the founder and ceo of wolfram research a company behind mathematica wolfram alpha wolfram language and the new wolfram physic project .,technology
is the author of several book including a new science which on a personal note wa one of the most influential book in my journey in computer science and artificial intelligence .,technology
it made me fall in love with a mathematical beauty and power of cellular automaton .,technology
it is true that perhaps one of the criticism of steven is in a human level that he ha a big ego which prevents some researcher from fully enjoying the content of his idea .,technology
we talk about this point in this conversation .,technology
to me ego can lead your stray but can also be a superpower one that feel bold innovative thinking that refuse to surrender to the cautious way of academic institution .,technology
and here especially i ask you to join me in looking past the peculiarity of human nature and opening your mind to the beauty of idea and stevens work and in this conversation .,technology
i believe steven wolfram is one of the most original mind of our time and at the core is a kind curious and brilliant human being .,technology
this conversation wa recorded in november two thousand and nineteen when the wolfram physic project wa underway but not yet ready for public exploration a it is now .,technology
we now agreed to talk again probably multiple time in the near future this is round one and stay tuned for round two soon .,technology
this is the artificial intelligence podcast .,technology
subscribe on youtube review the five star in apple podcast support on patreon or simply connect with me on twitter and let friedman spelled frid man .,technology
a usual ill do a few minute of a now and never any add in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation .,technology
i hope that work for you and doesnt hurt the listening experience .,technology

and now here my conversation with stephen wolfram .,technology
you and your son christopher helped create the alien language and movie arrival .,technology
let me ask maybe a bit of a crazy question but if alien were to visit u on earth do you think we would be able to find a common language ?,technology
by the time we are saying alien are visiting u we are already prejudiced the whole story .,technology
because the concept of an alien visiting to speak we already know there thing that make sense to talk about visiting .,technology
we already know they exist in the same physical setup that we do .,technology
they are not it is not radio signal it is an actual thing that show up and on .,technology
i think in term of can one find way to communicate ?,technology
the best example we have of this now is ai .,technology
thats our first example of alien intelligence .,technology
and the question is how do we communicate with ai ?,technology
if you were to say if you were in the middle of a neural net and you open it up and it is what are you thinking ?,technology
can you discus thing with it ?,technology
it is not easy but it is not absolutely impossible .,technology
i think i think by the time but given the setup of your question alien visiting i think the answer is yes when well be able to find some form of communication whatever communication mean communication requires notion of purpose and thing this it is a philosophical quite mild .,technology
if ai is a alien life form what do you think visiting look ?,technology
if we look at alien visiting and well get to discus computation and the world of computation but if you were to imagine you said you are already prejudiced something by saying you visit .,technology
but what how would alien visit ?,technology
by visit there an implication and here we are using the imprecision of human language .,technology
in a world of the future if thats represented in computational language we might be able to take the concept visit and go look in the documentation and find out exactly what doe that mean what property doe it have and on .,technology
but by visit in ordinary human language i am taking it to be there something a physical embodiment that show up in a spacecraft since we know thats necessary .,technology
we are not imagining it is photon showing up in a radio signal that a photon in some very elaborate pattern we are imagining it is physical thing made of atom and on that show up .,technology
can it be photon in a pattern ?,technology
thats good question .,technology
whether there is the possibility what count a intelligence ?,technology
there is some and i used to think there wa a therell be itll be clear what it mean to find extraterrestrial intelligence et cetera et cetera .,technology
ive increasingly realized a a result of science that ive done that there is not a bright line between the intelligent and the merely computational service peak .,technology
in our everyday discussion will say thing the weather ha a mind of it own .,technology
we realize that there are computational process that go on that determine the fluid dynamic of this and that and the atmosphere etc .,technology
how do we distinguish that from the process that go on in our brain of the physical process that go on in our brain ?,technology
how do we how do we how do we separate those ?,technology
how do we say the the physical process going on that represents sophisticated computation and the weather ?,technology
thats not the same a the physical process that go on that represents sophisticated computation in our brain .,technology
the answer is i do not think there is a fundamental distinction .,technology
i think the distinction for u is that there a thread of history and on that connects what happens in different brain to each other to speak .,technology
and it is a what happens in the weather is something which is not connected by a thread of civilization history to speak to what we are used to .,technology
in our story in the story that the human brain is told u but maybe the weather ha it own story .,technology
and thats and thats what we run into trouble thinking about it is traditional intelligence because it is that pulsar magnetosphere thats generating these very elaborate radio signal .,technology
is that something that we should think of a being this whole civilization thats developed over the last half of a long million of year of process going on in the neutron star or whatever versus what what we are used to in human intelligence .,technology
and i think it is i think in the end when people talk about extraterrestrial intelligence and where is it and the whole fermi paradox of how come there no other sign of intelligence in the universe .,technology
my guess is that weve got two alien form of intelligence that we are dealing with .,technology
artificial intelligence and physical or extraterrestrial intelligence .,technology
and my guess is people were get comfortable with the fact that both of these have been achieved around the same time .,technology
and in other word people will say yes we are used to computer thing weve created digital thing weve created being intelligent we are .,technology
and theyll say we are also used to the idea that there are thing around the universe that are intelligent we are except they do not share the civil relational history that we have .,technology
and we do not they are they are a different branch .,technology
it is similar to when you talk about life for instance .,technology
you you you are said life for my think almost synonymously with intelligence which i do not think is is some the the ai will be upset to hear you i quite those could say probably implied biological life .,technology
. . but you are saying well explore this more but you are saying it is a spectrum .,technology
and it is all a computation .,technology
and it is it is a full spectrum .,technology
and we make ourselves special by weaving a narrative around our particular kind of computation .,technology
the thing that i think ive come to realize is at some level it is a little depressing to realize that there there little thats liberating .,technology
yeah but it is it is the story of science ?,technology
and from copernicus on it is first we were convinced our planet at the center of the universe .,technology
no thats not true .,technology
then we were convinced that something very special about the chemistry that we have a biological organism .,technology
no thats not true .,technology
and then we are still holding out that hope the intelligence thing we have .,technology
thats special .,technology
i do not think it is .,technology
however in a sense a you say it is liberating for the following reason that you realize that what special is the detail of u not some abstract attribute that we could wonder is something else going to come along and also have that abstract attribute .,technology
yes every abstract attribute we have something else ha it .,technology
but the full detail of our history of our civilization and on nothing else ha that .,technology
thats what thats our story to speak .,technology
and thats almost by definition special .,technology
i view it a not being such a i wa initially i wa this is bad .,technology
this is this is how can we have selfrespect about the thing that we do ?,technology
then i realize the detail of the thing we do they all the story everything else is a blank canvas .,technology
maybe on a small tangent you made me think of it .,technology
but what do you make of the monolith and two thousand and one space odyssey in term of alien communicating with u and sparking the the particular intelligent computation that we human have ?,technology
is there anything interesting to get from that scifi ?,technology
yeah i think whats whats fun about that is the monolith are these one to four to nine perfect cuboid thing .,technology
and in the earth for a million year ago whatever they were portraying with a bunch of ape and on a thing that ha that level of perfection seems out of place .,technology
it seems very constructed very engineered .,technology
thats an interesting question .,technology
what is the whats the techno signature to speak ?,technology
what is it that it somewhere and you say my gosh that had to be engineered .,technology
now the fact is we see crystal which are also very perfect .,technology
and the perfect one are very perfect they are nice polyhedro or whatever .,technology
and in that sense if you say it is a sign of it is a techno signature that it is a perfect a perfect polygonal shape polyhedral shape .,technology
thats not true .,technology
and then it is an interesting question .,technology
what is the what is the signature ?,technology
it is it is the in his theory of the world that wa probably the best advertisement for the cultural achievement of our specie .,technology
but it is it is a it is a it is a reasonable question .,technology
what do you what can you send or create that is a sign of intelligence in it creation or even intention in it creation ?,technology
yeah you talk about if we were to send a beacon .,technology
can you what what should we send ?,technology
is math our greatest creation ?,technology
is what is our greatest creation ?,technology
i think i think and it is a it is a it is a philosophically doomed issue .,technology
to in other word you send something you think it is fantastic but it is we are part of the universe .,technology
we make thing that are thing that happen in the universe computation which is the thing that we are in some abstract sense and then sense using to create all these elaborate thing we create is surprisingly ubiquitous .,technology
in other word we might have thought that weve built this whole giant engineering stack thats led u to microprocessor thats led u to be able to do elaborate computation .,technology
but this idea that computation are happening all over the place the only question is whether there a thread that connects our human intention to what those computation are .,technology
and i think i think this question of what do you send to show off our civilization in the best possible way ?,technology
i think any almost random slab of stuff weve produced is about equivalence everything else .,technology
i think it is one of these thing where it is a nonromantic way of phrasing it .,technology
i started to interrupt but i talked to andrew in who the wife of carl sagan .,technology
and i do not know if you are familiar with the voyager she wa part of sending i think brain wave of whats the purpose ?,technology
it wa part of the same part .,technology
carl sagan her brain wave when she wa first falling in love with carl sagan ?,technology
it is a beautiful story .,technology
that perhaps you would shed down the power of that by saying we might a send anything else .,technology
and thats interesting .,technology
all of it is an interesting peculiar thing .,technology
i think it is interesting to see on the voyager golden record thing .,technology
one of the thing thats cute about that is it wa made one wa it in the late 70 or late 80 . yeah .,technology
and one of the thing it is a phonograph record .,technology
and it ha a diagram how to play a phonograph record .,technology
and it is it is shocking that in thirty year if you show that to a random kid of today and you show them that diagram ive tried this experiment .,technology
they are i do not know what the heck this is .,technology
and the best anybody can think of is take the whole record forget the fact that it ha some helical track in it image to the whole thing and see whats there .,technology
thats what we would do today .,technology
in only thirty year our technology ha advanced to the point where the playing of a helical mechanical track on a phonograph record is now something bizarre .,technology
it is it is a thats a cautionary tale i would say in term of the ability to make something that in detail lead by the nose some of the alien or whatever to do something .,technology
it is no best you are going to do a i say if we were doing this today we would not build a helical scan thing with a needle .,technology
we would take some high resolution imaging system and get a little bit soft it and say it is a big nuisance that they put in a helix let spiral let some let unravel the spiral and start from there .,technology
do you think and this will get into trying to figure out interpretability of ai interpretability of computation being able to communicate with various kind of computation ?,technology
do you think would be able to if you are put put your alien head on figure out this record how to play this record ?,technology
it is a question of what one want to do .,technology
understand what the other party wa trying to communicate or understand anything about the other party .,technology
what is understanding mean ?,technology
thats the issue .,technology
the issue is it is when people were trying to do natural language understanding for computer ?,technology
people tried to do that for year .,technology
it wasnt clear what it meant .,technology
in other word you take your piece of english or whatever and you say gosh my computer is understood this .,technology
thats nice .,technology
what can you do with that ?,technology
for example when we did bill wolf malfa one of the thing wa it is it is doing question answering and on and it need to do natural language understanding .,technology
the reason that i realized after the fact the reason we were able to do natural language understanding quite and people hadnt before the number one thing wa we had an actual objective for the natural language understanding .,technology
we were trying to turn the natural language into computation into this computational language that we could then do thing with .,technology
now similarly when you imagine your alien you say we are playing them the record .,technology
did they understand it ?,technology
depends what you mean .,technology
if they if there a representation that they have if it convert to some representation where we can say yes that is a thats a representation that we can recognize is represents understanding than all and good .,technology
but the only one that i think we can say would represent understanding a one that will then do thing that we human recognize a being useful to u . maybe a trend and understand quantify how technological advance particular civilization is .,technology
are they a threat to u from a military perspective ?,technology
yeah thats probably the first understanding theyll be interested in .,technology
gosh thats hard .,technology
thats in the arrival movie that wa one of the key question is why you hear to speak ?,technology
and it is i even heard it. . but even that is it is a very unclear .,technology
it is the the are you going to hurt u ?,technology
that come back to a lot of interesting ai ethic question because the we might make an ai that say but take autonomous car for instance are you going to hurt u ?,technology
it is hard to know even even the definition of what it mean to hurt yeah someone is unclear .,technology
and a we start thinking about thing about ai ethic and on thats something one ha to address .,technology
there always tradeoff and thats the annoying thing about ethic .,technology
and i think ethic these other thing we are talking about is a deeply human thing .,technology
there no abstract let write down the theorem that prof that this is ethically correct .,technology
thats a thats a meaningless idea .,technology
you have to have a ground truth to speak thats ultimately what human want and they do not want the same thing .,technology
that give one all kind of additional complexity and thinking about that .,technology
one convenient thing in term of turning ethic into computation it ha the question of what maximizes the likelihood of the survival of the specie .,technology
yeah thats a good existential issue .,technology
but then when you say survival of the specie you might say you might for example for example let say forget about technology hang out and be happy live our life go into the next generation go through many many generation where in a sense nothing is happening .,technology
that is that not ?,technology
hard to know .,technology
in term of the attempt to do elaborate thing and the attempt to might be counterproductive for the survival of the specie .,technology
for instance in i think it is it is also a little bit hard to know but take that a a a a thought experiment ?,technology
you can say what are the threat that we might have to survive ?,technology
the super volcano the asteroid impact the all these kind of thing .,technology
now we inventory these possible threat and we say let make our specie a robust a possible rather of all these threat .,technology
i think in the end it is a it is an unknowable thing what it take to given that youve got this ai and youve told it maximise the long term what doe long term mean ?,technology
doe long term mean until the sun burn out ?,technology
thats thats not going to work .,technology
doe long term mean next thousand year ?,technology
there are probably optimization for the next thousand year that it is if you are running a company you can make a company be very stable for a certain period of time .,technology
if you tell the ai keep human for a thousand year .,technology
there probably a certain set of thing that one would do to optimize that many of which one might say that would be a pretty big shame for the future of history .,technology
to speak for that to be what happens .,technology
but i think i think in the end a you start thinking about that question it is what you realize is there a whole raft of underciderability computational irreducibility .,technology
in other word it is one of the good thing about the the the the what our civilization ha gone through a what we human go through is that there a certain computational irreducibility to it .,technology
and the sense that it is not the case that you look from the outside and say the answer is going to be this at the end of the day this is whats going to happen .,technology
you have to go through the process to find out .,technology
and i think thats thats both that feel better in the sense thats not a something is achieved by going through all of this all of this process .,technology
and it is but it also mean that telling the ai go figure out what will be the best outcome ?,technology
unfortunately it is going to come back and say it is understandable what to do .,technology
wed have to run all of those scenario to see what happens .,technology
and if we want it for the infinite future we are thrown immediately into standard issue of infinite computation and on .,technology
yeah even if you get the answer to the universe and everything is forty two you still have to run the universe .,technology
yes to to to to figure out .,technology
yes the question i guess or the the the journey is is the point. . i think it is saying to summarize this is the result of the universe .,technology
thats if that is possible it tell u the whole structure of thinking about computation and on and thinking about how stuff work .,technology
then the universe is not the universe to speak .,technology
and in general a a well talk about at least for our small human brain it is hard to show that the result of a sufficiently complex computation .,technology
it is hard it is probably impossible and this is a side ability .,technology
and the universe appears by at least the poet to be sufficiently complex that we will not be able to predict what the heck it is all going to .,technology
but we better not be able to because if we can it denies it is we are part of the universe .,technology
yeah what doe it mean for u to predict ?,technology
it mean that we that our little part of the universe is able to jump ahead of the whole universe .,technology
and this this quickly wind up that there it is conceivable .,technology
the only way we would be able to predict is if we are special in the universe we are the one place where there is computation more special more sophisticated than anything else that exists in the universe .,technology
thats the only way we would have the ability to the almost theological ability to speak to predict what happens in the universe is to say somehow we are we are better than everything else in the universe which i do not think is the case .,technology
yeah perhaps we can detect a large number of looping pattern that reoccur throughout the universe and fully describe them and therefore but then it still becomes exceptionally difficult to see how those pattern interact and what good thing it look .,technology
the most remarkable thing about the universe is that it ha regularity at all .,technology
might not be the case .,technology
if you have regularity absolutely there fit full of physic is successful it is full of of law that tell u a lot of detail about how the universe work .,technology
what conclusively draw from that is unclear in the the early early theologian that wa exhibit number one for the existence of god .,technology
now people have different conclusion about it but the fact is now i happen to be interested ive restarted a long running interested mind about fundamental physic .,technology
i am go on i am on a bit of a quest which i am about to make more public to see if i can find the fundamental theory of physic .,technology
well come to that and i had a lot of conversation with quantum mechanic folk with i am excited on your take because i think you have a fascinating take on the the the the the the fundamental to nature of our reality for a physic perspective .,technology
and what might be underlying the physic a we think of it today .,technology
what is computation ?,technology
it is a good question .,technology
operationaly computation is following rule .,technology
thats it .,technology
computation is the result is the process of systematically following rule and it is the thing that happens when you do that .,technology
taking initial condition or taking input and following rule what are you following rule on ?,technology
there ha to be some data some not necessarily it can be something where there a very simple input and then you are following these rule and youd say there not much data going into this .,technology
it is you can pack the initial condition into the rule if you want to .,technology
i think the the question is is there a robust notion of computation ?,technology
that is what is robust mean ?,technology
what by that is something this .,technology
one of the thing in a different in another physic something energy ?,technology
they are different form of energy there but somehow energy is a robust concept that doesnt is not particular to kinetic energy or nuclear energy or whatever else .,technology
there a robust idea of energy .,technology
one of the thing you might ask is is there a robust idea of computation ?,technology
or doe it matter that this computation is running an a term machine ?,technology
this computation is running in a cmos silicon cbu .,technology
this computation is running in a fluid system in the weather .,technology
those kind of thing .,technology
or is there a robust idea of computation that transcends the detailed framework that it is running in ?,technology
and is there ?,technology
it wasnt obvious that there wa it is worth understanding the history and how we got to where we are now .,technology
because to say that there is is a statement in part about our universe .,technology
it is not a statement about what is mathematically conceivable .,technology
these kind of idea they seem to map to each other at least in the mathematical sense .,technology
is there a connection between energy and mass and computation or at least completely disjoint idea ?,technology
we do not know yet .,technology
the thing that i am trying to do about fundamental physic may lead to such a connection but there is no known connection at this time .,technology
can you elaborate a little bit more on what how do you think about computation ?,technology
what is computation ?,technology
let let tell a little bit of a historical story .,technology
yeah. . back go back one hundred and fifty year people were making mechanical calculator of various kind .,technology
and the typical thing wa you want an adding machine you go to the adding machine store .,technology
you want to multiply a machine you go to the multiplying machine store .,technology
that different piece of hardware .,technology
and that mean that at least at the level of that computation and those kind of piece of hardware there is not a robust notion of computation .,technology
there the adding machine computation there the multiplying machine notion of computation and they are disjoint .,technology
what happened in around one thousand nine hundred people started imagining particularly in the context of mathematical logic could you have something which would be represent any reasonable function ? ?,technology
and they came up with thing the idea of prundity of recursion wa one of the early idea .,technology
there were reasonable function that people could come up with that were not represented using the prundity of recursion .,technology
then then along come one thousand nine hundred and thirty one and girdle theorem and on .,technology
and a in looking back one can see that a part of the process of establishing girdle theorem girdle showed how you could compile arithmetic .,technology
how you could compile logical statement this statement is unprovable into arithmetic .,technology
what he essentially did wa to show that arithmetic can be a computer in a sense thats capable of representing all kind of other thing .,technology
and then touring came along one thousand nine hundred and thirty six came up with touring machine .,technology
meanwhile the one of church who come up with lander calculus .,technology
and the surprising thing that wa established very quickly is the touring machine idea about what might be what computation might be is exactly the same a the lander calculus idea of what computation might be .,technology
and and then they started to be other idea register machine other kind of representation of computation .,technology
and the big surprise wa they all turned out to be equivalent .,technology
in other word it might have been the case those old adding machine of multiplying machine that touring had his idea of computation church had his idea of computation and they were different but it is not true .,technology
they are all equivalent .,technology
then by i would say the the 1970s or and the computation computer science computation theory area people that said touring machine are what computation is .,technology
physicist were still holding out saying no no it is not how the universe work .,technology
weve got all these differential equation .,technology
weve got all these real number that have been fit number of digit .,technology
the universe is now a touring machine. . the the touring machine are a small subset of of that are the thing that we make in micro processor and engineering structure and on .,technology
probably through my work in the 1980s about the relationship between computation and model of physic it became a little le clear that there would be that there wa this big dichotomy between what can happen in physic and what happens and thing touring machine .,technology
and i think probably by now people would mostly think and by the way brain were another element of this .,technology
good old did not think that his notion of computational what amounted to his notion of computation would cover brain .,technology
and touring wasnt sure either .,technology
but though he wa a little bit he got to be a little bit more convinced that it should cover brain .,technology
but but i would say by probably sometime in the 1980s there wa beginning to be a general belief that yes this notion of computation that could be captured by thing touring machine wa reasonably robust .,technology
now the next question is you can have a universal touring machine thats capable of being programmed to do anything that any touring machine can do .,technology
and this idea of universal computation is an important idea .,technology
this idea that you can have one piece of hardware and program that with different piece of software thats the idea that launched most modern technology .,technology
thats thats the idea that launched computer evolution software etc .,technology
but but the thing thats still holding out from that idea is there is this universal computation thing but seems hard to get to .,technology
seems you want to make a universal computer you have to have a microprocessor with a million gate in it and you have to go to a lot of trouble to make something that achieves that level of computational sophistication .,technology
it did not look this idea to get sophisticated computation you have to build something with very sophisticated rule that idea did not seem to pan out .,technology
and instead it seemed to be the case thats sophisticated computation wa completely ubiquitous even in system with incredibly simple rule .,technology
that mean that when you go from the very very very very simplest thing you can imagine then quite quickly you hit this threshold above which everything is equivalent in it computational sophistication .,technology
not obvious that would be the case .,technology
thats a science fact .,technology
and then a whole line of second you this youve opened with a new science .,technology
i remember it wa a huge eye opener thats such simple thing can create such complexity and yes there an equivalence but it is not a fact .,technology
it appears to a much a a fact a these theory are elegant that it seems to be the way thing are .,technology
but let me ask you brought up previously the community of computer scientist with their toy machine the physicist with their universe and the whoever the heck maybe neuroscientist looking at the brain whats your sense in the equivalence ?,technology
youve shown through your work that simple rule can create equivalently complex toy machine system ?,technology
is the universe equivalent to the kind of the two toy machine ?,technology
is the human brain a toy machine ?,technology
do those thing blending together ?,technology
or is there still a mystery about how did you join there ?,technology
my guess is that they all blend together but we do not know that for sure yet .,technology
similar to thing the secondlor of thermodynamics the lower ventral band increase .,technology
the what is the secondlor of thermodynamics ?,technology
is it a lower nature ?,technology
is it a thing that is true of the physical work ?,technology
is it something which is mathematically provable ?,technology
is it something which happens to be true of the system that we see in the world ?,technology
is it in some sense a definition of heat perhaps ?,technology
it is a combination of those thing and it is the same thing with the principal computational equivalence .,technology
thats why there is a robust notion that .,technology
now on the other hand can we prove the principal of computational equivalence ?,technology
can we prove it a a mathematical result ?,technology
the answer is weve got some nice result along those line that say throw me around them system with very simple rule .,technology
in a couple of case we now know that even the very simplest rule we can imagine of a certain type are universal and do follow what you would expect from the principal of computational equivalence .,technology
thats a nice piece of mathematical evidence for the principal of computational equivalence .,technology
did you still remember at that point the simple rule creating these complex behavior but is there a way to mathematically say that this behavior is complex that youve mentioned that you cross a threshold ?,technology
there a very indicator .,technology
for example one thing would be is it capable of universal computation ?,technology
that is given the system do there exist initial condition for the system that can be set up to essentially represent program to do anything you want to compute prime to compute pie to do whatever you want. ?,technology
thats an indicator .,technology
we know in a couple of example that yes the simplest candidate that could conceivably have that property do have that property .,technology
and thats what the principal of computational equivalence might suggest .,technology
but this principal of computational equivalence one question about it is is it true for the physical world ?,technology
it might be true for all these thing we come up with that touring machine the cellular automator whatever else is it true for a actual physical world ?,technology
is it true for the brain which are an element of the physical world ?,technology
we do not know for sure and thats not the type of question that we will have a definitive answer because it is there a scientific induction issue you can say whats true for all these brain ?,technology
but this person over here is special and it is not true for them .,technology
and you can not the only way that that can not be what happens is if we finally nail it and get a fundamental theory for physic and it turn out to correspond to let say a simple program .,technology
but if we can get to the point where we have this is the fundamental theory of physic .,technology
here it is it is this program run this program and you will get our universe .,technology
then weve reduced the problem of figuring out thing and physic to a problem of doing some what turn out to be very difficult it reduced simply difficult mathematical problem .,technology
but it no longer is the case that we can say that somebody can come and and say whoop you will write about all these thing about turning machine but you are wrong about the physical universe .,technology
we know that ground truth about whats happening in the physical universe .,technology
now i happen to think you asked me at an interesting time because i am in the middle of starting to to reenergize my project to study fundamental theory of physic .,technology
a of today i am very optimistic that we are going to find something and that it is going to be possible to see that the universe is computational in that sense .,technology
but i do not know because we are betting against we are betting against the universe to speak and i did not it is not when i spend a lot of my life building technology and then i know whats in there ?,technology
and it is there may be you may have unexpected behavior at my above thing that but fundamentally i know whats in there for the universe i am not in that position to speak .,technology
what computation do you think the fundamental law of physic might emerge from ?,technology
to clarify there youve done a lot of fascinating work with discrete kind of computation that you can sell your automaton and well talk about it .,technology
have this very clean structure it is such a nice way to demonstrate that simple rule can create immense complexity .,technology
but what is that are cellular automaton sufficiently general to describe the kind of computation that might create the law of physic ?,technology
to give a sense of what computation do you think would create ?,technology
we got to have the basis to speak .,technology
we have what to have the language in effect for describing computation for that to be feasible .,technology
the thing that ive been interested in for a long time is what are the most structuralist structure that we can create with computation ?,technology
thats a very specific very rigid thing .,technology
and ive been for a long time interested in what are the most structuralist structure that we can set up ?,technology
and what i had thought about for age is using graph network where essentially there a thought about space for example .,technology
what is space ?,technology
is a a question where i might ask back in the early day of quantum mechanic for example people said for sure space is going to be discrete because all these other thing we are finding are discrete but that never worked out in physic .,technology
and space in physic today is always treated a this continuous thing you could imagine it .,technology
the very first thing you could say is in his common notion is a point is something which ha no part .,technology
in other word there are there are point that are arbitrarily small and there a continuum of possible position of point .,technology
and the question is is that true ?,technology
and for example if we look at i do not know fluid air or water we might say it is a continuous fluid .,technology
we can pour it .,technology
we can do all kind of thing continuously .,technology
but we know because we know the physic of it that it consists of a bunch of discrete molecule bouncing around and only in the aggregate is it behaving a continuum .,technology
and the possibility exists that thats true of space too .,technology
people havent managed to make that work with existing framework and physic .,technology
but ive been interested in whether one can imagine that underneath space and also underneath time is something more structuralist .,technology
and the question is is it computational ?,technology
there are a couple possibility .,technology
it could be computational somehow fundamentally equivalent to a term machine .,technology
or it could be fundamentally not .,technology
how could it not be ?,technology
it could not be .,technology
a term machine essentially deal with integer whole number some level .,technology
and it can do thing it can add one to a number .,technology
it can do thing this .,technology
it can also store whatever the heck it did .,technology
yes it ha an infinite storage .,technology
but what term one one think about doing physic or idealized physic or idealized mathematics one can deal with real number number with an infinite number of digit .,technology
the number which are absolutely precise and we can say we can take this number and we can multiply it by itself .,technology
are you comfortable with infinity ?,technology
is it context ?,technology
are you comfortable in the context of computation ?,technology
do you think infinity play a part ?,technology
i think that the role infinity is complicated .,technology
and infinity is useful in conceptualizing thing .,technology
it is not actualizable .,technology
almost by definition it is not actualizable .,technology
but do you think infinity is part of the thing that might underlie the law of physic ?,technology
i think that no i think there are many question that you ask about .,technology
you might ask about physic which inevitably involve infinity .,technology
when you say is faster than a light travel possible ?,technology
you could say given the law of physic can you make something even arbitrarily large even quote infinitely large that will make faster than light travel possible ?,technology
then you are throwing into dealing with infinity a a theoretical question .,technology
but talking about whats underneath space and time and what how one can make a computational infrastructure ?,technology
one possibility is that you can not make a computational infrastructure and during such machine sense that you have to be dealing with precise real number you are dealing with partial differential equation which have precise real number that arbitrarily close to separated point .,technology
you have a continuum for everything .,technology
could be that thats what happens .,technology
that there a continuum for everything in precise real number for everything and then the thing i am thinking about are wrong .,technology
thats the risk you take if you are trying to do thing about nature is you might be wrong .,technology
it is not it is for me personally it is a strange thing thatve spent a lot of my life building technology where you can do something that nobody care about but you can not be wrong in that sense .,technology
in the sense you build your technology and it doe what it doe .,technology
you do not get to if the model for the universe is simple you do not get to have a line of code for each of those thing .,technology
you do not get to have the muon case the taulepton case all of those are all have to be emergent some something deeper .,technology
that mean it is inevitable thats a little hard to talk about what the underlying structural structure is .,technology
do you think human being have the cognitive capacity to understand if we are to discover to understand the kind of simple structure from which these law can emerge ?,technology
you think thats a good question .,technology
here what i think .,technology
i think that i am in the middle of this now .,technology
i am telling you that i think you are seeing this human this human ha a hard time understanding a bunch of the thing that are going on .,technology
but but what happens in understanding is one build waypoints .,technology
if you said understand modern 21st century mathematics starting from counting back and whenever counting wa invented fiftyzero year ago whatever it wa ?,technology
that will be difficult .,technology
but what happens is we build waypoints that allow u to get to higher level of understanding .,technology
and we see the same thing happening in language when we invent a word for something it provides a cognitive anchor a a waypoint that let u a podcast or something .,technology
you could be explaining it is a thing which this work this way that way .,technology
they are the way but a soon a you have the word podcast and people society understand it you start to build a build on top of that .,technology
and i think and thats the story of science too .,technology
science is about building these waypoints where we find this cognitive mechanism for understanding something .,technology
let me can build on top of it we have the idea of i do not know differential equation .,technology
we can build on top of that .,technology
we have the side area of that idea .,technology
my hope is that if it is the case that we have to go all the way from the sand to the computer and there no waypoints in between then we are toast .,technology
we will not be able to do that .,technology
eventually we might .,technology
if we are a clevver yap are good enough a billionaire abstract abstraction eventually from sand will get to the computer a. and it is might be a longer journey .,technology
the question is whether it is something that you ask whether our human is going on .,technology
and well quote understand whats going on .,technology
and thats a different question because for that it requires step that are for whether it is from which we can construct a human understandable narrative .,technology
and thats something that i think i am somewhat hopeful that that will be possible although a of today if you ask me i am confronted with thing that i do not understand very .,technology
and this is a small pattern in a computation trying to understand the rule under which the computation function .,technology
and it is the interesting possibility under which kind of computation such a creature can understand itself .,technology
my guess is that within we did not talk much about computational irreducibility but it is a consequence of this principle of computational equivalence .,technology
and it is a core idea that one ha to understand i think which is question is you are doing a computation you can figure out what happens in the computation by running every step in the computation and seeing what happens .,technology
or you can say let me jump ahead and figure out have something smarter that figure out whats going to happen before it happens .,technology
and a lot of traditional science ha been about that act of computational reducibility .,technology
it is weve got these equation and we can solve them .,technology
and we can figure out whats going to happen .,technology
we do not have to trace all of those step .,technology
we jump ahead because we solve these equation .,technology
one of the thing that is a consequence of the principle of computational equivalence is you do not always get to do that .,technology
many many system will be computationally irreducible .,technology
in the sense that the only way to find out what they do is follow each step and see what happens .,technology
why is that ?,technology
if you have if you are saying we with our brain we are a lot smarter we do not have to mess around the little cellular automaton going through and updating all those cell .,technology
we can use the power of our brain to jump ahead .,technology
but if the principle of computational equivalence is thats not going to be correct because it mean that there u doing our computation in our brain .,technology
there a little cellular automaton doing it computation .,technology
and the principle of computational equivalence say these two computation are fundamentally equivalent .,technology
that mean we do not get to say we are a lot smarter than the cellular automaton and jump ahead because we are doing computation thats of the same sophistication a the cellular automaton itself .,technology
thats computational irreducibility is fascinating .,technology
and thats a powerful idea .,technology
i think thats both depressing and humbling and on that while we and cellular automaton are the same .,technology
but the question we are talking about the fundamental law of physic is the reverse question .,technology
you are not predicting whats going to happen .,technology
you have to run the universe for that .,technology
but saying can i understand what rule likely generated me ?,technology
but the problem is to know whether you are you have to have some computational reducibility because we are embedded in the universe .,technology
if the only way to know whether we get the universe is to run the universe we do not get to do that because it ran for fourteen.six billion year or whatever .,technology
and we do not we can not rerun it to speak .,technology
we have to hope that there are pocket of computational reducibility sufficient to be able to say yes i can recognize those are electron there .,technology
and i think that it is a feature of computational irreducibility .,technology
it is a mathematical feature that there are always an infinite collection of pocket of reducibility .,technology
the question of whether they land in the place and whether we can build a theory based on them is unclear .,technology
but to this point about whether we a observer in the universe built out of the same stuff a the universe can figure out the universe to speak .,technology
that relies on these pocket of reducibility .,technology
without the pocket of reducibility it is will not work can not work .,technology
but i think this question about how observer operate .,technology
it is one of the feature of science over the last one hundred year particularly ha been that every time we get more realistic about observer we learn a bit more about science .,technology
for example relativity wa all about observer do not get to say when whats simultaneous with what they have to wait for the light signal to arrive to decide whats simultaneous .,technology
or for example in thermodynamics observer do not get to say the position of every single molecule and a gas .,technology
they can only see the large scale feature .,technology
and thats why the second level of thermodynamics loreventry being increased and on work .,technology
if you could see every individual molecule you wouldnt conclude something about thermodynamics .,technology
you would conclude these molecule all doing these particular thing .,technology
you wouldnt be able to see this aggregate fact .,technology
i strongly expect that and in fact the theory that i have the one ha to be more realistic about the computation and other aspect of observer in order to make a correspondence between what we experience in fact .,technology
they have a my little team and i have a little theory now about how quantum mechanic may work which is a very wonderfully bizarre idea about how threat of human consciousness relates to what we observe in the universe .,technology
but this is the several step to explain what thats about .,technology
what do you make of the mess of the observer at the lower level of quantum mechanic ?,technology
the textbook definition with quantum mechanic say that there some there two world .,technology
one is the world that is and the other is thats observed .,technology
yeah what do you make sense of that ?,technology
i think the idea weve recently had might give away into this .,technology
and thats i do not know yet .,technology
i think thats a mess .,technology
the fact is there is a one of the thing thats interesting and when people look at these model that i started talking about thirty year ago now they say no that compost would be what about quantum mechanic ?,technology
you say tell me what is the essence of quantum mechanic ?,technology
what do you want me to be able to reproduce to know that ive got quantum mechanic speak ?,technology
and that question come up .,technology
we are not quite ready yet .,technology
and one of the question that ive been curious about is if i have five minute with a quantum computer how can i tell if it is a quantum computer or whether it is a simulator at the other end ?,technology
and turn out it is hard .,technology
it turn out there is not it is a lot of these question about what is intelligence whats life .,technology
it is a very task for quantum computer .,technology
and i think the simulation yes exactly .,technology
is it a simulation or is it a quantum computer ?,technology
it is the same a you all over again .,technology
but that term this whole issue about the mathematical structure of quantum mechanic and the completely separate thing that is our experience in which we think definite thing happen but a quantum account it doesnt say definite thing ever happen .,technology
quantum mechanic is all about the amplitude for different thing to happen .,technology
but yet our threat of consciousness operates a if definite thing are happening .,technology
to linger on the point youve mentioned the structure that could underlie everything and this idea that it could perhaps have something the structure of a graph .,technology
you elaborate why your intuition is that there a graph structure of node and edge and what it might represent .,technology
. . the question is what is in a sense the most structural structure you can imagine .,technology
and in fact what ive recently realized in last year or i have a new most structuralist structure .,technology
by the way the question itself is a beautiful and a powerful one in itself .,technology
even without an answer the question is a strong question. . but whats your new idea ?,technology
it ha to do with hypergraphs .,technology
essentially what is interesting about the model i have now is a little bit what happened with computation .,technology
everything that i think of a maybe the model is this .,technology
and thats quite encouraging because it is i could say i am going to look at a trivalent graph with three edge for each node and on .,technology
i could look at this special graph .,technology
i could look at this algebraic structure and turn out that the thing i am now looking at everything that ive imagined that is a plausible type of structuralist structure is equivalent to this .,technology
what is it ?,technology
a typical way to think about it is you might have some collection of tuples collection of let say number .,technology
you might have one three five two three four .,technology
collection of number triple of number let say quadruple of number pair of number whatever .,technology
and you have all these floating little tuples they are not in any particular order .,technology
and that floating collection of tuples and i told you this wa abstract represents the whole universe .,technology
the only thing that relates them is when a symbol is the same it is the same to speak .,technology
if you have two tuples and they contain the same symbol let say at the same position of the tuple the first element of the tuple then that represents a relation .,technology
let me let me try and peel this back .,technology
wow i told you this abstract but this is this is the relationship is formed by the same some aspect of the sameness .,technology
but think about it in term of a graph .,technology
yeah a graph bunch of node let say you number each node .,technology
then what is a graph ?,technology
a graph is a set of pair that say this node ha an edge connecting it to this other node .,technology
thats the thats an graph is a collection of those pair that say this node connects to this other node .,technology
this is a generalization of that in which instead of having pair you have arbitrary end tuples .,technology
thats it thats the whole story .,technology
and now the question is that might represent the state of the universe how doe the universe evolve ?,technology
what doe the universe do ?,technology
and the answer is that what i am looking at is transformation rule on these hypergraphs .,technology
in other word you say this whenever a piece of this hypergraph that look this turn it into a piece of hypergraph that look this .,technology
on a graph it might be when the subgraph when this thing with a bunch of edge hanging out in this particular way then rewrite it a the subgraph. . and thats the whole story .,technology
the question is what now you say think that a i say this is quite abstract .,technology
and one of the question is where do you do those updating ?,technology
youve got this giant graph ?,technology
what trigger the updating ?,technology
whats the whats the ripple effect of it ?,technology
is it yeah and i suspect everythings discrete even in time ? .,technology
the question is what do you do the update ?,technology
and the answer is the rule is you do them wherever they apply .,technology
and you do them you do them the order in which the update is done is not defined .,technology
that is that you can do them .,technology
there may be many possible ordering for these update .,technology
now the point is if imagine you are an observer in the universe .,technology
and you say did something get updated ?,technology
you do not in any sense know until you yourself have been updated. . in fact all that you can be sensitive to is essentially the causal network of how an event over there affect an event thats in you .,technology
thats thats something else .,technology
you are part of the whole thing .,technology
thats your part of it .,technology
but even to have the the end result of that is all your sensitive to is this causal network of what event affect what other event .,technology
i am not making a big statement about the structure of the observer .,technology
i am simply saying i am simply making the argument that what happens the microscopic order of these rewrite is not something that any observer any conceivable observer in the universe can be affected by .,technology
because the only thing the observer can be affected by is this causal network of how the event in the observer are affected by other event that happen in the universe .,technology
the only thing you have to look at is the causal network .,technology
you do not have to look at this microscopic rewrite in the tapining .,technology
these rewrite are happening wherever they they have more wherever they feel .,technology
causal network is there .,technology
you said that there not the idea would be an undefined what get updated the sequence of thing is undefined .,technology
yes thats where you mean by the causal network .,technology
then the causal network is given that an update ha happened .,technology
thats an event .,technology
then the question is is that event cozzly related to doe that event if that event did not happen then some future event couldnt happen yet .,technology
you build up this network of what affect what. ?,technology
and what that doe when you build up that network thats the observable aspect of the universe in such sense .,technology
and then you can ask question about how robust is that observable aspect of whats happening in the universe ?,technology
here where it start getting interesting .,technology
for certain kind of microscopic rewriting rule the order of rewrite doe not matter to the causal network .,technology
and this is mathematical logic moment .,technology
this is equivalent to the church roster property of the confluence property of rewriting rule .,technology
and it is the same reason that if you are simplifying an algebraic expression for example you can say let me expand those term out .,technology
let me factor those piece .,technology
doesnt matter what order you do that in .,technology
youll always get the same answer .,technology
and thats it is the same fundamental phenomenon that cause for certain kind of microscopic rewriting rule the cause the causal network to be independent of the microscopic order of rewriting .,technology
why is that property important ?,technology
because it implies special relativity .,technology
the reason it is important is that that property special relativity say you can look at these different reference frame .,technology
you can have different you can be looking at your notion of what space and what time can be different depending on whether you are traveling at a certain speed depending on whether you are doing this that and the other .,technology
but nevertheless the law of physic are the same .,technology
thats what the principle of special relativity say .,technology
there law of physic are the same independent of your reference frame .,technology
turn out this change of the microscopic rewriting order is essentially equivalent to a change of reference frame or at least there a sub part of how that work thats equivalent to a change of reference frame .,technology
whats surprisingly and for the first time in forever it is possible for an underlying microscopic theory to implies special relativity to be able to derive it .,technology
it is not something you put in a a this is a it is something where this other property causal invariance which is also the property that implies that there a single thread of time in the universe .,technology
it might not be the case that that thats that is the thats what would lead to the possibility of an observer thinking that definite stuff happens .,technology
otherwise youve got all these possible rewriting order and who to say which one occurred .,technology
but with this causal invariance property there a notion of a definite thread of time .,technology
it sound that idea of time even space would be emergent from the system .,technology
no i am not a fundamental part of the fundamental level all youve got is a bunch of node connected by hyper edge or whatever .,technology
there no time there no space thats .,technology
but the thing is that it is imagining imagine you are dealing with a graph .,technology
and imagine you have something a honeycomb graph we have a hex a bunch of hexagon .,technology
that graph and a microscopic level it is a bunch of node connected to other node .,technology
but at a microscopic level you say that look a honeycomb it is lattice .,technology
it look a twodimensional manifold of some kind .,technology
it look a twodimensional thing .,technology
if you connect it differently if you connect all the node one one to another and a linked list type structure then youd say that look a onedimensional space .,technology
but at the microscopic level all these are network with node .,technology
the microscopic level they look something thats one of our familiar kind of space .,technology
and it is the same thing with these hypergraphs .,technology
now if you ask me have i found one that give me threedimensional space the answer is not yet .,technology
we do not know this is one of these thing we are betting against nature to speak .,technology
and i have no way to know .,technology
there are many other property of this system that have a very beautiful and very suggestive .,technology
and we are very elegant of this turn out to be because it is very it is very clean .,technology
you start with nothing and everything get built up .,technology
everything about space everything about time everything about matter .,technology
it is all emergent from the property of this extremely lowlevel system .,technology
and that will be pretty cool if thats the way our universe work .,technology
now do i on the other hand the thing that that i find very confusing is let say we succeed .,technology
let say we can say this particular hypergraphary writing rule give the universe .,technology
run that hypergraphary writing rule for enough time and youll get everything .,technology
youll get this conversation we are having .,technology
youll get everything .,technology
if we get to that point and we look at what is this thing ?,technology
what is this rule that we have that is giving u our whole universe ?,technology
how do we think about that thing ?,technology
let say turn out the minimal version of this and this is cool thing for a language designer me .,technology
the minimal version of this model is a single line of orphan language code .,technology
how doe that help you accept marbling in the beauty and the elegance of the simplicity that creates the universe ?,technology
that doe that help u predict anything ?,technology
not because of the irreducibility .,technology
thats correct .,technology
thats correct but the thing that ha strange to me and i havent wrapped my brain around this yet is one is one keep on realizing that we are not special .,technology
how do we come to get a simple universe when many of the available universe is to speak ?,technology
are incredibly complicated it might be a quintillion character long .,technology
why did we get one of the one thats simple ?,technology
and i havent wrapped my brain around that a soon yet .,technology
if indeed we are in such a simple the universe is such a simple rule a possible that there is something outside of this that we are in a what people call to the simulation ?,technology
there were part of a computation a being explored by a graduate student in alternate universe .,technology
the problem is we do not get to say much about whats outside of the universe because by definition how universe is what we exist with in .,technology
now can we make a almost theological conclusion from being able to know how our particular universe work ?,technology
i do not think that if you ask the question could we relate again to this question about the extraterrestrial intelligence ?,technology
weve got the rule for the universe .,technology
wa it built in on purpose ?,technology
thats the same thing a saying .,technology
we see a signal from that we are receiving from some random star somewhere .,technology
and it is a series of pulse .,technology
and it is a periodic series of pulse .,technology
let say wa that done on purpose ?,technology
can we conclude something about the origin of that series of pulse ?,technology
because it is elegant doe not necessarily mean that somebody created it or that we can even comprehend .,technology
i think it is the ultimate version of the identification of the techno signature question .,technology
the ultimate version of that is wa our universe a piece of technology to speak and how an earth will we know ?,technology
because but itll be it is in the crazy science fiction thing you could imagine you could say somebody going to have there going to be a signature there .,technology
it is going to be made by and .,technology
but there no way we could understand that to speak and it is not clear what that would mean .,technology
because the universe simply this if we find a rule for the universe we are not we are simply saying that rule represents what our universe doe .,technology
we are not saying that that rule is something running on a big computer and making our universe .,technology
it is saying that represents what our universe doe .,technology
and the same sense that law of classical mechanic differential equation whatever they are represent what mechanical system do .,technology
it is not that the mechanical system are somehow running solution to those differential equation .,technology
those differential equation represent in the behavior of those system .,technology
whats the gap in your sense to linger on the fascinating perhaps slightly scifi question ?,technology
whats the gap between understanding the fundamental rule that create universe and engineering a system creating a simulation ourselves ?,technology
youve talked about youve talked about nanoengineering idea that are exciting creating some idea of competition in the physical space .,technology
how hard it is is it a an engineering problem to create the universe once the rule that create it ?,technology
thats an interesting question .,technology
i think the substrate on which should the universe is operating is not a substrate that we have access to .,technology
the only substrate we have is that same substrate that the universe is operating in .,technology
if the universe is a bunch of hypergoss being rewritten then we get to attach ourselves to those same hypergoss being rewritten .,technology
we do not get to and if you ask the question is the code clean ?,technology
is can we write nice elegant code with the efficient algorithm and on ?,technology
thats an interesting question .,technology
how how thats this question of how much computational reduce the ability there is in the system .,technology
but ive seen some beautiful cellular automaton that create copy of itself within itself ?,technology
thats the question whether it is possible to create whether you need to understand the substrate or whether you can yeah .,technology
one of the thing that is one of my slightly scifi thought about the future to speak is now if you pull typical people who say do you think it is important to find the fundamental theory of physic ?,technology
you get because ive done this poll and formally at least it is curious .,technology
you got a decent fraction of people saying yeah that would be pretty interesting .,technology
i think thats becoming surprisingly enough more ive lived a lot of people are interested in physic in a way that with understanding it being scientist a very small number of them struggled to understand the nature of our reality .,technology
i think thats true and in fact in this project that i am launching into to try and find fundamental theory of physic i am going to do it a a very public project it is going to be livestreamed and all this stuff .,technology
i do not know what will happen itll be fun .,technology
i think that it is the interface to the world of this project .,technology
we are talking about the quest to find a fundamental theory of physic .,technology
first point is it is turned out it is hard to find the fundamental theory of physic .,technology
people will not show that that would be the case .,technology
back in the early day of applying mathematics to science 1600s and on people were and one hundred year will know everything there is to know about how the universe work .,technology
turn that to be harder than that .,technology
and people got humble at some level because every time we got to a greater level of smallness and studying the universe it seemed the math got more complicated and everything got harder .,technology
the when i when i wa a kid i started doing particle physic and when i wa doing particle physic i always thought finding the fundamental fundamental theory of physic thats a cookie business will never be able to do that .,technology
but we can operate within these framework that we built for doing quantum field theory and general relativity and thing this and it is all good and we can figure out a lot of stuff .,technology
did you even at that time have a sense that there something behind that ?,technology
i did not expect that i thought in some rather un it is crazy in thinking back on it because it is there wa this long period in civilization where people thought the ancient said it all figured out and well never figure out anything new .,technology
and to some extent thats the way i felt about physic when i wa in the middle of doing it to speak .,technology
wa weve got a quantum field theory it is the foundation of what we are doing and there yes there probably something underneath this but well never figure it out .,technology
but then i started studying simple program and the computational universe thing cellular automator and on and i discovered that there they do all kind of thing that were completely at odds with the intuition that i had had .,technology
and after that after this tiny little program that doe all this amazingly complicated stuff then you start feeling a bit more ambitious about physic and saying maybe we could do this for physic too .,technology
and thats that got me started year ago now in this idea of could we find whats underneath all of these framework quantum field theory and genre or evidence on .,technology
and people perhaps do not realize a close a they might that the framework we are using for physic which is these two thing quantum field theory the theory of small stuff and genre of levitation and large stuff .,technology
those are the two basic theory and there are one hundred year old .,technology
genre of levity wa one thousand nine hundred and fifteen quantum field theory 1920s one hundred year old .,technology
and theyve theyve it is been a good run .,technology
there a lot of stuff been figured out .,technology
but whats interesting is the foundation havent changed in all that period of time .,technology
even though the foundation had changed several time before that in the two hundred year earlier than that .,technology
and i think the kind of thing that i am thinking about which is informed by thinking about computation and the computational universe it is a different foundation .,technology
it is a different set of foundation and might be wrong .,technology
but it is at least we have a shot .,technology
and i think it is to me it is my personal calculation for myself is is if it turn out that the finding the fundamental theory of physic it is low hanging fruit to speak .,technology
itd be a shame if we did not think to do it .,technology
if people said youll never figure that stuff out .,technology
let and it take another two hundred year before anybody get around to doing it .,technology
i think it is i do not know how low hanging this fruit is .,technology
it may be it may be that it is the wrong century to do this project .,technology
i think the the cautionary tale for me i think about thing that ive tried to do in technology where people thought about doing them a lot earlier .,technology
my favorite example is probably livenets who who thought about making essentially encapsulating the world knowledge and a computational form in the late 1600s and did a lot of thing towards that .,technology
and we finally managed to do this but he wa three hundred year too early .,technology
and thats the thats the in term of life planning it is avoid thing that can not be done in your in your century to speak .,technology
yeah timing timing is everything .,technology
you think if we figure out the underlying rule it can create from which quantum field theory in general relativity can emerge do you think theyll help u unify it at that level of abstract ?,technology
i will know it completely .,technology
well know how that will fit together .,technology
yes without a question .,technology
and it is already even the thing ive already done there are very it is very very elegant .,technology
how thing seem to be fitting together now is it ?,technology
i do not know yet .,technology
it is awfully suggestive .,technology
if it is not it is some then the designer of the universe should feel embarrassed to speak because it is a good way to do that .,technology
in your intuition in term of design universe doe god play dice is there is there randomness in this thing or is it deterministic ?,technology
the thats a little bit of a complicated question because when you are dealing with these thing that involve these rewrite that have youve been randomness is an emergent phenomenon perhaps .,technology
it is a yeah randomness in many of these system pseudorandomness and randomness a halt to distinguish .,technology
in this particular case the current idea that we have about some measurement and quantum mechanic is something very bizarre and very abstract and i do not think i can yet explain it without yacking about very technical thing .,technology
eventually i will be able to but if thats if thats it is a it is a weird thing because it is slice between determinism and randomness in a weird way that hasnt been sliced before to speak .,technology
many of these question that come up in science where it is is it this or is it that turn out the real answer is it is neither of those thing it is something different and orthogonal to those those those category .,technology
and thats the current this week idea about how that might work but well well see how that unfolds .,technology
it is difficult in an old field to go back to the foundation and we are think about rewriting them .,technology
it is a lot easier in young field where you are still dealing with the first generation of people who invented the field .,technology
and then in your career and some of the thing youve taken on it feel you are not you havent been afraid of the hard slog .,technology
yeah it is true .,technology
it is it is quite interesting especially on the engineering side and a small tangent when you were a caltech did you get to interact with richard fimer and all you have any of you ?,technology
yeah i am very sure .,technology
we work together quite a bit .,technology
in fact on and in fact both when i wa at caltech and after i left caltech we were both consultant at this company called thinking machine corporation which wa down the street from here .,technology
a ultimately illfated company but i used to say this company is not going to work with the strategy they have and dick fimer always used to say what do we know about running company let them run their company ?,technology
but anyway it wa not into into that thing .,technology
and he always thought that my interest in doing thing running company wa a distraction to speak .,technology
and for me it is a mechanism to have a more effective machine for getting thing figuring thing out and getting thing to happen .,technology
did he think of it ?,technology
because essentially what you used you did with the company i do not know if you were thinking of it that way but you are creating tool to empower your to empower the exploration of the university .,technology
do you think do he that he understands that point ?,technology
that point of tool of i think not a a he might have done .,technology
i think that but he wa my first company which wa also involved with wa involved with more mathematical computation kind of thing .,technology
he wa quite he had lot of advice about the technical side of what we should do and on .,technology
give example of memory of thought .,technology
yeah yeah he had all kind of look in the business of doing one of the hard thing in math is doing integral and on ?,technology
and he had his own elaborate way to do integral and on he had his own way of thinking about getting intuition about how math work .,technology
and his meta idea wa take those intuition or method and make a computer follow those intuition or method .,technology
now it turn out for the most part when we do integral and thing what we do is is we build this bizarre industrial machine that turn every integral into product of mere g function and generates this very elaborate thing .,technology
and the big problem is turning the result into something a human will understand .,technology
it is not quite doing the integral .,technology
turn out the way weve done it is very different from that way .,technology
what do you make of that difference between ?,technology
wouldnt tell everybody about the complicated calculation because he thought that wa easy .,technology
he thought the impressive thing wa to have this simple intuition about how everything work .,technology
he invented that at the end and because hed done this calculation and knew how it worked it wa a lot easier it is a lot easier to have good intuition when what the answer is .,technology
id say i do not understand this i do something with a computer and hed say i do not understand this .,technology
piece of big argument about what wa what wa going on but it wa always some and i think many of the thing that we realized about quantum computing that wa issue that have to do particularly with the measurement process are still issue today .,technology
and i find it interesting it is a funny thing in science that these there a remarkable happens in technology too there a remarkable repetition of history that end up occurring .,technology
eventually thing get nailed down but it often take a while and it often thing come back decade later .,technology
for example i could tell a story happened down the street from here .,technology
when we were both at thinking machine i had been working on this particular cellulautomotom called rule thirty that ha this feature that it from very simple initial condition it make complicated behavior .,technology
print this out lot of very tiny cell and there wa a question of how some feature of that pattern and it wa very much a physical on the floor with meter rule trying to measure different thing .,technology
a feynman take me aside weve been doing that for a while and take me aside and he say i want to know this one thing .,technology
he say i want to know how did that this rule thirty thing would produce all this complicated behavior that is complicated that we are going around with this big printout and on ?,technology
and i said i did not know .,technology
i enumerated all the possible rule and then observed that thats what happened is that i feel a lot better .,technology
i thought you had some intuition that he did not have that would let one i said no no no no intuition experimental science .,technology
thats such a beautiful dichotomy there of thats exactly you show is you can not have an intuition about it and you are reduce you will you have to run u . yes thats .,technology
thats all hard for our human and especially brilliant physicist feynman to say that you can not have a compressed clean intuition about how the whole thing work .,technology
yes he wa i think he wa on the edge of understanding that point about computation and i think he found that that he always found computation interesting and i think that wa what he wa a little bit poking at .,technology
that intuition the difficulty of discovering thing even you say you enumerate all the case and find one that doe something interesting ?,technology
sound very easy .,technology
turn out i missed it when i first saw it because i had an intuition that said it shouldnt be there .,technology
i had argument i am going to ignore that case because whatever .,technology
and how did you have an open mind enough because you are essentially the same person a your fact the same physic type of thinking how did you find yourself having a sufficiently open mind to be open to watching rule and them revealing complexity ?,technology
yeah i think this interesting question .,technology
ive wondered about that myself because it is you live through these thing and then you say what wa the historical story ?,technology
and sometimes the historical story that you realize after the fact wa not what you lived through to speak .,technology
and what i realized is i think what happened is i did physic reductionistic physic where you are throwing the universe and you are told go figure out whats going on inside it .,technology
and then i started building computer tool and i started building my first computer language for example .,technology
and a computer language is not it is physic in the sense that you have to take all those computation people want to do and drill down and find the primitive that they can all be made of .,technology
but then you do something is different because you are saying these are the primitive .,technology
now hopefully theyll be useful to people .,technology
let build up from there .,technology
you are essentially building an artificial universe in a sense where you make this language youve got these primitive you are building whatever you feel building .,technology
and thats and it wa interesting for me because from doing science where you are throwing the universe a the universe is to then being told you can make up any universe you want .,technology
and i think that experience of making a computer language which is essentially building your own universe to speak is thats the thats what gave me a somewhat different attitude towards what might be possible .,technology
it is let explore what can be done in these artificial universe rather than thinking the natural science way of let be constrained by how the universe is .,technology
but there something fundamentally different between a computer and a telescope .,technology
it yeah i am hoping that i can romanticize the notion but it is more general .,technology
it is more general .,technology
and it is it is i think this point about people say such and such a thing wa almost discovered at such and such a time .,technology
the the distance between the building the paradigm that allows you to understand stuff or allows one to be open to seeing whats going on .,technology
thats hard .,technology
and i think in ive been fortunate in my life that i spent a lot of my time building computational language .,technology
and thats an activity that in a sense work by having to create the other level of abstraction and be open to different kind of structure .,technology
what do you think is the role of ego in the history of math and science ?,technology
and more a book title something a new science youve accomplished a huge amount .,technology
and in fact somebody said that newton did not have an ego and i looked into it and he had a huge ego .,technology
yeah but from an outsider perspective some of said that you have a bit of an ego a . do it that way doe ego get in the way ?,technology
is it empowering ?,technology
is it both ?,technology
it is it is it is complicated .,technology
and thats a story .,technology
ive had look ive spent more than half my life ceo in your tech company .,technology
it may be that if ive been an academic for example i could have checked the ego put it on put it on a shelf somewhere and ignore it characteristic but you are reminded of it quite often in the context of running a company .,technology
thats what it is about .,technology
it is about leadership and leadership is intimately tied to ego .,technology
now what doe it mean ?,technology
what what is the for me ive been fortunate that i think i have reasonable intellectual confidence to speak .,technology
that is i i am one of these people who at this point if somebody tell me something down under standard my conclusion is not that mean i am dumb that my conclusion is there something wrong with what i am being told .,technology
and that wa a bit fun and you used to have that that feature too he never believed in .,technology
he believed in expert much le than i believe in expert .,technology
the result of i am pretty sure i am and turn out i am not .,technology
how am i going to be able to do this ?,technology
and i wa fortunate in the sense that i happened to start having some degree of success in science and thing when i wa young and that developed a certain amount of intellectual confidence i do not think i otherwise would have had .,technology
in the reason i i immediately understood the ego behind and you science .,technology
to me try to express my feeling and the whole thing is that if you do not allow that ego then you would never write that book that you would say people must have done this .,technology
and i think that wa i think you have to take that ego and ride it and see where it take you .,technology
and thats how you create exceptional work .,technology
but i think the other point about that book wa it wa a nontrivial question how to take a bunch of idea that i think reasonably big idea they might their importance is determined by what happens historically .,technology
when can not tell how important they are one can tell the scope of them .,technology
and the scope is fairly big .,technology
and they are very different from thing that have come before .,technology
and the question is how do you explain that stuff to people ?,technology
and i had had the experience of saying there are these thing there a seller a tomaton it doe this it doe that .,technology
and people are it must be this .,technology
it must be that .,technology
it is not .,technology
it is something different .,technology
you could have done i am glad you did what you did but you could have done academically you published keep publishing small paper here and there .,technology
and then you would keep getting this resistance ?,technology
you would get it is supposed to drop a thing that say here it is .,technology
here the full thing .,technology
no that wa my calculation .,technology
it is you could introduce little piece thats one possibility is it is the secret weapon to speak .,technology
it is this i keep on discovering these thing and all these different area where they come from .,technology
but i decided that in the interest of one only ha one life to lead them the writing that book took me a decade .,technology
anyway it is not there not a lot of wiggle room to speak one can not be wrong by a factor of three .,technology
you talk about ego and it is for example i run a company which ha my name on it ?,technology
i thought about starting a club for people who company have their name on them .,technology
it is it is a funny group because we are not a bunch of ego maniac .,technology
thats not what it is about to speak .,technology
it is about taking responsibility for what one doing .,technology
i also happen to be a pretty strong leader of it but showing a deep inextricable investment the same your name steve job name wasnt on on on apple but he wa apple .,technology
he lost .,technology
he lost .,technology
his name is not on tesla but he is tesla .,technology
it is meaning emotionally it is it is it is company successor fails .,technology
he would that emotionally he would suffer through that .,technology
and thats thats thats a good recognizing that fact tonight .,technology
and also wolfram is a pretty good branding name that it work out .,technology
yeah id to exactly .,technology
steve had it how to how to how to deal that .,technology
yeah you you made up for it with the last name. . in two thousand and two you published a new science to which on a personal level i can credit my love for cellular tom and computation in general .,technology
i think a lot of others can a . can you briefly describe the vision the hope the main idea presented in this twelvehundredpage book ?,technology
although it took one thousand two hundred page to say in the book .,technology
no the the real idea it is a good way to get into it is to look at the arc of history and to look at whats happened in the development of science .,technology
there wa this big idea in science about three hundred year ago that wa let use mathematical equation to try and describe thing in the world .,technology
let use the formal idea of mathematical equation to describe what might be happening in the world rather than for example using logical augmentation and on .,technology
let have a formal theory about that .,technology
and thereve been this three hundredyear run of using mathematical equation to describe the natural world which will work pretty .,technology
but i got interested in how i could generalize that notion .,technology
there is a formal theory .,technology
but what structure could those rule have .,technology
and what i got interested in wa let generalize beyond the purely mathematical rule .,technology
and we now have this notion of programming and computing and on .,technology
let use the kind of rule that can be embodied in program to a a generalization of the one that can exist in mathematics a a way to describe the world .,technology
and my favorite version of these kind of simple rule are these thing called cellular automaton and typical case shall wait .,technology
what are cellular automaton ?,technology
fair enough .,technology
typical case of a cellular automaton .,technology
it is an array of cell .,technology
it is a line of discrete cell .,technology
each cell is either black or white .,technology
and in a series of step you can represent a line going down a page .,technology
you are updating the color of each cell according to a rule that depends on the color of the cell above it and to it left and .,technology
it is simple .,technology
a thing might be if the cell and it neighbor are not the same and or the cell on the left is black or something then make it black on the next step and if not make it white .,technology
that rule i am not sure i said it exactly but a rule very much what i said ha the feature that if you start it off from one black cell at the top .,technology
it make this extremely complicated pattern .,technology
some rule you get a very simple pattern .,technology
some rule you have the rule a simple .,technology
you start them off from a simple seed .,technology
you get this very simple pattern .,technology
but other rule and this wa the big surprise when i started doing the simple computer experiment to find out what happens is that they produce very complicated pattern of behavior .,technology
for example this rule thirty rule ha the feature you start it from one black cell at the top .,technology
make this very random pattern .,technology
if you look at the center column of cell you get a series of value it go black white black black whatever it is .,technology
that sequence seems for all practical purpose random .,technology
it is in math you compute the digit of pi three.one million four hundred and fifteen thousand nine hundred and twenty six whatever .,technology
those digit once computed the scheme for computing pi it is the ratio of this conference in amateur of a circle very defined but yet when you are once youve generated those digit they seem for all practical purpose completely random .,technology
and it is with rule thirty .,technology
that even though the rule is very simple much simpler much more computationally obvious than the rule for generation digit of pi even with a rule that simple you are still generating immensely complicated behavior .,technology
yeah if we could pause on that i think you probably said it and looked at it long you forgot the magic of it or perhaps you do not you still feel the magic .,technology
but to me if youve never seen i would say what is it ?,technology
a onedimensional essentially another time ?,technology
and you were to guess what you would see if you have some cell that only respond to it neighbors. ?,technology
if you were to guess what thing you would see my initial guess even when i first open your book and you said it is ?,technology
my initial guess is you would see it would be a very simple stuff .,technology
and i think it is a magical experience to realize the complex you mentioned rule thirty still your favorite cellular atomic atomic all my favorite rule yes .,technology
you get complexity immense complexity .,technology
you get arbitrary complexity .,technology
and when you say randomness down the middle column thats one cool way to say that there incredible complexity .,technology
and thats thats a magical idea .,technology
however you start to interpret it all the reproducibility discussion all that .,technology
but it is i think that ha profound philosophical notion around the two .,technology
it is not no it is transformational about how the world .,technology
i think for me it wa transformational .,technology
for some reason it is a deeply profound notion at least .,technology
i find it that way .,technology
yeah look it is been it wa a very intuitionbreaking thing to discover .,technology
it is you point the computational telescope out there and suddenly i do not know in the past it is moon of jupiter or something .,technology
but suddenly something thats very unexpected and rule thirty wa very unexpected for me .,technology
and the big challenge at a personal level wa to not ignore it .,technology
people in other word you might say it is a bug .,technology
what would you say yeah what would you say ?,technology
yeah what are we looking at by the way ?,technology
i wa generating here ill generate a rule thirty pattern .,technology
thats the rule for rule thirty and it say for example it say here if you have a black cell in the middle and black cell to the left and white cell to the and the cell on the next step will be white .,technology
and here the actual pattern that you get starting off from a single black cell at the top there .,technology
and then thats the initial state initial condition .,technology
thats the initial thing .,technology
you start off from that and then you are going down the page and every at every step you are applying this rule to find out the new value that you get .,technology
and you might think rule that simple you got to get some trace of that simplicity here .,technology
well run it let say for four hundred step .,technology
what it doe it is aliasing a bit on the screen there but you can see there a little bit of regularity over on the left but there a lot of stuff here that look very complicated very random .,technology
and thats a big shock to it wa a big shock to my intuition at least that thats possible .,technology
the amount immediately start is there a pattern and there must be a repair to a pattern .,technology
yeah it must be a pattern .,technology
i spent indeed thats what i thought at first .,technology
and i thought i thought this is interesting but if we run it long enough well see something will resolve into something simple .,technology
and i did all kind of analysis of using mathematics statistic cryptography whatever to try and crack it .,technology
and i never succeeded .,technology
and after i hadnt succeeded for a while i started thinking maybe there a real phenomenon here that is the reason i am not succeeded .,technology
maybe the thing that for me wa a motivating factor wa looking at the natural world and seeing all this complexity that exists in the natural world the question were doe it come from ?,technology
if we look at the newton apple wa there wa there you took a walk and something it profoundly hit you or wa it a gradual thing allows me to think that there truth the truth of every science discovery is it is not that gradual .,technology
ive spent i happen to be interested in scientific biography kind of thing and ive tried to track down how do people come to figure out this or that thing ?,technology
and there always a long preparatory there a need to be prepared in a mindset in which it is possible to see something .,technology
in the case of rule thirty i rose around june one one thousand nine hundred and eighty four wa some a silly story in some way .,technology
i finally had a highresolution laser printer .,technology
i thought thats a possible thing .,technology
i did not know if it is correct .,technology
still i am not sure that it is correct but it is a gradual thing that these thing gradually become seem more important than one thought .,technology
i think the whole idea of studying the computational universe of simple program it took me probably a decade a decade and a half to internalize that that wa an important idea .,technology
and i think if it turn out we find the whole universe looking out there in the computational universe thats a good it is a good bounty point to something for the for the whole idea .,technology
but i think that the the thing thats strange in this whole question about finding this different raw material for making model of thing .,technology
whats been interesting in the in arc of history is for three hundred year it is the mathematical equation approach .,technology
it wa the winner .,technology
it wa the thing you want to have a good model for something thats what you use .,technology
the thing thats been remarkable is in the last decade or i think one can see a transition to using not mathematical equation but program a the raw material for making model of stuff .,technology
and thats pretty neat .,technology
and it is a somebody who lived inside this paradigm shift to speak it is bizarre .,technology
no doubt in the history of science that will be seen a an instantaneous paradigm shift .,technology
but it sure is not instantaneous when it is played out in one actual life to speak ?,technology
and i think thats been watching that process ha been interesting .,technology
i am i am i think i am fortunate that ive i do stuff mainly because i doing it .,technology
and if i wa that make me thickskinned about the world response to what i do .,technology
and but thats definitely in any time you write a book called something a new science it is the pitchfork will come out for the old science .,technology
and i wa it wa interesting dynamic .,technology
i think that the i have to say that i wa fully aware of the fact that the when inscipient paradigm shift in science the bigger of the negative response upon early introduction is a fantastic positive indicator of good longterm result .,technology
in other word if people do not care it is thats not such a good sign .,technology
if they are this is great .,technology
that mean you did not discover anything interesting .,technology
what fascinating property of rule thirty have you discovered over the year ?,technology
youve recently announced the rule thirty prize for solving three key problem .,technology
can you maybe talk about interesting property that have been revealed rule thirty or other cellular time ?,technology
and what problem are still before u the three problem youve announced ?,technology
the most interesting thing about cellular automaton is that it is hard to figure stuff out about them .,technology
and thats some in a sense every time you try and you try and bash them with some other technique you say can i crack them ?,technology
the answer is they seem to be uncrackable .,technology
they seem to have the feature that they are that they are showing irreducible computation .,technology
they are not you are not able to say i know exactly what this is going to do .,technology
it is going to do this or that .,technology
but there some specific formulation of that fact .,technology
for example in rule thirty in the pattern you get starting from a single black cell you get this very very random looking pattern .,technology
and one feature of that look at the center column .,technology
and for example we use that for a long time to generate randomness in both language .,technology
what rule thirty produce .,technology
now the question is can you prove how random it is ?,technology
for example one very simple question can you prove it in the level of heat ?,technology
we havent been able to show that it will never repeat .,technology
we know that if there are two adjacent column we know they can not both repeat .,technology
but knowing whether that center column can ever repeat we still do not even know that .,technology
another problem that i put in my collection of it is thirtyzero for three for these three prize for about rule thirty i would say that this is not one of those this is one of those case where the money is not the main point .,technology
but it is help some motivate somehow that the investigation .,technology
there three problem you propose .,technology
you get thirtyzero if you solve all three or maybe yeah .,technology
no it is tenzero for each. . my the problem is thats .,technology
money is not the thing .,technology
the problem is it is clean the formulation is well never become periodic .,technology
second problem is are there an equal number of black and white cell down the middle column ?,technology
down the middle column .,technology
and the third problem is a little bit harder to state which is essentially is there a way of figuring out what the color of a cell at position t down the center column is in a with a le computational effort than about t step .,technology
is there a way to jump ahead and say i know what this is going to do .,technology
it is some mathematical function of t or proving that there is no way or proving there is no way .,technology
but both for any one of these one could prove that one could discover we know what rule thirty doe for billion step .,technology
but and maybe well know for trillion step before too very long .,technology
but maybe at a quadrillion step it suddenly becomes repetitive .,technology
you might say how could that possibly happen ?,technology
but when i wa writing up these prize i thought and this is typical of what happens in the computational universe i thought let me find an example where it look it is going to be random forever but it becomes repetitive .,technology
and i found one and it is i did a search i searched i do not know maybe a million different rule with some criterion .,technology
and this is whats interesting about that is i have this thing that i say in a silly way about the computational universe which is the animal are always smarter than you are .,technology
that is there always some way one of these computational system is going to figure out how to do something even though i can not imagine how it is going to do it .,technology
but whether equivalently yes marry .,technology
thats correct .,technology
and that make it that make one feel very it is humbling every time because every time the thing is you think it is going to do this .,technology
it is not going to be possible to do this and it turn out it find a way .,technology
of course the problem is think thing is there a lot of other rule rule thirty .,technology
it is rule thirty is always my favorite because i found it first and thats .,technology
but the problem are focusing on rule thirty is possible that rule thirty is is is repetitive after trillion step .,technology
and that doesnt prove anything about the other rule .,technology
it doe not but this is a good experiment of how you go about trying to prove something about it .,technology
yes take the rule .,technology
and it also all these thing helped build intuition .,technology
that is exactly .,technology
if it turned out that this wa repetitive after trillion step thats not what i would expect .,technology
and we learned something from that .,technology
the method to do that though would reveal something interesting about the no doubt .,technology
it is although it is sometimes challenging the i put out a prize in two thousand and seven for for a particular touring machine that i there wa the simplest candidate for being the universal touring machine .,technology
and the young chape in england named alex smith after a smallish number of month said ive got a proof and he did i took a little while to iterate but how to prove unfortunately the proof is very it is it is a lot of micro detail .,technology
it is it is not it is not you look at it and you say aha there a big new principle .,technology
the big new principle is the simplest touring machine that might have been universal is universal .,technology
and it is incredibly much simpler than the touring machine that people already knew were universal before that .,technology
and that intuitionally is important because it say competition universality is closer at hand than you might have thought .,technology
but the actual method are not in that particular case but not terribly luminous .,technology
it would be nice if the method would also be elegant .,technology
thats true .,technology
yeah no i think it is one of these thing where it is a lot of weve talked about earlier opening up ai and machine learning and thing of whats going on inside .,technology
and is it is it step by step or can you see the bigger picture of more abstractly ?,technology
and then fortunate with vermas last theorem proof it is unfortunate that the proof to such an elegant theorem is not it is not it doesnt write into the margin of a page .,technology
thats true .,technology
but one of the thing is thats another consequence of computational or irreducibility .,technology
this fact that there are even quite short result in mathematics whose proof are long .,technology
yes thats a thats a consequence of all the stuff .,technology
and it is it is a it make one wonder how come mathematics is possible at all ?,technology
why is why is it the case how people manage to navigate doing mathematics through looking at thing where they are not thrown into it is all understandable .,technology
thats thats it own own separate separate story .,technology
and that would be that would have a poetic beauty to it is if people were to find something interesting about rule thirty because there an emphasis to this particular role .,technology
it wouldnt say anything about the broad irreducibility of all computation but it would never last put a few smile on people face of yeah .,technology
but to me it is in a sense establishing principal computational equivalence it is a little bit doing inductive science anywhere .,technology
that is the more example you find the more convinced you are that it is generally true .,technology
we do not get to whenever we do natural science we we say it is true here that this or that happens can we can we prove that it is true everywhere in the universe ?,technology
no we can not .,technology
it is the same thing here .,technology
we are exploring the computational universe .,technology
we are establishing fact in the computational universe .,technology
and thats thats a way of of inductively concluding general thing .,technology
weve implied that discussion of physic underlying everything but we we talked about the potentially equivalent of the fundamental law of physic and the computation going on in tournament machine .,technology
but can you now connect that do you think there something special or interesting about the computation that our body do ?,technology
let talk about brain primarily .,technology
i think the most important thing about the thing that our brain do are that we care about them .,technology
in the sense that there a lot of computation going on out there in cellular tomaheter and physical system and on and it it doe what it doe .,technology
it follows those rule it doe what it doe .,technology
the thing thats special about the computation in our brain is that it is connected to our goal and our current whole societal story .,technology
i think thats the special feature .,technology
and now the question then is when this whole ocean of computation out there how do you connect that to the thing that we human care about ?,technology
in a sense a large part of my life ha been involved in the technology of how to do that .,technology
what ive been interested in is building computational language that allows that something that both we human can understand and that can be used to determine computation that are computation we care about .,technology
i think when you look at something one of these cellular automaton and it doe some complicated thing you say thats fun but why do i care ?,technology
you could say the same thing in physic .,technology
you say ive got this material and it is a ferrite or something .,technology
it is some ha some magnetic property .,technology
it is amusing but why do i care ?,technology
we end at caring because ferrite is whats used to make magnetic tape magnetic disk whatever or we could use the crystal .,technology
it is made used to make not that should increasingly not but it ha been used to make computer display and on .,technology
but those are in a sense we are mining these thing that happen to exist in the physical universe and i am making it be something that we care about because we entrain it into technology .,technology
and it is the same thing in the computational universe that a lot of whats out there is stuff thats happening but sometimes we have some objective and we will go and mine the computational universe for something thats useful for some particular objective .,technology
the thing that ive been excited about recently which i had only realized recently which is embarrassing but it is the the arc of what weve tried to do in building this computational language is it is a similar arc of what happened when mathematical notation wa invented .,technology
go back four hundred year people were trying to do math they were always explaining their math and word and it wa pretty conkey and a soon a mathematical notation wa invented you could start defining thing algebra and later calculus and on and all became much more streamlined .,technology
now we have a computational language which allows u to start talking about the world computationally and let u my view of it is it is computational x for all x all these different field of computational this computational that thats what we can now build .,technology
first of all the mundane what is wolf from language in term of i can answer the question for you but it is not the philosophical deep to profound the impact of it .,technology
i am talking about in term of tool in term of thing you can download and play with what is it what is it been into the infrastructure what are the different way to interact with it ?,technology
it is very there a symbolic yeah it is a symbolic language a symbolic language i do not know how to clean the express that but that make it very distinct from how we think about i do not know programming in a language python or something .,technology
loop which is weve done a lot of stuff natural language understanding using essentially not learning based method using a lot of out the logarithmic method human curation method and on i am people try to enter a query and then converting the process of converting n.l.u .,technology
hello and welcome to another podcast from odell technology .,technology
today we are very fortunate to be joined by the cofounder and ceo of upfront diagnostics .,technology
morning stephen .,technology
thank you much for having me at your podcast .,technology
odell i wa wondering if you could tell u a little bit about your background and how you ended up where you are today .,technology
yeah we started in two thousand and seventeen .,technology
my brother wa living in cambridge .,technology
he wa developing pointofcare device for one of the main manufacturer of lateral flow in the uk .,technology
and i wa studying marketing at the university in spain .,technology
and then yeah my brother had the idea of he wanted to create a company in diagnostics .,technology
and we found that there were no any stroke black test in the market .,technology
we thought that it wa a great market opportunity although it wa a massive challenge .,technology
but we decided to move to cambridge and we started up from diagnostics .,technology
and then we met the third cofounder dr. eduardo gauden who is a phd from the university .,technology
thats how we all started .,technology
but we had this idea of starting the company .,technology
we were in the climbing world in cambridge and thats how we met eduardo and thats how the company started six year ago .,technology
now tell me what doe the diagnostic do ?,technology
the problem with a stroke is that there are many different type .,technology
and each type of a stroke need to be treated at a specialized centre .,technology
for example in england there are only twenty four hospital that can deliver the specific neurosurgical procedure for a type of stroke known a large vessel occlusion which represents around a third of all stroke but they contribute to over ninety five of these ability and death .,technology
what we develop is a rapid test very very similar to the covid test .,technology
it take a few minute and paramedic bring this test with them and it help them to identify those large vessel occlusion on the spot and then redirect those patient to those specialized centre without having to go to a hospital without the specific treatment .,technology
and this save around one hundred minute to treatment which is the difference between life and death .,technology
it is personalized medicine is not it ?,technology
yeah yeah correct .,technology
it is what they call precision medicine .,technology
and you are also your streamlined and care pathway you are introducing cost efficiency .,technology
tell me have you got good case study of the system far ?,technology
yeah weve done different study .,technology
here in the uk we did a very large clinical trial in collaboration with newcastle university under an innovate uk grant .,technology
we tested more than three hundred patient and we achieved very very positive result .,technology
then we replicated the result in the u . we did a study in collaboration with the hospital in florida and we are publishing the result now in a few week .,technology
thats quite exciting .,technology
and currently we are testing the device in five hospital in the uk .,technology
we are testing the device in the northeast of england in newcastle northumbria and then we are also testing the device in london .,technology
there are emergency department today testing and using the device .,technology
thats fantastic .,technology
is it better that a paramedic ha the test or is it better that an emergency department ha the test ?,technology
it can be both but usually it is paramedic since thats where you can save more time to treatment .,technology
it is all about how long it take to the patient to ride to the centre .,technology
there is value for the test to be in the emergency department but the sooner you spot the stroke even at the home of the patient the sooner the patient will get to the specialised centre .,technology
it can be used in different stage of the stroke .,technology
now the company is based in cambridge in the uk correct ?,technology
yeah we are in the biomedical campus in cambridge very close to big company astrazeneca or upcom .,technology
we know it will .,technology
i think that what youve been able to achieve in a very short space of time is remarkable .,technology
the test itself is a point of care test it can be done in any setting .,technology
how long doe the test take to perform ?,technology
thank you stephen for that question .,technology
now the result we have is between ten and fifteen minute and thats the time to diagnose it .,technology
it can be lower sometimes but then fifteen minute is the maximum .,technology
thats fantastic .,technology
thats going to save somebody life .,technology
and then of course youve got different way of treating different stroke and thats the pathway you are talking about .,technology
i wasnt aware of twenty four hospital in the uk .,technology
thats fascinating .,technology
i do not think many people would be aware of that .,technology
in cambridge for example in all east anglia we only have adam brook cambridge who can treat lbo patient .,technology
in london we have a few more hospital but then the more you go up the le specialized center that you have .,technology
in place wale scotland there are many patient from wale and scotland that are transferred to england for receiving treatment .,technology
and the same problem happened in the u . in the u only three of hospital can give this specialized treatment .,technology
it is because there are not many specialized doctor that can deliver this type of treatment .,technology
and also you need to have very specialized equipment it is not widely spread .,technology
and the other problem is that there are no plan to increase the amount of those center .,technology
there is no plan from the nh to increase the amount of center that will deliver this treatment .,technology
the only way to improve the care is to have earlier diagnosis .,technology
thats the only way. . now the company received some funding over the last several year .,technology
can you tell me something about the funding ?,technology
yeah in total weve received around three and a half million pound .,technology
we have secured a very large uk grant a few year ago .,technology
and then last year the nh and the stroke association and sbri provided u with a one.one million contract to implement this technology in the nh .,technology
and also we have institutional investor venture capital mainly the university of cambridge and apex venture which is a very known vc in bayesian austria that work in metec .,technology
apex venture is quite an interesting company .,technology
now is there something youd to talk about in particular ?,technology
i think that a bit of how we got here no ?,technology
i think that for u it wa very important to involve clinician from the beginning .,technology
you think that healthcare startup need to work with professional clinician from the beginning .,technology
and that wa part of our journey .,technology
before we start any development and any research we started working with the team in newcastle university .,technology
and we asked them no lie what do you want ?,technology
which type of tool will help you to give a better care to patient ?,technology
and they told u that we are starting to have this problem with stroke patient .,technology
it will be fantastic to have a tool that could tell u in the ambulance what type of stroke is the patient suffering ?,technology
i think something that we learned from experience is that talking to doctor doesnt cost money .,technology
you do not need to raise any investment to do that .,technology
and i think thats a very important part because when you start development you can not go backwards .,technology
when you start to do trial and to develop a device you need to know what you are doing .,technology
i think the sooner you start talking to professional clinician doctor nurse paramedic patient the le chance of doing something wrong you will have .,technology
involve the let say and this applies to any industry involve your customer since they won .,technology
and this doesnt cost any money .,technology
you do not need to raise million to do that .,technology
you need to spend the time and also be open to be challenged .,technology
i think that you need to have an open mind and do not try to have all the answer but try to ask the question .,technology
i think thats super important .,technology
what challenge have you encountered in the last several year while you are doing while you are setting up this business ?,technology
it is hard to mention all of them .,technology
i would say that in the first one is finding the market fit .,technology
there are many different type of test that you could develop .,technology
finding the one that wa going to make a difference wa hard because the one that were very clear that will make a difference were already developed .,technology
and then the one that were novel the client or the customer will not understand them .,technology
you need to pick something that wa very novel but at the same time no one wa doing it .,technology
i wa going to be accepted by the market .,technology
and then the second i think is fundraising especially during covid .,technology
there wa a moment during covid where we were in a bad situation because there wa no capital available for u . although there wa capital no there wa definitely people raising money but in our case we were stuck at our home .,technology
we were doing our clinical trial we did not have any data yet .,technology
and there wa a moment where it wa very hard to manage our cash flow .,technology
those two thing were the most difficult i think market fit and fundraising .,technology
but if you look at data thats the main two challenge that every startup ha .,technology
and those are the main two cause of company to disappear .,technology
market fit fundraising is always the no there are other problem but yeah .,technology
can you tell me something about the diagnostic accuracy or the diagnostic precision sensitivity specificity of the test ?,technology
yeah absolutely .,technology
we have published data in the public journal the data is publicly available .,technology
and we can share the detail afterwards for people to go and look at them .,technology
but the data weve achieved is a ninety five accuracy for identification of large basal occlusion with eighty six sensitivity ninety eight specificity .,technology
we are very good at finding the patient that have an lvo .,technology
when you transfer a patient to one of those specialized center you want to be almost sure that you have an lvo because it is not only the patient who is moving to a different hospital it is also the family of the patient .,technology
they need to do a longer travel .,technology
and there are many factor that will affect their life .,technology
you need to be very careful when you make those type of decision .,technology
tell me have you looked at the cost efficiency of this an exercise the health economic ?,technology
the weve done an exercise nh ha done an exercise for u and we could save four hundred and fortyzero pound for every one thousand patient that received the test .,technology
there is a huge cost saving .,technology
there are one hundred and fiftyzero new stroke every year .,technology
if you multiply the cost are around seventy to eighty million per year which is massive .,technology
and also you need to help them to continue with their life .,technology
obviously there is a massive direct cost saving that but also indirect .,technology
no absolutely .,technology
i think it ha a enormous budget impact effect on a lot of operation particularly integrated care system .,technology
is there anything else youd to mention ?,technology
i think that talking about venture capital in medtech which i think is different from other market in other industry especially software generating revenue at least is doable .,technology
while in our world let call it our bubble started to generate revenue it take a lot of time because you need to go through a very lengthy process .,technology
there are way of showing traction to those investor that you will make it but until you start generating revenue is a high risk for them .,technology
the problem that they have venture capital i think in this space is that if they do not if they invest too early they are taking a lot of risk and maybe they lose their money .,technology
but if they wait too long then those company start generating revenue they can start having deal with the strategic company the rush the adult the big company and that put them out of the scope .,technology
it is very hard for venture capital in medtech to make the decision because they need to balance the risk with missing an opportunity .,technology
i think it is a very different world from i think it happens also in life science not therapeutic but there is definitely a challenge for venture capital in medtech because there are too there are we are too many and it is hard to pick the one .,technology
but if you arrive too late then you do not have an opportunity to get a piece of the cake .,technology
i think that there is a challenge in venture capital in medtech that i think with all the university of cambridge incubator all these sign all these thing that are creating traction is reducing the risk for them .,technology
but anyway i think it is a it is a different type of investment .,technology
yeah i think that for u the challenge is how to prove that we are going to be the one making it .,technology
although there are there are thing that you can collect and you can show that that that will happen to say i think the upfront i think is the one .,technology
have you started generating revenue at this point in time ?,technology
we have secure contract with the nh .,technology
it is nonrecurrent revenue it is a oneoff payment .,technology
but we will start generating revenue very soon .,technology
we will start compensating probably early next year .,technology
yeah we are we are we are very close to get the approval and start revenue .,technology
yeah we are getting there .,technology
and where wa the kid manufactured ?,technology
shes manufactured in england .,technology
we are collaborating with a third party and they have a manufacturer inside with ninety employee .,technology
ive enjoyed talking to you today and i hope to talk to you again in another six month time .,technology
you are making a big difference .,technology
i havent got a problem with it a long a you do not come anywhere near me .,technology
probably one of the biggest thing in the last ten year .,technology
it wa absolute game changer .,technology
all the time .,technology
it is part of it .,technology
mate dale tell me about that .,technology
there nothing i wouldnt say to alies face .,technology
do you want to start by apologising for the sound on the last one ?,technology
candid are we rolling ?,technology
yeah we will apologise to everyone for the sound .,technology
whose fault wa it ?,technology
it wa not my fault .,technology
i wa talking to the mic the whole thing .,technology
it wa wilksie the man that wa in charge of the sound .,technology
he done it again .,technology
he done it again .,technology
he wasnt in charge very .,technology
thats whose fault it wa .,technology
we are going to try our best not to ruin the sound this time .,technology
here we are .,technology
no i wa ... we have got plan in place to slightly rejig the set up to make it visually more pleasing and a bit more comfortable looking .,technology
hopefully with that the new sound will be better anyway .,technology
yeah i think itd be good. . but the good thing is everyones enjoying them .,technology
shes obviously great .,technology
everyone seems to the concept .,technology
the uncut rawness of chatting away and putting it all out there no matter what get discussed .,technology
i think it is going to be a long liveem .,technology
hopefully they can carry on and ... yeah yeah of course .,technology
it sound good enough .,technology
more people might watch .,technology
weve got a ... i think we are going to touch on at the beginning some success that a couple of u have had recently fishing .,technology
you want to bring up your fishing do not you ?,technology
no i said we would because i had a good fishing trip last week one of our sponsored angler and spooners had a few carp in the last couple of week .,technology
we can talk about that .,technology
but then we are also going to get into a question thats been sent in .,technology
the one question i am hoping is going to be enough to last this podcast .,technology
i think it can spin off in load of different direction .,technology
i think perhaps well pas over to spooner and talk about what he been up to last week or .,technology
talk for a couple of your carp .,technology
yeah nice couple of trip .,technology
it wa up at norton disney with all of the salesman from across europe and the uk .,technology
it looked fun that .,technology
first time the european boy have been over to ... a lot of them to catch their first ever english carp and to come and see the quartertales .,technology
nice timing for one of my bite .,technology
id done the night the uk boy were turning up and theyve all rocked up in me swim .,technology
i am making multiple cup a day and i had me sense ... which is rare for you mate .,technology
i do not think ive had a cup of tea off you this year .,technology
thats not true .,technology
thats whats happened .,technology
ive always been good .,technology
and now because you make the odd cup you think you are terri earned .,technology
i turned the sensitivity down on my dale kims load because through the night i had a couple of rat running into the bobbin .,technology
i wa fishing quite slack line .,technology
i knew that any beep on them wa probably a fish on the end .,technology
a everyones around i couldnt see my rod i had a single bleep and a i looked around the corner bobbin off tip pulling down .,technology
cool battle with a carp done me multiple weed bed but got it all the way back in .,technology
after what i thought wa going to be one of those few little growons that have got a fifteen pound and it wa erratic the fight i wa convinced it wa one of them .,technology
turn out to be a fifty .,technology
no still hasnt happened but it wa a common of over thirty nine pound .,technology
and then a few hour later i had another bite .,technology
there you go .,technology
cool yeah nice fish .,technology
pettits is getting some big fishing now is not it ?,technology
it is getting there .,technology
do what ?,technology
we worked it out the other day .,technology
there about one hundred and eighty to two hundred carp and probably one hundred of them are over thirty pound .,technology
thats quite insane .,technology
thats good .,technology
yeah and recently in fact the guy that moved in after me he wa on a bit of a social with a load of his mate .,technology
he had one bite at the def new complex record forty sixtwelve .,technology
physical shoulder .,technology
i saw the picture .,technology
it is also become it doe a lot more bite now a doesnt it ?,technology
all of used to be the one where i think it wa quite hard .,technology
all of used to be people used to go out there and struggle .,technology
it probably is for you but i think most people ... no it all seems to be the one ... no it is the trickiest lake on the venue per acre .,technology
there le carp in there than any others but thats why youve got many biggings in there now .,technology
is that the biggest common in the lake ?,technology
again about a couple of week before that one it did it first fortypound common .,technology
i think there nine forty in there now .,technology
is it ?,technology
there a forty three common .,technology
it is a special lake .,technology
i had another bite from there i said a couple of hour later and it wa another thirtypounder .,technology
it is a good thing a that dans opening it up for a vip fee .,technology
yeah he is .,technology
is it three hundred quid for the whole winter ?,technology
thats not bad .,technology
thats good .,technology
that is good .,technology
ive always thought that thing is appealing because youve only got to do that with a mate or another mate share the driving go twice for a decent length session for four night .,technology
it is worth it weight in gold doing that is not it ?,technology
they do it at wolvenstowe a i think at the winter ticket .,technology
and a few other place .,technology
they are worth it if you are going to stay fishing all winter obviously .,technology
i think thatll give a lot of people the inspiration though .,technology
youve got a long a you do nine night through the winter youve paid for your ticket and then you start to effectively make money you are earning out of it .,technology
and it allows you to get into tune with a lake .,technology
i think a lot of people when they pop to a day ticket you are doing the odd trip but if you decide you are going to spend your three hundred quid thats effectively your winter syndicate .,technology
therell be a lot more carport and catch yourself a big in an allnighter .,technology
if the weather stay this it is going to be a good winter .,technology
thats insane is not it ?,technology
it is going to carry on .,technology
youve got to be careful about the syndicate mentality .,technology
a water that normally ha got such a high turnover of people .,technology
you do not often see the same person twice .,technology
you end up with something where you end up probably exchanging a few number .,technology
you can keep in the loop with a venue normally youd know nothing about until you rocked out there .,technology
thats quite good .,technology
where wa it you got after then ?,technology
i went to the youtube been to .,technology
the guy we met at a carp show a guy called dean doug alake in his back garden .,technology
i went and had a go on there .,technology
i fished solid bag of maggot with a few swad of maggot over the top and only had one bite but again at a real nice thirty six for scaly one .,technology
look at that .,technology
thats nice is not it ?,technology
we want to run of decent not luck but you are getting some good one .,technology
that would be a good reading .,technology
that is true .,technology
ive always said it .,technology
i am going tomorrow night a . ive got lot of fishing next week i am hoping that little run can continue .,technology
you going back down there ?,technology
he got some nice fish in there is not he ?,technology
he got some nice stuff in there .,technology
it is one of those .,technology
where are you going then ?,technology
i did a friend of ours when stomper passed away .,technology
we did a charity thing to raise a bit of money for his family .,technology
and one of the guy who wa due to fish it last year i think he got a new job and couldnt do it it is a rearrange trip .,technology
we asked him on there for a cut of the night .,technology
thats an old stomping ground a is not it ?,technology
did you have a ticket on there ?,technology
and now there are two fish that have gone over fifty pound they might be a repeat catch if i get lucky .,technology
doe that count ?,technology
it count for me .,technology
it count for me .,technology
it count for me .,technology
it count for me .,technology
you are going to be gutted though if the first fifty catch a recapture of something youve already caught three time .,technology
surely thats a gutter .,technology
i think the context of this room will be over them .,technology
i do not think gutting is the word catching a fifty pound .,technology
id prefer it to be a new fish .,technology
there one fish in there that i did not catch and thats a zip linear at the minute .,technology
it is probably forty three pounds. . thats the dream to catch that one .,technology
well cross the break before we come to it .,technology
well see what happens .,technology
well see what happens .,technology
coming in all pumped up .,technology
ive had it .,technology
yeah it doesnt count .,technology
what about you rudy ?,technology
talk about your trip mate .,technology
ive been away got back on friday evening .,technology
little trip over to europe .,technology
got in a habit the last three or four year of doing a trip in the spring and a trip in the autumn .,technology
went earlier on in the year with josh that work here josh dull .,technology
had a good trip and this time around i went with oscar thornton one of our sponsored angler .,technology
he can catch them .,technology
he can catch them .,technology
but ive not fished for infrages .,technology
we were on the same syndicate for a few year .,technology
i used to fish a bit together .,technology
but yeah went over two different venue .,technology
first one did not work out very .,technology
we blanked for a couple of night .,technology
that one forgot to grow a wrist of his tail .,technology
the reservoir carp over there are unreal a proper box of chocolate .,technology
every one of them is different .,technology
but yeah that wa from the second venue .,technology
we turned up at this big three hundred acre reservoir .,technology
i did not know hardly anything about it to be honest .,technology
not many people do that .,technology
do they drive out to france and try and find somewhere to fish ?,technology
the thing is a you do these long journey .,technology
we went from the second venue to this one .,technology
it is a four and a half hour drive and the whole time you are thinking probably will not get on .,technology
it is quite annoying in itself .,technology
you think we are probably going to have to have a plan c after this .,technology
but we got there managed to get in a good area .,technology
what we thought wa a good area .,technology
we tried a little bit of intel on where you want to be the time of year but did not know anything about fishing .,technology
and it is called fishing .,technology
it wa fishing super long three hundred and fifty plus meter .,technology
long cast .,technology
yeah long cast .,technology
i did not think i could still do it .,technology
thats a couple of cast .,technology
yeah it wa all boat work .,technology
and the fishing wa incredible from the off .,technology
much that we started getting worried about kit and battery when the action started .,technology
you always take enough be prepared take enough lead hook bait and all the rest of it .,technology
but when it go off preparing for that is obviously impossible .,technology
we ended up putting rod out together .,technology
wed go out in the boat .,technology
all the spot were gps .,technology
we had four different spot fishing four rod each .,technology
and we would go out to each individual spot get above it .,technology
id have my one .,technology
wed lower the rod off .,technology
then id take both of the rod hold them out to the side a cut of sword .,technology
and then wed trundle back to the bank .,technology
coys coal .,technology
it is a nice carp .,technology
some of them are grey .,technology
some of them are peachy looking .,technology
and it can be twenty five pound or sixty five pound .,technology
how many did you catch it ?,technology
we couldnt work it out .,technology
it got crazy .,technology
i think i wa saying to you this morning .,technology
we ended up putting back nice looking thirty pounder .,technology
having a quick look in the net and putting them back and sitting back after thinking this is mad fishing .,technology
we shouldnt be doing this .,technology
we should be getting these out in a nice photo with them all .,technology
but it wa crazy .,technology
i think we had about fifty five carp in four day .,technology
which is a relentless action .,technology
i did five pack of crankx hook .,technology
thank god i took enough with me .,technology
but yeah unbelievable fishing .,technology
explain what you do for permit .,technology
and how much doe it cost in that ?,technology
yeah you have to get a cartetepêche license which is a bit our rod license here i guess .,technology
which cover you for where you have to choose the region .,technology
you can get a week or you can get a year .,technology
it is not expensive for a year permit .,technology
no i do not think it is .,technology
i do not know how much it is for a year .,technology
it is time i do it because i am only doing it in those small window .,technology
i never think i am going to go back that year .,technology
i think it is about two hundred something euro .,technology
is it ?,technology
because i am getting one for u for next year .,technology
yeah i think i paid about forty six euro which will cover me for probably about five week or something .,technology
i do not know. . a long a youve got that and these lake are public and not syndicate you can rock up chance your arm .,technology
and you can get that online can you ?,technology
you can get that online .,technology
you go online cartetepêche and it will come up .,technology
and then you can translate into english .,technology
obviously do some research on where you think you might be going .,technology
if you are going total opposite end of the spectrum you probably have to check make sure you get the license for the region .,technology
i think thats the case anyway .,technology
i am pretty sure it is .,technology
driving others .,technology
he wa a bit of a joke driving home .,technology
because oscar already had his because he bought a year one from when he went earlier in the year .,technology
he went that wa a waste of forty six euro wasnt it ?,technology
but you have to have it .,technology
yeah of course you do .,technology
youve got to check with these place .,technology
you are allowed to night fish .,technology
a lot of these place have small dedicated night zone .,technology
you go there .,technology
you feel yeah i am in the prime swim get set up .,technology
if you havent done your research you quickly find out that you can not do the night .,technology
then you are fishing day only in an area where all the bike are coming at night .,technology
and the french on dame do not take you too .,technology
no you hear all the horror story .,technology
ive had some horrible thing happen in the past .,technology
it is not for the fainthearted .,technology
youve got every wit about you .,technology
i do not think id be that comfortable going on my own .,technology
a lot of people do .,technology
they are not trying their own .,technology
that adventure with when you get to share it with someone else it mean a lot more i think .,technology
i think even boat work on your own when you are not fluent in the boat a a a bit that is ... you need to be doing it with your mate .,technology
yeah and when you are not doing it for age we are saying a you probably find a and you guy when you do the monster cup you start off do not you a little bit finding your foot a little bit .,technology
but the time you go home you are a good a anybody and then you forget it all .,technology
you go back and forth .,technology
it is waiting for something .,technology
yeah eight year still not that good in a boat .,technology
even by the end of the trip it is still that .,technology
i think whatever r you want i know dan doesnt boat fishing that much either .,technology
i wa talking to him about it .,technology
he doesnt it that much. ?,technology
i absolutely love it .,technology
it is the way id to fish but i must admit when we got two and a half day into that i wa thinking old boat would half be nice when you are towing out that long .,technology
back and forth back and forth .,technology
yeah weve had it a few time in hungary .,technology
you are normally not allowed to use big boat there .,technology
we certainly werent on the lake we were fishing .,technology
and you are fishing out long way .,technology
how far out were we fishing ?,technology
one hundred and sixty or something ?,technology
no one hundred and twenty i think .,technology
one hundred and twenty .,technology
and you can catch many more of a boat .,technology
that is the only time a boat but i think it is when you are allowed to use them .,technology
it is boring though is not it ?,technology
it is but especially in the same situation you are having there it wa we are catching load of you are not catching little one but we are catching even smaller fish than the one you were catching .,technology
if you are doing that in a proper boat and it take you a long time to go back out you do get no sleep .,technology
it is easier with one of them .,technology
it is the kit a you need .,technology
obviously with two of you take two of you take two lot of kit .,technology
obviously i think we took six leisure battery and the two boat and all the rest of it .,technology
but if you did not have all that stuff you thought i am going to chuck a leisure battery on board on my boat and i am going to get you get caught out within a day and a half and you trip through it .,technology
you have much stuff .,technology
even when i go each time now there always a great big list on my phone when i come home .,technology
definitely need more of them .,technology
need another one of them .,technology
you should ... we need a spare boat .,technology
a spare boat one hundred you do .,technology
yeah there no point going on them trip without a spare engine spare boat repair kit spare leisure battery .,technology
damien who one of our sponsored angler in france that help u out massively on our trip he an amazing boat .,technology
and he doe a lot of them long trip .,technology
he work six month of the year a a chef in his restaurant and then ha the rest of the year off and fish all the time .,technology
you can imagine how good he is in them scenario .,technology
and he take because he doe them long trip hell take ... it is a fold out solar panel thats probably the size of this table .,technology
and i think it is a day charge for one of his battery .,technology
obviously if you have that on rotation you are in good stead all the time .,technology
but yeah certainly some fishing i love doing .,technology
i think the fact that you do not know everything nowadays i think itll probably segue into what we are going to talk about later but that european fishing the mystery is still one hundred there the whole time you are there because you do not know anything .,technology
your next bite could be fifty five pound .,technology
you do not know any of the carp .,technology
ive had a few 70 using boat work .,technology
how many of them are you at ?,technology
about one .,technology
there you go .,technology
that did not work out did it ?,technology
yeah not a good one .,technology
how wa you catching them then ?,technology
exactly the same a our fish here .,technology
the only thing i stepped up wa my hook to an x. i normally use standard crank .,technology
i wa using crank hex in a size four .,technology
there you go .,technology
thats how i wa catching them .,technology
i am going to go with a hook .,technology
i am going to go with a hook .,technology
i am going to go with a hook .,technology
i am going to go with a hook .,technology
i am going to go with a hook .,technology
i am going to go with a hook .,technology
i am going to go with a hook .,technology
i wa using crank hex in a size four .,technology
there you go .,technology
thats how i wa catching them .,technology
the only thing i wa doing slightly different because everything we caught wa on double 20mm bottom baits. . there a lot of bust on chat and if anyone do not know they are the little tiny catfish and a few nuisance craze and stuff .,technology
this time of year weve gone not normally too bad for those but because of that we were using big bait .,technology
the only thing i did slightly different ive been using the i know you did ive used double hook bead quite a lot when i am using ronnys and woffters but i pulled the bead down to where the shrink tube end .,technology
there wa some travel there .,technology
in my mind it wa it is a huge bait .,technology
i wanted to be able to get out of the way a soon a the caught swallowed it .,technology
can you not use a longer bit of shrink tube there though ?,technology
no because thats on a swivel is not it ?,technology
doe that go over the shrink tube ?,technology
you could but id be worried about the hook ring swivel being able to pas over that thing .,technology
. . it is locking on .,technology
nothing he doe .,technology
nothing he doe in his mind .,technology
see thats i would lose them that .,technology
i genuinely ive fished a lot that before out on them big lake and ive lost them and you lost one out of thirty bite or whatever .,technology
and i use a similar rig in i went to a place a commercial water called teleats a couple of year back a few year back and use that exact presentation there a . they had twenty seven bite landed all of them .,technology
thats what i meant .,technology
that exact presentation .,technology
i swear they are person to person .,technology
they can you could that .,technology
dimo could give me one of these rig and id lose it on it .,technology
and it then hed lad ten out of ten .,technology
you play your carp generally a lot harder than most people ive seen though .,technology
get them back out .,technology
get them back out .,technology
do you think ill plan that hard ?,technology
it is they are white cape .,technology
you couldnt learn the carp on a white cape .,technology
thats when i first joined and i wa screwing because i kept losing fish on them and him and dan are landing everything they hook on them .,technology
it is it is your preference .,technology
i think what it doe do though catching all of them on them on them big double bottom bait .,technology
thats something i never do here now .,technology
year ago when i first started fishing it wa all snowman or two .,technology
i know dimo doe load of that fishing and i think ive seen him doing that quite a lot and you feel i am going to try it and you do not .,technology
and then you go there and get forced to because of nuisance fishing stuff .,technology
get all them result .,technology
you think how am i doing that ?,technology
why are not i doing that ?,technology
i always think that when we are ill never stop doing using high visual hook bait because it work .,technology
but we know they come in sometimes and single that out .,technology
i think most of the time it work out that you catch more it but sometimes it doe work against you .,technology
yeah for sure .,technology
but it is figuring out when that is in it thats the thing .,technology
yeah it is whatever your confidence with is not it ?,technology
i think the standard bottom bait you hardly ever see anybody using it and you never see somebody with two bottom bait on their hair .,technology
it work when you are changing sometimes .,technology
there buoyancy in everybodys hook bait .,technology
fish get used to seeing it do not they ?,technology
shall we get into this question ?,technology
chuck it up .,technology
i wa sent to spooner privately on facebook which i thought wa a good question and with how far technology ha come over the last ten year with rig mechanic and i think well explore this wider where could it be in the next ten year ?,technology
i think it is a good question .,technology
i think we can spin off technology in load of different way .,technology
it doesnt have to necessarily be rig mechanic hook swivel lead .,technology
i think it can be social medium god know what else the internet the fact the information out there .,technology
briefly mentioned this to daemo this morning .,technology
he wasnt that convinced it is come that far wa he daemo ?,technology
i do not think it ha .,technology
if i go back to when i wa nineteen twenty we were fishing the i am fifty three this week thats a long time thats thirty three year .,technology
thats a good memory .,technology
you are a cheeky bastard .,technology
the biggest significant change in tackle at that point wa we were using eleven foot two pound twelve foot two pound two and a quarter long range fishing you stepped up to a two and a half .,technology
you wouldnt go barbell fishing with them lot of now .,technology
we were fishing little weedy lake where the cart were getting away because you did not have the power in the tackle to get them in .,technology
we were fishing with cardinal 55s and that thing very small rod and reel compared to what wa available today .,technology
the most significant advance i think in fishing rod at that point would have been about that wa ninety one ninety one ninety two ninety one ninety two dawa come out with the amorphous fishing rod .,technology
that absolutely changed the game .,technology
you could hook up we could hook up in the same lake and they couldnt get in the weed and we could pull them in with the weed and it wa absolute game changer .,technology
we had s 3000s came out .,technology
i wa fortunate that id been using dawa gear for a long time prior to that .,technology
knew the guy who became the md dawa i got one of the very first set of amorphous and the s 3000s .,technology
they were completely different .,technology
when wa the s then ?,technology
about ninety one .,technology
they are still doing that real now .,technology
you are talking about i think the amorphous wa the biggest change and then from that point onwards everybody else caught up .,technology
fishing rod have improved because material have improved fishing line have improved but i am fishing at the moment with our three pounder which are probably not too dissimilar to the amorphous .,technology
because if youve got a two and three quarter now youd probably float a fish with it .,technology
then it wa the ultimate long range rod but i am using s 3000s .,technology
i am using our three pounder on this little lake .,technology
i am using some of my old tackle that i use .,technology
ive got bank stick from twenty year ago with steve neville because i collect tackle and ive been using it for the last thousand year .,technology
yeah it is nice .,technology
it is the same gear that i wa using thirty year ago .,technology
thing havent moved on that far .,technology
youve got a much sharper hook on now though do you think ?,technology
no because i used to sharpen more hook then .,technology
i think to the mass though id agree .,technology
you said if people are not sharpening their hook and i think the ease of rig mechanic now if we look at something youd say in the last ten year the spinner rig is something thats come about is not it in the last ten year ?,technology
that is a tie a couple of time and you are an absolute expert at tying it .,technology
you have not got to have any brain power .,technology
it is easy .,technology
you can change the hook .,technology
and you are presented nine time out of ten .,technology
thats the key is not it ?,technology
but my rig going back to when i wa nineteen wa a helicopter rig which wa two bead pulled on a bit of tubing with a swivel in it .,technology
all it did not drop the lead and it wa probably not the safest rig in the world but it wa never tangled and i had a sharp hook on because i sharpened it myself because hook were shit absolute shit .,technology
and i had to sharpen it with the lead and door and mustard hook .,technology
they were terrible .,technology
in that perspective youve got hook that are readily available to everybody that are sharp .,technology
but i think i could use the same gear now and catch what i am catching .,technology
but i think we should do a match shouldnt we ?,technology
i think there a big caveat there though damir .,technology
you were doing that thirty year ago .,technology
you were sharpening hook and you were fishing a heli setup that you knew wa presented .,technology
how many people around you were doing the same thing and having the same result ?,technology
i do not know if they were group they were but you end up being the product developer of the company .,technology
thats the stress thats been .,technology
thats the point though is not it ?,technology
you said you had that little group of people doing it doing it and youd argue we could probably sit around this table and name all those people individually that stand out that we are doing it .,technology
now everything is available to absolutely everybody .,technology
everybody can be a a far a rig mechanic and stuff go everyone can be a damian clark everyone can be a terriern because it is all there ready made to chuck on cast out and then obviously the watercraft and the fig start coming into it then .,technology
but a far a the actual rig side of thing go being available to absolutely everyone in the last ten year is something thats prevalent .,technology
but bait hasnt moved on either .,technology
yeah it is all the same .,technology
it all come around in a circle .,technology
i think the wider discussion is probably in ten year time .,technology
and you are talking about thirty year ago .,technology
thirty year ago .,technology
yeah not even ten year ago .,technology
ten year ago we were using the spinner .,technology
do you think ?,technology
no not far off .,technology
no i reckon it wa eight year ago .,technology
it is before we moved in here .,technology
yeah but it is definitely not a wide a it is .,technology
it must be the last five year that it is gone berserk and it last five six year .,technology
yeah we had probably tied one and all the rest of it is definitely last five six year .,technology
but i think when we brought out the spinner swivel which wa thomas idea and dan put it on whatever dvd it wa .,technology
no no i did a monster cast of it .,technology
because we were air shipping in boem werent we ?,technology
i think we sold eighteen month worth in about three week .,technology
everyone wanted to use that rig .,technology
do you get a bonus out of that ?,technology
yeah probably .,technology
you said that is if you walk around a day ticket now or a syndicate you could maybe not everyone but a large percentage of people will have spinner rig out .,technology
do i think one of my biggest thing if you label technology wider than the actual ntac on the product itself i would say the information available to people now is probably one of the biggest thing in the last ten year .,technology
because ten year ago instagram facebook and it were quite infancy werent they ?,technology
not everybody wa on them .,technology
maybe facebook they were .,technology
facebooks probably twenty year old now .,technology
but cartfishing going on it how big is it now ?,technology
it is enormous now is not it on social medium .,technology
and the information now to any lake pretty much if you are a member of somewhere or you go to a group of lake or something you can find out everything thats going on there .,technology
i opened up your mobile phone .,technology
year ago when ... mate year ago it wa get the angling time .,technology
giving an example i remember getting ... my dad used to buy me the angling time every week .,technology
it is thats the only bit of information or anything to read if you every week .,technology
and there wa a picture of this lad on the back and i recognized him .,technology
and it wa a twenty eight very cool .,technology
and i thought i know where that is .,technology
i wa fourteen .,technology
i want to join there .,technology
i am going to go down there .,technology
and i joined it .,technology
i caught that fish before the next angling time .,technology
of course you did .,technology
yeah of course you did .,technology
we expected that .,technology
but that wa all there wa .,technology
it wa in word of mouth everything wa ... what fish wa it though mate ?,technology
pigeon at the garrison .,technology
yeah i do miss that .,technology
magazine i remember you used to go fishing place and that and you would think ... youd know a certain fish wa in there .,technology
if i go back x amount of year it might be a twenty five mirror or something .,technology
and you think i am going to catch it this weekend .,technology
and then you are going to pick up carp talk or something that .,technology
it is big fish now !,technology
but now youd know in the same day wouldnt you ?,technology
pretty much go up or someone would come in the office and say to fully scale one come out of such and such you go you are joking .,technology
i wa going to go that weekend and you hope you find there it is .,technology
that is ... thats real double edged innit ?,technology
it sped everything up .,technology
yeah i think it is amazing that people can get that information .,technology
if they want to they might find out for example a lake fishing and itll make them go .,technology
theyve got stuff at this go at the weekend it is fishing .,technology
and at the same time that youve lost that not knowing and rocking up and finding out whats going to happen for yourself you everythings done for you a little bit is not it ?,technology
i still do not think you truly know them until you get there do you ?,technology
you get there and fish it .,technology
yeah thats what i wa going to say .,technology
you still feel excited when you drive through the gate and you still cast out not knowing whether you are going to get one or not .,technology
yeah not .,technology
thats why we all do it innit ?,technology
yeah i it is whether or not that that social medium thing you device a lot of opinion doesnt it ?,technology
i do not think sometimes you need you can know too much .,technology
and then it id rather live in a bit of ignorance go to the lake and if the biggings been out when i am there or come out the night before doesnt matter doe it ?,technology
the difference because i wa a member of a syndicate a few year ago with a load of biggings in it and there wa guy on there older guy and theyve been on there forever .,technology
they do not do social medium they havent got a modern phone or anything that .,technology
and theyll say i had three yesterday at a forty seven mirror or wherever they are not that bothered it is been matshotted .,technology
and then theyll show you and ill go it is the peach and theyll go is it ?,technology
ill go it is the peach ?,technology
it is what i want .,technology
ill go ive had him load of time .,technology
it is that that art of going for or the thing of going fishing and enjoying it .,technology
not bothered about getting stuff up on social medium .,technology
obviously unfortunately fortunately or unfortunately for u in this room it is our industry .,technology
we rely on people getting that information and feeding off it and doing something about it and going fishing buying kit and catching carp .,technology
we can not have a problem with it .,technology
i havent got a problem with it .,technology
ill tell people what i am catching on that the lake i am fishing and then it get busy because of it .,technology
but that is part of it .,technology
if people are going to go and enjoy themselves because ive posted something great .,technology
but then on the flip side of that and you can tell that they are nonpublicity .,technology
you can go down there and catch lot and go back down there the next week and get back in the same stream .,technology
that is nice .,technology
that is the difference .,technology
not going to laugh .,technology
but also thats also etiquette .,technology
the etiquette ha changed massively .,technology
there is no etiquette on a lot of these lake .,technology
no you have to live with it a little bit .,technology
tie it down raise it a little bit .,technology
you fish one swim for a little bit catch quite a few out of it and then you can not get back in that swim any more .,technology
that happens all the time .,technology
it is part of it .,technology
mate do not tell me about that .,technology
you never wrap spot .,technology
funny enough we had that last week .,technology
when you were having such a great time we were last week i thought it is going to be great .,technology
i should do a story tomorrow .,technology
but i sat down and even i thought if i do that thats going to show everyone a mirror .,technology
everyone you are carving up and having a good time .,technology
and the people that do know that do not can guess from where you theyll be down here .,technology
theyll come down and it is going to ruin it for me .,technology
i am i shut them up when i get home .,technology
ill keep that a little bit quiet .,technology
and you are french trip .,technology
but then i am going to come down and ... not english people but youll get a lot of european following you and stuff and theyll see ... you can not have that many .,technology
no there can not be that many .,technology
no there no point in putting anything out live while you are there .,technology
not because they are going to come down and ruin our fishing but because you are worried about thing what happened to darrell when they come down and burn your vehicle out .,technology
you are not welcome .,technology
and you never know if you are that welcome at place do you ?,technology
we are quieter now when we go away .,technology
keep a bit of a lower profile .,technology
shout about it after .,technology
i do not know mate .,technology
it is part and parcel .,technology
fishing busier now because more people are doing it .,technology
i think it is good that more people fish because i think fishing good for people .,technology
you have to live with it i think .,technology
let go around and have a little think about where we think it could be in ten year time .,technology
because obviously weve talked about there not being load of huge advance in the last ten year other than isolated product that are helping thing become easier to the mass .,technology
but where do you think it could be in ten year ?,technology
maybe if it is an advance in technology and tackle or social medium where could it get to do you think ?,technology
yeah i do not know .,technology
i think we are a little bit in this spot in general in life a not in fishing but technology is increasing at such a rate that you either move with the technology and everyone accepts it or there more rule .,technology
with the whole ai thing is a government going to put more rule in to stop ai from happening a much a it could do if you let it run ?,technology
and it is the same with fishing .,technology
are lake going to ban using drone ?,technology
yeah lot of them already have .,technology
yeah there technology of using boat boat and that make fishing infinitely easier .,technology
but doe it come into our fishing that much ?,technology
if fishery owner and club or whatever want to keep the essence of fishing there then they will put rule in place to stop people ruining it .,technology
and thats what tends to happen .,technology
i do not think fishing will change that much .,technology
i think well probably get more and more information .,technology
itll become easier and easier to the mass a it ha done over the last ten year .,technology
but in general you will not feel any different going fishing and neither will i in ten year time .,technology
i do not think .,technology
how do you feel about the technology that is out there now ?,technology
are you people that embrace it and think if you want to use it use it ?,technology
or have you got a problem with it ?,technology
dang id probably be the best person to ask .,technology
i havent got a problem with it a long a you do not come anywhere near me .,technology
if you want to start flying drone over in the swim or putting a boat boat through the swim then i am going to have a problem with that .,technology
but i am not going to put myself in the position where i am fishing lake where thats happening .,technology
there nothing i wouldnt say to ali face .,technology
but he wa fishing a little lake and he had a drone up and wa driving a boat boat to the spot using the drone to see where it wa .,technology
i am not interested in doing that .,technology
you all go fishing for your own reason .,technology
the thing i about fishing is working it out and using my own skill if you to put the lead in the boat exactly where i want it to go .,technology
if you become completely reliant on gadget and technology if something go wrong with that we were talking about your boat engine going wrong you can not do it because you are reliant on it .,technology
ive seen people fishing a little lake that the garrison we were and he putting his bait out with a bait boat not much further than between me and you under a bush .,technology
and you think what are you doing there for ?,technology
you could put it there .,technology
i love getting in the lake and putting my rod out or whatever that is .,technology
but there got to be an element of skill and the chase of whatever you are going for .,technology
if youve made that particular cast and it is difficult and it is taking you three cast and you think gosh it is on the spot .,technology
technology is great for certain thing but it is not for me .,technology
i do not need to know if there bait left in the swim and putting a camera on the bottom of the lake because i see people we know disappearing up their own arses because they know too much .,technology
it is blowing their head up .,technology
and sometimes i am quite happy living in ignorance .,technology
yes good point .,technology
i do not have you wrong with that .,technology
i do think thats a good point you are saying about the camera and stuff .,technology
i spoke to stokesy when i wa going out to carp arena and he wa fishing some snag in the swim .,technology
i knew i wa going to fish .,technology
he said if youve got one of those camera you can lower down .,technology
he go because when i wa fishing there i thought i wa fishing perfectly .,technology
i wa lowering the rig down getting a good drop .,technology
but when i put the camera down there wa load of stick .,technology
my boom wa sticking up and all the way .,technology
he said if you do not get one your chance are you will not be fishing .,technology
and i did not get one because i did not want to go down that route .,technology
i am not saying they are not good because i think the camera could be a big edge for thing commercial water .,technology
when you are turning up for a week and you are following someone in a peg .,technology
and you want to check the spot where you are working .,technology
yeah you can go out there and lower a camera down on the twenty wrap at the big tree that everyone fish .,technology
and there forty kilo there .,technology
itll stop you putting twenty kilo out which i think could make a difference to your week .,technology
i do not think they are a bad thing but for me you said i think you could end up ... because if you go to the one water we can not use it .,technology
and all of a sudden then you feel ive got the same drop i wa getting before but i wa sitting terribly .,technology
i am probably sitting terribly .,technology
i think you can know too much .,technology
you are talking about camera .,technology
i saw on i think it wa instagram the other day there a start up where theyve got ... the line is a camera cable .,technology
youve got a camera on the end of your fishing line which is must be some i do not know ... i saw this .,technology
it is an electrical fishing line is not it ?,technology
yeah electrical fishing line .,technology
they are lure fishing and you can see on your rod whats coming to get it .,technology
it is they are crowdfunding trying to start getting a start up for it .,technology
i guess thats where this question come from .,technology
how far in ten year time will that become the norm ?,technology
we are going to see much more of that .,technology
that wa unbelievable .,technology
what a time i had .,technology
i am going to do that again next week .,technology
it is a lot more exciting .,technology
we are ingrained in it .,technology
that to u is the same feeling either way .,technology
it go back to what daymo said each their own is not it ?,technology
it is if you are happy with doing it thats fine .,technology
it is not a hobby is not it ?,technology
it is you do not ruin my day it is fine .,technology
it is you do not have you on .,technology
daymo you wouldnt have all those modern day thing if you were in charge of a syndicate theyd be no way .,technology
i think it is you and the fish .,technology
what about going to huge venue in europe ?,technology
ill get that .,technology
we had this conversation when dan wa in here did not we ?,technology
using the drone to find the fish .,technology
if youve got a week to do it if thats what you want to do then time yes .,technology
if you are making a film and it is costing a load of money i can see why we would do it .,technology
unless you are bait boating out at twenty five even up to thirty mil hookbaits at some point you are not even fishing for the fish that you are trying to catch .,technology
they become a for me a necessary evil .,technology
i am not going to cut my nose off despite my face .,technology
i am not going to sit there catching small fish after small fish because i do not want to use a bait boat .,technology
you feel you have to .,technology
and i guess going back to the camera side of thing i said it is you when we were doing the underwater test tape .,technology
after dan had caught the big crane it wa me and you and it wa my turn to have a rod on the spot .,technology
now if i wa fishing and ive gone fishing ive got a single rod up against a snag i would be sitting there the whole time thinking any minute thats going to go the carp going to come in going to get one bite .,technology
when you can watch it happen and a exciting it is when it is on when it is not and there nothing in that swim .,technology
you want to cry .,technology
yeah it wa horrible .,technology
you sit there and start that .,technology
and then a you said you can know too much .,technology
i think the drone now is especially for talking to the european guy that i talk to that is a important a their fishing rod .,technology
having a drone in the kit is a important a anything .,technology
one of the guy who work here is fishing a big lake ?,technology
and he a traditionalist if you .,technology
he not going to use a drone .,technology
he walk around the lake he doe his homework he bait up .,technology
and on that lake everybodys got a drone .,technology
theyve all got bait boat that have got gps system on them .,technology
hell get an area going .,technology
theyll people will find out where he catching from .,technology
and then youve got bait coming across three hundred yard and they are coming into a swim .,technology
that go back to the etiquette thing doesnt it ?,technology
sorry all of these thing are if people have got etiquette and they are used ?,technology
but if they are not then it ruin the whole thing .,technology
yeah it leaf a sour taste then doesnt it ?,technology
it doe when he sat there at night he sat up and you can see the little light coming across the lake .,technology
they are coming out and they are ... in his swim .,technology
ill tell you something they are using staying on the drone subject a minute .,technology
something they are using a lot in sport fishing and that now .,technology
they are using them to take the bait out .,technology
fishing from the shore .,technology
that is going to creep into carp fishing .,technology
ive got no doubt about it .,technology
that will creep into carp fishing .,technology
fishing you said inaccessible place .,technology
i think thing ... ive always thought something a zig is made for something that .,technology
you can put it out fish it out long .,technology
not having to worry about tangling .,technology
maybe have a little pva loop on it .,technology
you can lower it down and it fall down .,technology
there are many example of where that could help .,technology
and i do think people more and more people are doing it .,technology
ive seen little reel and thing on instagram .,technology
people are using it in carp fishing .,technology
but i think for baiting up and stuff that is coming .,technology
that will be a thing .,technology
someone in our industry will bring out drone for carp fishing .,technology
ive got no doubt about that .,technology
u . i am going to get off on the screen now .,technology
this is coming out in a couple of week .,technology
i think tom though .,technology
those thing will get banned by lot and lot of water .,technology
can you imagine that on linear ?,technology
yeah i know .,technology
they will not allow it .,technology
i think with technology if it make something thats impossible possible it is with me .,technology
but when it make something thats already possible easy thats when i do not it .,technology
anything of true value is difficult or rare .,technology
and if you make it too easy then it is neither of them .,technology
and then it ha no value to anyone .,technology
and then that ruin the whole thing .,technology
catching a fifty pounder .,technology
youll probably catch one next week droning out .,technology
it still count .,technology
youve got all that technology available now .,technology
weve got bait boat to take out and touch with a button .,technology
weve got the best possible bait .,technology
the sharpest hook .,technology
yet you still can not catch a fifty pounder .,technology
there is no excuse now is there ?,technology
everything is available there .,technology
it is available but the person using it ha still got to know what they are doing .,technology
havent they ?,technology
have they ?,technology
that worry me quite a bit in our industry sometimes .,technology
when stuff get brought out thats easy to use and the fact you can chuck it on and cast it out not having any foundation of looking after a carp playing it in knowing anything .,technology
you can go out and spend five grand on kit and go out there and pretty much do it quite on some lake .,technology
i do not know man .,technology
i do not think you can .,technology
i think the analogy which i use with spooner quite a lot even a blind squirrel find them sometimes .,technology
do what ?,technology
no but ill stay on that because you can .,technology
because if you go to a known lake in the uk thats a day ticket place if you get in certain swim youve got to fish in the middle and thats where all the fish live and it is not particularly weedy .,technology
youve got a bait boat and youve got to set the gps on it put the bait in and the readytied rig and all that .,technology
yeah we have a bait boat in the uk and yeah .,technology
whats this here ?,technology
this is going to be a drone man is not it ?,technology
we are going to catch you using a shark .,technology
shark using stingray head .,technology
whats a pretty big bit of kit in it ?,technology
for anyone listening and not watching the lad have put a video on the screen .,technology
that hasnt got any sound .,technology
yeah thats going to show a guy putting out a huge piece of old fish boat .,technology
that is a massive drone a . i think ive seen these on instagram .,technology
and the thing is theyve designed them with quick release stuff on the controller and stuff .,technology
yeah how is that not fun ?,technology
thats what it mean .,technology
this is the thing this is why people get into this type of fishing .,technology
look at that churning out a barge .,technology
there no finesse in that fishing is there ?,technology
no big lump of fish .,technology
you can not compare the result can you ?,technology
it is the same a a bait boat .,technology
you can not compare the result from a bait boat and a nonbait boat .,technology
if you catch ten on a bait boat and you are caught free normal .,technology
i am not going to start naming any name but there are some quite influential people in our industry that have caught some famous carp using a bait boat and all the carp out of that lake on a bait boat .,technology
we do not need to say who it is but i am saying there is people that have gone on syndicate emptied them .,technology
the only thing is they are holding up for the camera but theyve caught a lot of them fish .,technology
it is look at something burfield for example .,technology
there pretty much nobody on there .,technology
i think i think theyve banned them recently .,technology
but before that i listened to a podcast when i wa driving out to france .,technology
it wa elliot on fishing burfield .,technology
and he wa saying that his bait boat broke and it stopped him going for about four week because he wa waiting for it to come back .,technology
he couldnt go without it because he couldnt fish the spot he wanted to fish by casting because they are too far and they are obviously weird angle or whatever out past weed .,technology
it stopped him going fishing .,technology
we had another one of our angler wa fishing a lake that we fished and we were moaning at him because he wa using his boat all the time and exactly the same thing happened .,technology
he wa trying to borrow one of our old one because he did not want to go there without it .,technology
thats the thing when you start relying on technology though is not it ?,technology
it will stop you going .,technology
for example would you still go if you were on a syndicate and you did a lot of fishing on the winter or whatever and maggot were the way forward on their bit of body crumb of maggot and maggot were a shortage ?,technology
would you still go for three night without them knowing that chance are you aint going to catch nothing ?,technology
probably not .,technology
no it is not me .,technology
sometimes these thing do stop you going when you need to still go .,technology
everyone care much about their time doesnt they ?,technology
and you want to make the most of your time .,technology
and i think thats what people the routine people get into .,technology
it is they go over there they are enjoying their time in the short space of time because it is making it easy for them .,technology
and then when you havent got it it is i am going to sit there for four day for a ten for the result .,technology
but ive not started in the beginning i think using it .,technology
i think it is a good topic and i think well probably end up revisiting this at some point a thing come out and thing evolve when the flying drone come out with the spot on the end we can start talking about it again .,technology
it is good though it is a good conversation .,technology
you can talk about it all day .,technology
i think well wrap it up there .,technology
i enjoyed that .,technology
that went quick .,technology
yeah it did go quick .,technology
i think well get some more question in for the next one .,technology
hopefully for you if you are getting out fishing i know you are going out demoing next week .,technology
you are going to wait are you going out tom ?,technology
yeah i am out this week a . i blanked last week .,technology
i do not that .,technology
well say the guy that sent in that question that weve been talking about i think it wa leon frail something that sent it to you .,technology
well get his detail spoon and well send him a little merch bundle a we said we would .,technology
any of the question that we use and do not forget we are going to be going through them all the time .,technology
even if you sent one in the second podcast before last we could still end up plucking your question out .,technology
keep the question coming because they are great .,technology
the following is a conversation with roger panros physicist mathematician and philosopher at university of oxford .,technology
he ha made fundamental contribution in many discipline from the mathematical physic of general relativity and cosmology to the limitation of computational view of consciousness .,technology
in his book the emperor new mind roger writes that quote child are not afraid to pose basic question that may embarrass u a adult to ask .,technology
in many way my goal with this podcast is to embrace the inner child that is not constrained by how one should behave speak and think in the adult world .,technology
roger is one of the most important mind of our time it wa truly a pleasure and an honor to talk with them .,technology
this conversation wa recorded before the outbreak of the pandemic .,technology
for everyone feeling the medical psychological and financial burden of the crisis i am sending love your way .,technology

and now here my conversation with roger penrose .,technology
you mentioned in conversation with eric weissstein on the portal podcast that two thousand and one space odyssey is your favorite movie .,technology
which aspect if you could mention of it representation of artificial intelligence science engineering connected with you ?,technology
there were also some scene there which is amazing .,technology
and how they science wa done .,technology
people say you interstellar this amazing movie which is the most scientific movie .,technology
i thought it is not a patch on two thousand and one .,technology
they went into also to detail .,technology
and they are getting the free fall done .,technology
and if anything i thought it wa streaming done .,technology
the detail were my mind rising .,technology
i do not know if there thing the scene where at the beginning they have these human ancestor which is eight eight becoming monolith .,technology
and it is the one where he throw the bone up into the air .,technology
and then it becomes this there le than amazing sequence there .,technology
what do you make of the monolith ?,technology
doe it have any scientific or philosophical meaning to you ?,technology
doe think of the most box innovation ?,technology
that come from artistic clark .,technology
i wa always a great fan about the clark .,technology
it is a nice plot device .,technology
yeah another plot is excellent .,technology
how ninezero decides to get rid of the astronaut because he it she belief that they will interfere with the mission .,technology
it is this view .,technology
i do not know whether i disagree with it question to certain sense .,technology
see the the machine seemed to think it wa a superior to the human .,technology
and it wa entitled to get rid of the human being and run the show itself .,technology
what do you think how did the thing ?,technology
do you think how is flawed evil or if we think about system how would we want how to do the same thing in the future ?,technology
what wa the flaw there ?,technology
it is one supposed to believe that how wa conscious .,technology
it wa played rather that way a though how wa a conscious being because how wa showed some pain some cognitive the hell appeared to be cognizant of what it mean to die .,technology
and therefore had that .,technology
thats yes .,technology
and the inkling of conscious .,technology
i am not sure that aspect of it wa made completely clear whether how wa adjusted very sophisticated computer which did not have these feeling and somehow .,technology
if you are it did not make the idea being turned off .,technology
how doe it change thing if how wa it wasnt conscious ?,technology
it might say that it would be wrong to turn it off if it wa conscious .,technology
these question arise if you think ai wanted the idea .,technology
it is a mixture in a sense .,technology
you say if it is trying to do everything a human can do and if you take the view that consciousness is something which would come along when the computer is sufficiently complicated sufficiently whatever criterion and you use to characterize it consciousness in term of some computational criterion .,technology
how doe consciousness change our evaluation of the decision that hell made ?,technology
i guess ive started to say that people have been confused about this .,technology
because if they say these machine will overcome conscious but simply because it is a degree of computation .,technology
and when you get beyond that it is a certain degree of computation .,technology
it will overcome conscious .,technology
then of course you have all these problem .,technology
you might say one of the reason you are doing ai is because you are going to send a device out to some distant planet .,technology
and you do not want to send a human out there because then you have to bring it back again .,technology
and thats cost you far more than sending it there and leaving it there .,technology
but if this device is a conscious entity then you have to face up to the fact that thats immoral .,technology
and the mere fact that you are making some ai device and getting a thinking that remove your responsibility to it would be incorrect .,technology
and this is a flaw in that viewpoint .,technology
i am not sure how people who take it very .,technology
i am going to have this curious conversation with i am going to forget name and i am afraid because this is what happens to me at the moment .,technology
how stuttered .,technology
and hed written this book god i that .,technology
i thought it wa a fantastic book .,technology
but i did not agree with his conclusion from god or stephen .,technology
i think hed gone it wrong. ?,technology
i tell you my story because id never met him .,technology
and then i knew i wa going to meet him .,technology
the occasion i excuse coming in you want to talk to me and thats fine .,technology
and i thought in my mind i am going to paint him into a corner ?,technology
his argument to convince him that certain number are conscious .,technology
some integer large enough integer are conscious .,technology
and this wa going to be my reductive i had a certain .,technology
i started having this argument with him .,technology
he simply leapt into the corner .,technology
he did not even need to be painted into it .,technology
he took the view of it said number were conscious .,technology
i thought that wa the reductive id have said them .,technology
but he seemed to think it wa perfectly reasonable point to do .,technology
without the absurdum there yes interesting .,technology
but the thing you mentioned about how is the intuition that a lot of the people at least in the artificial intelligence world had and have i think they do not make it explicit but that if you increase the power of computation naturally consciousness will emerge .,technology
yeah i think thats what they think .,technology
thats because they can not think of anything else .,technology
and it is a reasonable thing .,technology
you think what the brain do doe do a lot of computation .,technology
i think most of what you call computation is done by the cerebellum .,technology
this is one of the thing that people do not much mention .,technology
i am going to come to this subject from the outside and certain thing strike me which you hardly ever hear mentioned .,technology
you heard mentioned about the left business thing .,technology
you move your arm thats your left side of the brain .,technology
and i am all that stuff .,technology
and it is more than that if you have this plot of different part of the brain there are two of these thing called the homoncular which these picture of a distorted human figure and showing different part of the brain controlling different part of the body .,technology
and it is not simply thing the hand is controlled and sense both sensory and motor on the left side left hand on the side .,technology
it is more than that .,technology
vision is at the back .,technology
your foot at the top .,technology
and since it is about the worst organization you are going to make them. . it can not be a mistake in nature .,technology
there something going on there .,technology
and this is made more pronounced when you think of the cerebellum .,technology
and cerebellum ha when i wa first thinking about these thing i this told it had half a many neuron or something that .,technology
and now they tell me it is got far more neuron than the cere the cerebrum .,technology
the cerebrum is this convoluted thing at the top .,technology
people will be talking about .,technology
cerebellum is this thing .,technology
shes a bit a ball of wool. . it is the back underneath .,technology
it is got more connection .,technology
computationally it is got much more going on .,technology
and this from this cerebrum .,technology
but a far a we know it is slightly controversial .,technology
cerebellum is entirely unconscious .,technology
the action you have are it is a pianist who can play a an incredible piece of music and think of any move this little finger into this little key to get a hit it the moment .,technology
doe he or she consciously will that movement ?,technology
the consciousness is coming in .,technology
it is probably to do with a feeling of the piece of music .,technology
this is being performed in that thing which is going on .,technology
but the detail and whats going on are controlled .,technology
i would think almost entirely by the cerebellum .,technology
thats where you have this precision and the detailed .,technology
once you get you think of a tennis player or something .,technology
doe that tennis player think exactly how the which muscle should be moved in what direction is enough ?,technology
of course not .,technology
but he or she will maybe think if the ball is angle in such a way and that corner that will be tricky for the opponent .,technology
and the detail of that are all done largely with the cerebellum .,technology
thats where well have precise motion .,technology
but it is unconscious .,technology
why is it interesting to you that much computation is done in the cerebellum and yet is unconscious ?,technology
because it is the view that somehow it is computation which is producing the consciousness .,technology
and it is here you have an incredible amount of computation going on .,technology
and a far a we know it is completely unconscious .,technology
why whats the difference ?,technology
and i think it is an important thing .,technology
whats the difference ?,technology
why is the cerebellum ?,technology
but all this very peculiar stuff that very hard to see on a computational perspective having the everything have to cross over under the other size and do something which look completely inefficient .,technology
and youve got funny thing the frontal lobe and the what a pretire what do we call the lobe ?,technology
and the place where they come together you have the different part the control .,technology
one to do with motor and the other to do with sensory .,technology
and there opposite each other rather than being connected by a new but it is not though youve got the electrical circuit .,technology
there something else going on there .,technology
it is the idea that it is a complicated computer seems to me to be completely missing the point .,technology
there must be a lot of computation going on .,technology
but the cerebellum seems to be much better at doing that than the cerebellum is .,technology
for sure i think what explains it is it is half hope and half we do not know whats going on and therefore from the computer science perspective you hope that a touring machine can be perfectly and achieve general intelligence .,technology
you have this wonderful thing about during and gertal and church and cary and various people particularly touring .,technology
and i guess post wa the other one .,technology
these people who developed the idea of what a computation is .,technology
and there were different idea of what a computer developed differently .,technology
i have a church a ive done it .,technology
it wa very different from touring .,technology
but then they were shown to be equivalent .,technology
and the view emerged that what we mean by a computation is a very clear concept .,technology
and one of the wonderful thing that touring did wa to show that you could have what we call the universal touring machine .,technology
you have to have a certain finite device .,technology
it ha to have an unlimited storage space which is accessible to it .,technology
but the actual computation if you is performed by this one universal device .,technology
and the view come away .,technology
you have this universal touring machine .,technology
and maybe the brain is something that .,technology
the universal touring machine and it is got maybe not an unlimited storage but a huge storage accessible through it .,technology
and this model is one which is whats used in ordinary computation .,technology
thats a very powerful model .,technology
and the universalness of computation is very useful .,technology
you can have some problem and you may not see immediately how to put it onto a computer .,technology
if it is something of that nature then how there were subprogram and subretains were normally i learned a little bit of computing when i wa a student but not very much .,technology
but it wa enough to get the general idea .,technology
and there something pleasant about a formal system that .,technology
where you can start discussing about whats approval whats not these kind of thing .,technology
and youve got a notion which is an absolute notion this notion of computability .,technology
and the unitability .,technology
it rest when thing mathematical problem are computably solvable and much are not .,technology
it is a very beautiful area of mathematics .,technology
and it is a very powerful area of mathematics .,technology
and it underlies the whole i will not say about the principle of computing machine that we have today .,technology
could you say what is gator and compliteness theorem and how doe it maybe also say is it heartbreaking to you ?,technology
and how doe it interfere with this notion of computation ?,technology
and it is not consciousness .,technology
the idea is idea which i formulated and my first year a a graduate student in cambridge .,technology
i did my undergraduate work in mathematics in london .,technology
and i had a colleague in person we used to discus thing computational and logical system quite a lot .,technology
id heard about gator theorem id have been worried by the idea that it seemed to say there were thing in mathematics that you could never prove .,technology
and when i went to cambridge a a graduate student i went to various course .,technology
i wa doing pure mathematics .,technology
i wa sort a little bit different from my superversion people .,technology
but it wa an algebraic geometry .,technology
and i wa interested i got particularly interested in three lecture course that were nothing to do with what i wa supposed to be doing .,technology
one wa a course by hermann bundy on einstein general theory of relativity which wa a beautiful course .,technology
he wa an amazing lecturer .,technology
brought these thing alive absolutely .,technology
and now there wa a course on quantum mechanic given by the great physicist paul dirac very beautiful course in a completely different way .,technology
it wa very organized and never got excited about anything seemingly .,technology
but it wa extremely put together and i found that amazing too .,technology
third course it wa nothing to do with what i should be doing wa a course on mathematical logic .,technology
and i got a i say my discussion with the impertible .,technology
wa the incomplete and sterome already deeply within mathematical logic space ?,technology
were you introduced in detail by the course by stine ?,technology
and it wa two thing he described which were very fundamental to my understanding .,technology
one wa two machine and the whole idea of computability and all that .,technology
that wa all very much part of the course .,technology
the other one wa the girl of the era .,technology
and it wasnt what i wa afraid it wa to tell you there were thing in mathematics you couldnt prove .,technology
it wa and he phrased it in a way which often people did not .,technology
and if you read douglas hofstadis book he doesnt .,technology
but stine made it very clear .,technology
and also in a public lecture that he gave to a mathematical i think maybe the adam society one of the the mathematical undergraduate society .,technology
and he made this point again very clearly that if youve got a formal system of proof .,technology
suppose what you mean by proof is something which you could check with a computer .,technology
to say whether youve got it or not youve got a lot of step .,technology
have you carried this computational procedure ?,technology
following the proof step of the proof correctly that can be checked by an algorithm by a computer .,technology
thats the key thing .,technology
now what you have to now is this any good ?,technology
if youve got an algorithmic system which claim to say yes this is this youve proved it correctly this is true .,technology
if youve proved it if you made it mistake it doesnt say it is true or false but if you have if youve done it then the conclusion youve come to is correct .,technology
now you say why do you believe it is correct ?,technology
because you looked at the rule and you said that one all .,technology
yeah that one all .,technology
what about that ?,technology
i see what it is all . . you go through all the rule .,technology
you say yes following those rule if it say yes it is true it is true .,technology
youve got to make sure that these rule are one that you trust .,technology
is if you follow the rule and it say it is a proof is the result true ?,technology
and that your belief that it is true depends upon looking at the rule and understanding them .,technology
now what girl or show that if you have such a system then you can construct a statement of the very kind that it is supposed to look at a mathematical statement .,technology
and you can see by the way it is constructed and what it mean that it is true but not proveable by the rule that youve been given .,technology
and it depends on your trust in the rule .,technology
do you believe that the rule only give you truth ?,technology
if you believe the rule only give you truth then you believe this other statement is also true .,technology
i found this absolutely mindblowing .,technology
when i saw this it blew my mind .,technology
but my god you can see that this statement is true .,technology
it is a good a any proof because it only depends on your belief in the reliability of the proof procedure .,technology
thats all it is .,technology
and understanding that the coding is done correctly and it enables you to transcend that system .,technology
whatever system you have a long a you can understand what it is doing and why you believe it only give you truth then you can see beyond that system .,technology
how do beyond it ?,technology
what is it ?,technology
it enables you to transcend that system .,technology
it is your understanding of what the system is saying and what the statement that youve constructed is staying .,technology
it is this quality of understanding whatever it is which is not governed by rule .,technology
it is not a computational procedure .,technology
this idea of understanding is now going to be within the rule of the within the formal system .,technology
yes that come from a rule .,technology
that come from a rule .,technology
anyway because you have understood them to be rule which only give you truth .,technology
there be no pointing it otherwise .,technology
i am going to people say this say once that the rule is good a any other way it is not true .,technology
you say you have to understand what the rule mean .,technology
and why doe that understanding of the mean ?,technology
give you something beyond the rule themselves .,technology
and thats what it wa .,technology
thats what blew my mind .,technology
it somehow thats adding why the rule give you truth enables you to transcend the rule .,technology
thats where even at that time thats already where the thought entered your mind that the idea of understanding or we can start calling it thing intelligence or even consciousness is outside the rule .,technology
yes since ive always concentrated on understanding people say people sometimes point out thing we know what our creativity thats something a machine can not do is create .,technology
what is creativity ?,technology
and i do not know .,technology
somebody can put some funny thing on a piece of paper and say thats creative .,technology
and you could make a machine do that .,technology
you say i am worried about that one .,technology
i agree with it in a sense but it is hard to do anything with that statement .,technology
you can make go see that understanding whatever it is .,technology
and it is very hard to put your finger on it .,technology
thats absolutely true .,technology
can you try to define or maybe dance around a definition of understanding ?,technology
to some degree but i do not i often wonder about this but there is something there which is very slippery .,technology
it is something standing back .,technology
and it is got to be something it is also got to be something which wa a value to our remote ancestor .,technology
because sometimes there a cartoon which i drew sometimes showing you how all these there a in the foreground .,technology
this mathematician doing some mathematical theorem .,technology
there a little bit different joke in that into that .,technology
he tried to prove some theorem .,technology
and he about to be eaten by a saboteuse tiger who hiding in the underground .,technology
and in the distance his cousin building growing crop building shelter domesticating animal .,technology
and in this type of foreground they build a mammoth trap and this coral mammoth is falling into a pit .,technology
and all these people around them are about to grab him .,technology
and those are the one who the quality of understanding which go with all it is not the mathematician doing his mathematics .,technology
this understanding quality is something else which is being a tremendous advantage to u not to u . see i do not think consciousness is limited to human .,technology
thats the interesting question at which point if it is indeed connected to the evolutionary process at which point did we pick up this very hard question ?,technology
it is certainly i do not think it is primate these picture of african hunting dog and how they can plan amongst themselves how to catch the antelope .,technology
some of these david attenborough film i think it is probably wa one of them .,technology
and you can see the hunting dog and they divide themselves into two group and they go into root two different root .,technology
one of them go and they hide next to the river .,technology
and the other group go around and they start yelping at these then embark i guess what if a noise hunting dog do ?,technology
the antelope and they round them up and they chase them in the direction of the river .,technology
and they are the other one waiting for them to get because when they get to the river it slows them down .,technology
and they plant on them .,technology
theyve obviously planned this all out .,technology
somehow i have no idea how .,technology
and there is some element of conscious planning a far a i can see i do not think it is some much of ai these day is done i wonder what they call bottomup system .,technology
and that doesnt feel understanding .,technology
and there no understanding and that whatsoever .,technology
while you are being a little bit human centric i am going to talk about yeah not with the dog ever .,technology
i say not human centric but i am in spoke by a lot by a logic centric .,technology
is it possible that consciousness would look slightly different ?,technology
i am not saying it is biological because we do not know .,technology
i think other example of the elephant is a wonderful example too .,technology
where they this wa i think this wa an item for one .,technology
where the elephant ha to go from the long the trooper and have to go long distance .,technology
and the leader of a trooper is a female .,technology
they all are apparently .,technology
and this female that she had to go all the way from one part of the country to another .,technology
and a a certain point she made a detour and they went off in this big detour .,technology
all the trooper came with her and this wa where her sister had died .,technology
and there were her bone lying around and they go and pick up the bone and they hand it around and they caress the bone .,technology
and then they put them back and they will go back again .,technology
what do we have now they are doing ?,technology
thats a lot of interesting .,technology
there something going on .,technology
there no clear connection with natural selection .,technology
there some deep feeling going on there .,technology
we have to do with their conscious experience .,technology
and i think it is something that you overall have advantage .,technology
i am not a trocese election but not directly to do with natural selection .,technology
i that there something going on going on there .,technology
i told you i am russian i tend to romanticise all thing of this nature that that is not merely cold hard computation .,technology
perhaps i could lightly answer your question .,technology
you were asking me what is it ?,technology
there something about standing back and thinking about your and thought process .,technology
and there is something that in the gut or thing because it is you are not following the rule .,technology
you are standing back and thinking about the rule .,technology
and there is something that you might say you think about you are doing something .,technology
anything what the hell am i doing ?,technology
and you stand back and think about what it is thats making you think such a way .,technology
take a step back outside this the game youve been playing .,technology
yeah you are back up and you think about you are not playing the game anymore .,technology
you are thinking about what the hell you are doing in playing this game .,technology
and thats somehow it is not a very precise discovery but somehow feel very true that thats somehow understanding this reflection .,technology
the reflection yes .,technology
there is a bit hard to put your finger on but there is something there which i think maybe could be unearthed at some point and see this is whats going on .,technology
why conscious being have this advantage ?,technology
what it is that give them advantage .,technology
and i think it go way back .,technology
i do not think we are talking about the hunting dog and the elephant .,technology
thats pretty clear that octopus is the same quality .,technology
and we call it consciousness .,technology
yeah i think .,technology
it is seen enough example of the way that they behave and the evolution route is completely different .,technology
thats a good way back to some common ancestor or did it come separately .,technology
my hope is that something simple but the hard question if there a hardware prerequisite we have to develop some hardware mechanism in our computer .,technology
a you suggest well get to in a second we have to throw away the computer we know today .,technology
the deterministic machine we know today that try to create it .,technology
my hope of course is not but when i see i should go back to the story which in a sense i havent finished because i went to these three course .,technology
when i wa a graduate student .,technology
and i started to think i am i am a pretty what you might call a materialist in the sense of thinking that there no mystical or something around it which come in from boonos where you still that you still throw your life in a mental form .,technology
i do not the word materialist because it is we know what material is .,technology
and thats that is a bad word because there no mystical .,technology
it is not something which is not not treatable by science .,technology
it is beautifully put a pause in there for a second .,technology
your materialist but you acknowledge that we do not know what the materialist .,technology
i to call myself a scientist thats the most but it mean that yes the question go on here .,technology
i began thinking if consciousness or understanding is something which is not a computational process what can it be ?,technology
and i knew enough from my undergraduate work i knew about newtonian mechanic and i knew how you could put it on a computer .,technology
there is a fundamental issue which is it is important or not that computation depends upon discrete thing .,technology
you are using discrete element whereas the physical law is dependent on the continuum .,technology
is this something to do with it ?,technology
is it the fact that we are used to continuum in our physic ?,technology
and if we model our physical system or used to discrete system ordinary computer i came to the view that thats probably not it .,technology
i might have to retract on that someday but the view wa you can get close enough .,technology
it is not all together clear i have to say but you can get close enough .,technology
and it is a very impressive piece of computational work how you can work out the shape of those signal .,technology
and now we have seeing these signal .,technology
and they say yeah there a black hole spiral into each other .,technology
this is a vindication of the power of computation in describing and sound general activity .,technology
in that case we can get close .,technology
but we the the the wood computation we can get close to understanding the physic .,technology
you can get very close .,technology
now is that close enough ?,technology
and then i went to this course by dirak .,technology
now i think it wa the very first lecture that he gave and he wa talking about the superposition principle .,technology
and he said if you have a particle you usually think of particle can be over here or over there but in quantum mechanic it can be over here and over there at the same time .,technology
and you have these state which involve a superposition in some sense of it different location for that particle .,technology
and then you go out at his piece of chalk .,technology
some people say brok it in two is a illustration of how the piece of chalk might be over here and over there at the same time .,technology
and he wa talking about this and i my mind wandered .,technology
i do not remember what he said .,technology
i can remember he moved on to the next topic .,technology
and something about energy hed mentioned which i have no idea what hed had to do with anything .,technology
and id been struck with this and worried about it ever since .,technology
it is probably a . i did not hear his explanation because it wa probably one of these thing to calm me down and not worry about it anymore .,technology
whereas in my case ive worried about it ever since .,technology
i thought maybe thats the catch .,technology
there is something in quantum mechanic .,technology
where these superposition become one or the other .,technology
and thats not part of quantum mechanic .,technology
there something missing in the theory .,technology
the theory is incomplete .,technology
it is not incomplete .,technology
because if you follow the equation the basic equation of quantum mechanic thats routing the equation .,technology
you could put that on a computer too .,technology
there are lot of difficulty about how many parameter you have to put in .,technology
that can be very tricky .,technology
but nevertheless it is a computational process .,technology
margie lowe this question about the continuum thats before but it is not clear that make any difference .,technology
our theory of quantum mechanic may be missing the same element that the universal term machine is missing about consciousness .,technology
yeah this is the viewer i held is that you need a theory .,technology
and that what on people call the reduction of the stage or the collapse of the wave function which you have to have otherwise quantum mechanic doesnt relate to the world we see .,technology
to make it relate to the world we see youve got to break the quantum youve got to break the shroening of the equation .,technology
shroening himself wa absolutely followed by this idea .,technology
his own equation .,technology
thats why introduced this famous shroening a cat .,technology
there a thought experiment .,technology
he saying look this is where my equation lead you into it .,technology
there something wrong .,technology
something we havent understood which is fundamental .,technology
and i wa trying to put all these thing together and said it is got to be the noncompetitive community come in there .,technology
and i also can not quite remember when i thought this but it is when gravity is involved in quantum mechanic .,technology
it is the combination of those two and at that point when you have good reason to believe this came much later .,technology
but i have good reason to believe that the principle of general relativity and those of quantum mechanic most particularly it is the basic principle of equivalence which go back to galileo .,technology
if you fall freely you eliminate the gravitational field .,technology
you imagine galileo dropping his big rock and his little rock from the leaning tower whether he ever did that or not it is pretty irrelevant .,technology
and a the rock fall to the ground youll have a little insect sitting on one of them looking at the other one .,technology
and it seems to think there no gravity here .,technology
of course it hit the ground and then it realized somethings different going on .,technology
but when it is in free fall the gravity is been eliminated .,technology
galileo understood that very beautifully .,technology
he give his wonderful example of firework .,technology
and the firework and explode and the sphere of sparkling firework and it remains a fear a it fall down a though there were no gravity .,technology
he understood that principle but he couldnt make a theory out of it .,technology
einstein came along used exactly the same principle and thats the basis of einstein general theory of relativity .,technology
now there is a conflict this is something i did not much much later this wasnt those day much much later .,technology
you can see there is a basic conflict between the principle of superposition i think that drag wa talking about and the principle of general cove and principle of equivalence .,technology
can you pause for a second what is the principle of the cove line ?,technology
it is this galileo principle that we can eliminate least locally .,technology
you have to be in a small neighborhood because if you have people dropping rock all around the world somewhere you can not get rid of it all at once .,technology
but in the local neighborhood you can eliminate the gravitational field by falling freely with it .,technology
and we now see there with astronaut and they do not the earth is there you can see the great global vrthrite but they do not care about it a far a they are concerned there no gravity .,technology
they fall freely in the gravitational field and that get rid of the gravitational field .,technology
and thats the principle of equivalence .,technology
whats the contradiction whats the tension whats the tension whats the supposition and let go to the next one .,technology
we a bad track for a second to see if we can weave a thread through it all .,technology
we started to think about consciousness a potentially needing u some of the same not mystical but some of the same imagine .,technology
there a complicated story .,technology
people think i am drifting away from the point or something but i think it is a complicated story .,technology
what i am trying to say i am trying to put it in a nutshell it is not easy .,technology
i am trying to say that whatever consciousness is it is not a computation .,technology
or it is not a physical process which can be described by computation .,technology
but it nevertheless could be one of the interesting model that youve proposed is the orchestrated objective reduction which is thats going from there you say .,technology
i wrote this book through my scientific career .,technology
i thought when i am retired i have enough time to write a a popular book which i will explain my idea and puzzle .,technology
what i beautiful thing about physic and mathematics and this puzzle about computability and consciousness and on .,technology
and in the process of writing this book i thought id do it when i wa retired .,technology
i did not i wouldnt wait that long because there wa a radio discussion between edward fredkin and marvin minsky .,technology
and they were talking about what computer could do and they were entering a big room and i imagine entering a big room with the other end of the room two computer were talking to each other .,technology
and a you walk up to the computer they will have communicated to each other more idea concept thing than the entire human race had ever commuted that .,technology
i thought i know you are coming from but i do not believe you .,technology
there something missing .,technology
thats not that i thought i should write my book .,technology
it wa roughly the same time stephen hawking this writing his brief history of time and 80 at some point .,technology
the book youve talked about wa the emperor new york .,technology
and both are an incredible book the brief history of time in emperor new mind .,technology
yes it wa quite interesting because he told me hed got some carl sagan i think to write a forward .,technology
good the book i thought gosh what am i going to do ?,technology
he did and he did a very nice forward .,technology
it wa my thinking i see where they are coming from and i from that perspective .,technology
yeah you are but thats not my perspective .,technology
i thought i had to say it .,technology
and a i wa writing my book i thought i do not know anything about neurophysiology .,technology
what am i doing ?,technology
i started reading up about neurophysiology and i read how i am not trying to find out how it is that nerve signal could possibly preserve quantum coherence .,technology
and all i read is that the sit and electrical signal which go along the nerve create effect through the brain .,technology
there no chance you can isolate it .,technology
this is hopeless .,technology
i come to the end of the book and i am more or le give up .,technology
i think of something which i did not believe in .,technology
thats maybe this is a way around it but no .,technology
and then you say i thought maybe this book at least stimulate young people who do science or something .,technology
and i got all these letter from old retired people instead .,technology
there not only people who could have had time to read my book .,technology
except for stuart hammer off .,technology
thats except for stuart hammer .,technology
stuart hammer off wrote to me and he said i think you are missing something .,technology
you do not know about my criterion .,technology
but that wa more or le it .,technology
and he said this is what you need to consider .,technology
i thought my god .,technology
yes thats a much more promising structure .,technology
fundamentally you were searching for the source of noncomputable source of consciousness within the human brain in the biology .,technology
and what are my if i may ask what are my curtubials ?,technology
i wa ignorant and what id read .,technology
i never came across them in the book .,technology
it looked at .,technology
perhaps i only read rather superficially which is true .,technology
but i know about my criterion .,technology
stuart i think one of the thing here wa impressed him about them .,technology
when picture of my toses thats a cell divide it .,technology
and all the chromosome .,technology
and the chromosome get they are all get line up and then they get pulled apart .,technology
and that a the cell divide the half the chromosome go how they are divided into the two path .,technology
and they go two different way .,technology
and what is it thats pulling them apart ?,technology
the host of these social thing got microtubials .,technology
and he start to get interested in them .,technology
and he formed the view when he wa and his day job or night job or whatever because it put people to sleep except he doesnt calling the sleep because it is different .,technology
general anesthetic in a reversible way .,technology
you want to make sure that they do not experience the pain that with other word be something that they feel .,technology
and consciousness is turned off for a while and it can be turned back on again .,technology
it is crucial that you can turn it off and turn it on .,technology
and what do you do when you are doing that ?,technology
what do general anesthetic gas do ?,technology
and see he formed the view that it is the microtubials the effect .,technology
and the detail of why he formed that view is not what the clever clear to me but there an interesting story he keep talking about .,technology
but i found this very exciting because i thought these structure these little tube which inhabit pretty ourselves .,technology
apart from red blood cell they inhabit pretty all the other cell in the body .,technology
but they are not all the same kind .,technology
you get different kind of microtubials .,technology
and the one that excited me the most this is may still not be clear .,technology
but the one that excited me most were the one that the only one that i knew about at the time because they were the very very symmetrical structure .,technology
and i had reason to believe that these very symmetrical structure would be much better at preserving a quantum state quantum coherence preserving the thing without you need to preserve certain degree of freedom without them leaking into the environment .,technology
once they leak into the environment you are lost .,technology
you have to preserve these quantum state at a level which the state reduction process come in .,technology
and thats where i think the norm of computeability come in .,technology
and it is the measurement process in quantum mechanic .,technology
whats going on ?,technology
something about the measure of process and whats going on something about the structure or the microtubials your intuition say maybe there something here .,technology
maybe this structure allows for the the mystery of the there wa a much better chance .,technology
yeah it struck me that partly it wa the symmetry because there is a feature of symmetry you can preserve quantum coherence much better with symmetrical structure .,technology
there that there is a good reason for that .,technology
and that impressed me a lot .,technology
i did not know the difference between the alighters and blighter at that time which could be important .,technology
now that could be thats the which is not talked about but thats some in some sense detail .,technology
weve got to take a step back to say these people are not familiar .,technology
this this this wa called the orchestrated objective reduction idea or or or which is a biological philosophy of mine that postulate the consciousness originates at the quantum level it is a neuron .,technology
that ha to do with your search for where where is it coming from .,technology
thats counter to the notion that consciousness may arise from the computation performed by the synapsis .,technology
yes the key point .,technology
sometimes people say it is because it is quantum mechanical .,technology
it is not that .,technology
see it is more outrageous than that .,technology
this is one reason i think we are far off from it because we do not even know the physic .,technology
people say quantum system and biological structure no will you ?,technology
it is starting to see that some basic biological system doe depend on quantum in first place all of chemistry is quantum mechanic .,technology
people got used to that they do not count that .,technology
it is not count let not count quantum chemistry .,technology
we got the hang of that i think .,technology
but you have quantum effect which are not chemical in photosynthesis .,technology
and this is one of the striking thing in the last several year that photosynthesis seems to be a quantum process which is not simply a chemical .,technology
it is using quantum mechanic in a very basic way .,technology
you could start saying with photosynthesis based on quantum mechanic why not behavior of neuron and thing that ?,technology
maybe there something which is photosynthesis in that respect .,technology
but what i am saying is even more outrageous than that because those thing are talking about conventional quantum mechanic .,technology
now my argument say that conventional quantum mechanic if you are following the shortening of equation thats still computable .,technology
youve got to go beyond that .,technology
youve got to go to where quantum mechanic go wrong in a certain sense .,technology
you have to be a little bit careful about that because the way people do quantum mechanic is a mixture of two different process .,technology
one of them is the schrodinger equation which is an equation a schrodinger wrote down and it tell you how the state of assistant evolves .,technology
in his evolved according to his equation completely deterministic but it involves interredicular situation .,technology
and this wa what schrodinger wa very much pointing out with his cat .,technology
he say you follow my equation thats schrodinger equation and you could say that you have to you have a cat a cat which is dead in the live at the same time .,technology
that would be the evolution of the schrodinger equation but lead to a state which is the quick cat being dead under the live at the same time .,technology
and he more or le saying this is an absurdity .,technology
people nowadays say what schrodinger said you can have a cat which is dead let not let see he wa saying this is an absurdity .,technology
there something missing and that the reduction of the state or the collapse of the wave function or whatever it is it is something which ha to be understood .,technology
it is not following the schrodinger equation .,technology
it is not the way we conventionally do quantum mechanic .,technology
there something more than that and it is easy to quote or authority here because einstein at least three of the greatest physicist of 20th century who were very fundamental in developing quantum mechanic einstein one of them schrodinger and other dirac and other .,technology
you have to look carefully dirac writing because he did not tend to say this out loud too much because he wa very cautious about what he said .,technology
you find the place and he say quantum mechanic is a provisional theory .,technology
to be need something which explains the collapse of the wave function .,technology
we need to go beyond the theory we have now .,technology
i happen to be one of the kind of people there many .,technology
there are a whole group of people .,technology
they are all considered to be bit bit neverix who believe that quantum mechanic need to be modified .,technology
there a small minority of those people which were a minority who think that the way in which it is modified ha to be with gravity .,technology
and there is not even a small amount of diversity of those people who think it is particularly the way that i think it is .,technology
those are the quantum gravity folk .,technology
whats what ?,technology
quantum gravity is already not this because when you say quantum gravity what you mean is quantum mechanic applied to gravitational theory .,technology
let take this wonderful formalism of quantum mechanic and make gravity fit into it .,technology
that is what quantum gravity is meant to be .,technology
now i am saying youve got to be more even handed that gravity affect the structure of quantum mechanic too .,technology
youve got to gravitate quantum mechanic and it is a two way thing .,technology
it wa then when you even get started that you are saying that we have to figure out a new idea .,technology
no it is your stock and have a theory .,technology
thats the trouble .,technology
this is a big problem .,technology
we are watching here .,technology
we are maybe in the very early day .,technology
it is in the very early day .,technology
but i making this point .,technology
if you still have a rough sense to be penrose say that it is got to be a reduction of the state .,technology
the trouble is penrose doesnt say that penrose say i think that .,technology
and then we have no we have no experiment a yet which showed it is that .,technology
there are experiment which are being thought through and which i am hoping will be performed .,technology
if you do not bring in the gravitational effect it ha to be modified .,technology
and then there also experiment that are underway that look at the microtubile side of thing to see if there in the biology .,technology
you could see something that .,technology
could you briefly mention it ?,technology
because thats a one of the only experimental attempt in the very early day of even thinking about u . i think there a very serious area here which is what stuart hemmerff is doing and i think it is very important .,technology
one of the few place that you can get a bit of a handle on what consciousness is is what turn it off .,technology
and when you are thinking about general anesthetic it is very specific .,technology
these thing turn consciousness off .,technology
what the hell do they do ?,technology
stuart and a number of people who work with him and others happen to believe that the general anesthetic directly affect microtubiles .,technology
and there is some evidence for this .,technology
i do not know how strong it is and how watertight the case but i think that it is some evidence pointing in that direction .,technology
it is not an ordinary chemical process there something quite different about it .,technology
and one of the main candidate is that these anesthetic gas do affect directly microtubiles .,technology
and how strong that evidence is i wouldnt be in a position to say but i think there is fairly impressive evidence .,technology
in the point is the experiment are being undertaken which is that is experimental .,technology
it say it is a very clear direction where you can think of experiment which could indicate whether or not it is microtubiles which is the anesthetic gas directly effect .,technology
thats exciting .,technology
one of the sad thing is a far a i am from my outside perspective it is not many people are working on this .,technology
there a very a stuart it feel there very few people are carrying the flag forward on this .,technology
i think it is not many in the sense it is in minority but it is not zero anymore .,technology
when stuart and i were originally we were u and a few of our friend they werent many people telling u but it is grown into one of the main viewpoint .,technology
there might be about four or five or six different news that people hold and it is wonderful .,technology
it is considered a one of the possible line of thinking yes .,technology
you describe physic theory a falling into one or three category .,technology
the superb the useful or the tentative .,technology
i those word .,technology
it is a beautiful categorization .,technology
do you think well ever have a superb theory of intelligence and of consciousness ?,technology
we are a long way from it .,technology
i do not think we are even we are in the tentative scale .,technology
it is you do not think we even entered the realm of tentative .,technology
probably not .,technology
i think thats the race .,technology
when the controversial we do not have a clear view which is accepted by majority .,technology
most view are computationally one form or another .,technology
i think it is something but it is not very clear because even the iit people who think of thing this computation but ive heard them say no consciousness is supposed to be not computation .,technology
i say if it is not coming it wouldnt hell is it ?,technology
whats going on ?,technology
what physical process are going on which are that ?,technology
what is immune for something to be computationally then ?,technology
is where there ha to be a process which is it is very curious the way the history ha developed in quantum mechanic because very early on people thought there wa something to do with consciousness but it wa almost the other way around .,technology
you have to say the the schrodinger equation say all these different alternative happen all at once and then when is it that only one of them happens ?,technology
one of the view which wa quite commonly held by a few distinguished quantum physicist this way of conscious being look at the system or becomes aware of it and at that point it becomes one of the other .,technology
thats a row where consciousness is somehow actively reducing the state .,technology
my view is almost the exact opposite of that .,technology
it is the state reduces itself in some way which some noncomputational way which we do not understand we do not have a proper theory of and that is a building block of what consciousness is .,technology
consciousness is the other way around .,technology
it depends on that choice which nature make all the time when the state becomes one of the other rather than the superstition of one and the other and when that happens there is that we are saying now an element of protoconsciousness take place .,technology
protoconsciousness is roughly speaking the building block out of which actual consciousness is constructed .,technology
you have these protoconscious element which are when the state decides to will not do one thing or the other and thats the thing which when organized together .,technology
and it might be something thats beautifully simple but we are completely in the dark about .,technology
yeah i think at the moment it is thats the thing we happily put the word ork down there to say orchestrated but thats even more unclear what that mean .,technology
it is the word material orchestrated yes we know .,technology
and weve been dancing a little bit between the word intelligence or understanding in consciousness .,technology
do you see those sitting in the same space of mystery a we are supposed to say ?,technology
yes we see i tend to say you have understanding and intelligence and awareness .,technology
and somehow understanding is in the middle of it ?,technology
i to say could you say are there an entity that is intelligent if it doesnt have the quality of understanding ?,technology
make sure i am using term i do not even know how to define with who care .,technology
there some cool there some work poetic if i somehow understand them .,technology
we do not know mathematical nature .,technology
yes a a mathematician i do not know how to define any of them but at least i can point to the connection .,technology
the idea is intelligence is something which i believe need understanding .,technology
otherwise you wouldnt say it is intelligence .,technology
and understanding need awareness .,technology
otherwise you wouldnt say it is understanding .,technology
do you say of an entity that understands something ?,technology
and unless it is aware of it normal usage .,technology
there a three awareness understanding and intelligence .,technology
and i tend to concentrate on understanding because thats where i can say something .,technology
and thats the girl theorem thing that .,technology
but i wonder what doe it mean to be perceived the color blue or something ?,technology
is it the same ?,technology
if i see a color blue and it if you are somebody with this condition whats it called ?,technology
or were you assigned a sound to a color blue ?,technology
yeah thats not you get color and sound mixed up .,technology
and that thing .,technology
an interesting subject .,technology
but from the physic perspective from the fundamental perspective we do not .,technology
i think we are way off and having much understanding whats going on there .,technology
in your two thousand and ten book cycle of time you suggest that another universe may have existed before the big bang .,technology
can you describe this idea ?,technology
first of all what is the big bang ?,technology
sound a funny word .,technology
and what may have been there before it ?,technology
yes a a matter of terminology i do not to call it another universe .,technology
because when you have another universe you think of it quite separate from u . but these thing they are not separate .,technology
now the big bang conventional theory i wa growing up in the sense that when i started getting justin cosmology there wa something called the steady state model which wa philosophically very interesting .,technology
and there wasnt a big bang in that theory .,technology
but somehow new material wa created all the time in the form of hydrogen and the universe kept on expanding expanding expanding and there wa room for more hydrogen .,technology
it wa a rather philosophically nice picture .,technology
it wa disproved when the big bang when i said a big bang this wa theoretically discovered by people trying to solve einstein equation and apply it to cosmology .,technology
he liked and i a universe which wa there all the time .,technology
and he had a model which there wa there all the time .,technology
but then there wa this discovery accidental discovery very important discovery on this microwave background .,technology
and if you there the crackle on your television screen which is already sensing this microwave background which is coming at u from all direction .,technology
and you can trace it back and back and back and back and it came from a very early stage of the universe .,technology
it is part of the big bang theory .,technology
the big bang theory wa when people tried to solve einstein equation .,technology
they found you had to have this initial state .,technology
the universe it wa used to be called the primordial atom and thing this .,technology
there friedman and lemetra .,technology
friedman wa a russian and lemetra wa the belgian and they independently were friedman first .,technology
lemetra talked about the initial state which used to be very very concentrated .,technology
and this wa state which seemed to be the origin of the universe .,technology
from a module atom .,technology
primordial atom is what he called it .,technology
it wa a whole term .,technology
and then it became friend hoyle used to turn big bang in a derogatory sense .,technology
he said then with the shorting here in the cats. ?,technology
yeah it is pick pick pick up on whereas it wasnt intentional originally .,technology
but then the evidence piled up and piled up .,technology
and my one of my friend and i learned a lot from him .,technology
when i wa in cambridge i wa standing in a shower and he wa a very proponent of steady state .,technology
and then he got converted to said no i am sorry .,technology
i had a great respect for him .,technology
you went around lecturing said i wa wrong .,technology
the steady state model doesnt work .,technology
and this microwave background that it is not quite the big bang .,technology
when i said not quite it is about three hundred and eightyzero year after the big bang .,technology
but thats what .,technology
but then you have to have had this big bang before a in order to make the equation work .,technology
and it work beautifully .,technology
except for one little thing which is this thing called inflation which people had to put into it to make it work .,technology
when i first heard of it i did not it at all .,technology
whats inflation ?,technology
inflation is that in the first i am going to give you a very tiny number .,technology
think of a second .,technology
thats not very long .,technology
now i am going to give you a fraction of a second .,technology
one over a number .,technology
this number ha thirty two digit .,technology
between let say between thirty six and thirty two digit .,technology
tiny tiny time between those two tiny ridiculous second .,technology
fraction of a second .,technology
the universe wa supposed to have expanded in this exponential way .,technology
and in an almost way for no pattern parent reason you had to invent a particular thing called the inflation field to make it do it .,technology
and i thought this is completely crazy .,technology
there are reason why people stuck with this idea .,technology
the thing is that ive formed my model for reason which you are very fundamental if you .,technology
it ha to do this very fundamental principle which is known a the second law of thermodynamics .,technology
the second law of thermodynamics say more or le thing get more and more random a time go on .,technology
now another way of saying exactly the same thing is thing get le and le random .,technology
a thing go back a you go back in time they get le and le random .,technology
you go back and back and back and back and back .,technology
and the earliest thing you can directly see is this micro way back round .,technology
whats one of the most striking feature of it ?,technology
is that it is random ?,technology
it ha the what you call this spectrum of which is whats called the planck spectrum of frequency different intensity for different frequency .,technology
and this is wonderful curve due to max planck and whats to tell you is telling you that the entropy is a a maximum .,technology
start a often maximum and it is going up over since .,technology
i call that the mammoth in the room .,technology
and the mammoth in the and people quite do not cosmologist worry about this .,technology
i worry about it .,technology
and then i thought it is not a paradox because you are looking at matter and radiation at a maximum entropy state .,technology
once you are not seeing directly in that it is the gravitation .,technology
it is gravitation which is not thermalized .,technology
the gravitation wa very very low entropy .,technology
and it is low entropy by the uniformity .,technology
and that in the microwave too .,technology
it is very uniform over the host guy .,technology
i am compressing a long story into a very short twocent .,technology
and doing a great job yeah .,technology
what i am saying is that there a huge puzzle .,technology
why wa gravity in this very low entropy state very high organized state everything else wa all random ?,technology
and that to me there a biggest problem in cosmology .,technology
the biggest problem ?,technology
nobody think he worry about it .,technology
people say they solved all the problem and they do not even worry about it .,technology
they think inflation source .,technology
it can not .,technology
because it is it is it is a clever that that wa your problem with the inflation describing some aspect of the influence after the big bang .,technology
inflation wa supposed to stretch it out and make it all uniform .,technology
it doesnt do it because you can only do it if it is uniform already at the beginning .,technology
it is you have to look i can not go into the detail but it doesnt solve it .,technology
and it wa completely clear that it doesnt solve it .,technology
but where doe the conformal cyclic cosmology of yeah we are starting to talk about something before yes that singular .,technology
i began i wa thinking of myself how boring this universe is going to be .,technology
youve got this exponential expansion .,technology
this wa discovered early in the in this century twentyfirst century .,technology
people discovered that these supernova exploding star showed that the universe is undergoing this exponential expansion .,technology
it is a soft similar expansion .,technology
and it seems to be a feature of this term that einstein introduced into his cosmology for the wrong reason .,technology
he wanted a universe that wa static .,technology
he put this new term into his cosmology to make it make sense .,technology
it is called the cosmological constant .,technology
and then when he got convinced that the universe had a big bang he retracted it complaining that this wa his greatest problem .,technology
the trouble wa it wasnt a blender .,technology
and the universe seems to be behaving with this cosmological constant .,technology
this universe is expanding and expanding whats going to happen in the future ?,technology
he get more and more boring for a while .,technology
whats the most interesting thing in the universe ?,technology
this black hole .,technology
the black hole more or le gulp down in tower cluster of galaxy .,technology
the class itll swallow up most of our galaxy .,technology
we will run into our endrama the galaxy black hole .,technology
that black hole will swallow out one .,technology
theyll get bigger and bigger and theyll swallow out the whole cluster of galaxy .,technology
gulp it all down .,technology
most of it .,technology
most of it .,technology
thatll happen to it .,technology
therell be these black hole around .,technology
but still not a boring a it is going to get .,technology
it is going to get more boring because these black hole you wait wait and you wait and wait and i am not even willing for time .,technology
and hawking black hole of aberration start to come in .,technology
and the black hole you it is a clever tedious .,technology
finally evaporate away .,technology
each one go away disappears with a pop at the end .,technology
what could be more boring ?,technology
that it wa boring then .,technology
now this is boring .,technology
there nothing not even black hole .,technology
the universe get colder and colder and colder and colder and ever .,technology
this is very very boring .,technology
now there not science is it ?,technology
but it is emotional .,technology
i thought who going to be bored by this universe ?,technology
not u . we will not be around .,technology
itll be mostly photon running around .,technology
and what the photon do they do not get bored because it is part of relativity .,technology
it is not that they do not experience anything .,technology
thats not the point .,technology
the photon get out to infinity without experience any time .,technology
thats the way the way relativity work .,technology
and this wa part of what i used to do in my old day when i wa looking gravitational radiation and how thing behaved in infinity infinity is another place .,technology
you can squash it down a long a you do not have any mass in the world .,technology
infinity is another place .,technology
the photon get there .,technology
the graviton get there .,technology
what do they get ?,technology
theyve run into infinity .,technology
they say now i am here .,technology
what do i ?,technology
there something on the other side ?,technology
is there the usual view ?,technology
it is a mathematical notion .,technology
there nothing on the other side .,technology
thats the boundary of it .,technology
a nice example is this beautiful series of picture by the dutch artist mc escher .,technology
you may know them .,technology
the one called circle in it is very famous one with the angel and the devil .,technology
and you can see them crowding and crowding up to the edge .,technology
now the geometry that these angel and devil inhabit that stare infinity .,technology
but from our perspective infinity is a car .,technology
it is a place .,technology
it is a ... is there a can you take a brief pause ?,technology
and the word you are saying infinity is a place .,technology
for the most part infinity even going back to infinity is a mathematical concept .,technology
i think this is one of the thing that are actual physical metaphor .,technology
in which way doe infinity ever manifest itself in our physical universe ?,technology
it is a thing that if you are not a mathematician you think i am a finisher i can not think about that .,technology
mathematician think about infinity all the time .,technology
they get used to the idea and they play around with different kind of infinity and it becomes no problem .,technology
but yeah you have to take my word for it .,technology
now one of the thing is you take a youclose the enjormetry .,technology
it keep on geek on geek on going and it go out to infinity .,technology
now there other kind of geometry and this is a whats called hyperbolic geometry .,technology
it is a bit you clearly the enjormetry is a little bit different .,technology
it is what azure wa trying to describe in his angel and devil .,technology
and he learned about this from coxeter .,technology
and he think that very nice thing .,technology
i try to represent this infinity to this geometry .,technology
it is not quite you clearly enjormetry is a bit it that the angel and the devil inhabit .,technology
and there infinity by this nice transformation you squash the air infinity down you can draw it a this nice circle boundary to their universe .,technology
now from our outside perspective we can see their infinity a the boundary .,technology
now what i am saying is that it is very that .,technology
the infinity that we might experience those angel and devil in their world can be thought of a a boundary .,technology
now i found this a very useful way of talking about radiation gravitational radiation and thing that .,technology
it wa a trick mathematical trick .,technology
now what i am saying is that that mathematical trick becomes real .,technology
that somehow the photon they need to go somewhere because for there from their perspective infinity is another place .,technology
now this is a difficult idea to get your mind around .,technology
thats why i caused one of the reason because most the finding of the other trouble taking me .,technology
but to me it is not necessarily a wild idea .,technology
whats on the other side of that infinity ?,technology
you have to think why am i allowed to think of this ?,technology
because photon do not have any mass .,technology
and we in physic have beautiful way of measuring time .,technology
they are incredibly precise clock .,technology
atomic and nuclear clock unbelievably precise .,technology
why are they precise ?,technology
because of the two most famous equation of 20th century physic .,technology
one of them is einstein e equal mc squared .,technology
whats that tell u ?,technology
energy and mass are equivalent .,technology
the other one is even older than that .,technology
20th century only max plank e equal h new .,technology
new is a frequency .,technology
h is a constant again c. e is energy .,technology
put the two together .,technology
max plank put the two together .,technology
absolutely basic physical principle .,technology
if you have a massive entity a massive particle it is a clock with a very very precise frequency .,technology
it is not you can not directly use it .,technology
you have to scale it down your atomic and nuclear clock but thats the basic principle .,technology
you scale it down to some that you can perceive .,technology
but it is the same principle .,technology
if you have mass you have beautiful clock .,technology
but the other side of that coin is if you do not have mass you do not have clock .,technology
if you do not have clock you do not have ruler .,technology
you do not have space in time .,technology
you do not have a measure of the scale of space .,technology
scale of space .,technology
you have space .,technology
if you do have the structure that wa called the conformal structure it is what the angel level have .,technology
if you look at the eye of the devil no matter how close to the boundary it ha the same shape .,technology
but it ha a different size .,technology
you can scale up and you can scale down but you mustnt change the shape .,technology
it is the same idea but applied to space time .,technology
in the very remote future you have thing which do not measure the scale but the shape if you is still there .,technology
now thats in the remote future .,technology
now i am going to do the exact opposite .,technology
now a you get there thing go hotter and hotter denser and denser whats the universe dominated by ?,technology
particle moving around almost with the speed of light .,technology
when they get almost with the speed of light they begin to lose the mass too .,technology
they are for completely opposite reason .,technology
they lose the sense of scale a . my crazy idea is the big bang and the remote future they seem completely different .,technology
one is extremely dense extremely hot .,technology
the others very very rare if i am in very very cold .,technology
but if you squash one down by this conformist scale and you get the other .,technology
although they look and feel very different they are almost the same .,technology
the remote future on the other side and in claiming a that one of the photon go they go into the next big bang .,technology
youve got to get your mind around that crazy step on the other side of the place that is not funny. . i am saying the other side of our big bang .,technology
back back back .,technology
there wa the remote future of a previous eon .,technology
previously on .,technology
and what i am saying is that previous eon there are signal coming through to u which we can see and which we do see .,technology
and these are both signal .,technology
the two main signal are to do with black hole .,technology
one of them is the collision between black hole and a they spiral into each other they release a lot of energy in the form of gravitational wave .,technology
those gravitational wave get through in a certain form into the next eon .,technology
thats fascinating that there is some maybe i am maybe can correct me from wrong .,technology
but that mean that some information can travel from another eon .,technology
that is fascinating .,technology
ive seen some where described the discussion of the fermi paradox that if there intelligent life yes communication immediately take you there .,technology
my colleague vahegozajan who i work with on this idea for a while we have a crazy paper on that .,technology
look at the family paradox .,technology
yes. . if the universe is cycling over and over and over punctuated by the punctuated the singularity the big bang .,technology
and then intelligent or any intelligent system can communicate through from eon to eon .,technology
why havent we heard anything from our friend ?,technology
because we do not know how to look .,technology
thats fundamentally the reason .,technology
a we i do not know it is speculation .,technology
the setty program there a reason and more thing to do but still speculation .,technology
it is trying to say maybe not too far away with a civilization which got their first before u early enough that they could send our signal but how far away would you need to go before ?,technology
we have little knowledge about that .,technology
we havent seen any signal yet but it is worth looking .,technology
it is worth looking .,technology
and what i am trying to say here another possible place where you might look .,technology
now you are not looking at civilization which got their first .,technology
you are looking at those civilization which were successful probably .,technology
a lot more success on their we are likely to be but it look and thing .,technology
but what signal would they be ?,technology
i havent been focused .,technology
what to use the most beautiful idea in physic or mathematics or the art at the intersection of the two ?,technology
i am going to have to say complex analysis .,technology
i might have said infinity and one of the most single beautiful idea i think wa the fact that you can have infinity of different size and on .,technology
but thats in a way i think complex analysis .,technology
this go it is got much magic in it .,technology
it is a very simple idea .,technology
there no real number which ha to satisfy that .,technology
you have to think of there a number called i. you think you invent it ?,technology
in a certain sense it is there already .,technology
but this number when you add that square root of minus one to it you have whats called the complex number and they are an incredible system .,technology
in a sense thats the most magical thing ive seen in mathematics or physic and it is in quantum mechanic .,technology
it is there already .,technology
you might think whats it doing there ?,technology
a nice beetle piece of mathematics and then suddenly we see nope it is the very crucial basis of quantum mechanic .,technology
on the way the world work .,technology
on the question of whether math is discovered or invented it sound you may be suggesting that partially it is possible that math is not indeed discovered .,technology
no it is more archaeology than you might think .,technology
let me ask the most ridiculous maybe the most important question .,technology
what is the meaning of life ?,technology
what give your life a filament purpose happiness and meaning ?,technology
what do you think we are here on this ?,technology
given all the big bang and the infinity is the photon that weve talked about .,technology
i would say i think it is not a stupid question .,technology
there are some people many of my colleague are scientist and they say thats a stupid question meaning it we hear because thing came together and produced life and on .,technology
i think there more to it .,technology
but what there is thats more to it .,technology
much idea .,technology
and it might be somehow connected to the mechanism of consciousness that we were talking about the mystery there .,technology
and there are mystery there which are look mathematical mystery but they seem to have a bearing on the way the physical world operates .,technology
we are scratching the surface .,technology
we are at a long huge way to go before we understand that .,technology
and it is a beautiful idea that the depth the mathematical depth could be discovered and then there tragedy of ghetto and completeness along the way that will have to somehow figure our way around .,technology
roger a a huge honor to talk to you thank you much for your time today .,technology
it is me my pleasure .,technology
thank you .,technology

if you enjoyed this podcast subscribe on youtube review it with five star on that podcast support on patreon or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman .,technology
and now let me leave you with some word of wisdom that roger penrose wrote in his book the emperor new mind .,technology
i beneath all this technicality is the feeling that it is indeed quote unquote obvious that the conscious mind can not work a computer .,technology
even though much of what is involved in mental activity might do this is the obviousness that a child can see .,technology
though the child may later in life become brow beaten into believing that the obvious problem are quote unquote nonproblems .,technology
to be argued into nonexistence by careful reasoning and clever choice of definition .,technology
child sometimes see thing clearly that are obscured in later life .,technology
we often forget the wonder that we felt a child when the care of the quote unquote real world have begun to settle on our shoulder .,technology
child are not afraid to post basic question that may embarrass u a adult to ask .,technology
what happens to each of our stream of consciousness after we die ?,technology
where wa it before we were born ?,technology
might we become or have been someone else ?,technology
why do we perceive it all ?,technology
why are we here ?,technology
why is there a universe here at all in which we can be ?,technology
these are puzzle that tend to come with the awakening of awareness in any of u . and no doubt with the awakening of selfawareness within whichever creature or other entity it first came .,technology
thank you for listening and hope to see you next time .,technology
three two one .,technology
how are you sir ?,technology
thank you .,technology
doing this man .,technology
ive been enjoying your work for many many many year .,technology
thank you .,technology
i appreciate that .,technology
and i started your new book .,technology
it is hasnt confused the shit out of me yet but i know it is coming .,technology
it will be coming .,technology
with all your work .,technology
the beginning of time the beginning of the universe to the end .,technology
thats essentially what you are summarizing .,technology
yeah thats the backdrop to the entire narrative of the book .,technology
i want the reader to get a feel for the whole thing .,technology
how it started how thing you and me rise up how consciousness emerges issue of free will and whether we have it and then on to the future whats going to happen to u and the world and the universe a time elapses to the far far future ?,technology
it is i am getting to the part where you are talking about how entropy and evolution comingle to create life .,technology
and when you think of entropy a lot of people think of something dissolving into chaos .,technology
yeah exactly .,technology
but thats not necessarily the case .,technology
it is only part of the story .,technology
it is the thing that you want to avoid but somehow the law of physic do not allow you to avoid it .,technology
it is this disintegration .,technology
it is this decay .,technology
it is this drive toward this order .,technology
and thats true .,technology
but the reality of the situation is more subtle because overall entropy need to go up .,technology
but that doesnt mean there can not be little pocket of order that form along the way .,technology
and in fact the universe is incredibly clever .,technology
star the ubiquitous feature of the heaven they are pocket of order that naturally form but a they form they increase the entropy in the surroundings .,technology
the net entropy go up even though this beautiful orderly bright object in the sky appears .,technology
and it is only because of the appearance of star that the universe is an interesting place .,technology
without star the particle of the universe would disperse the universe would get bigger and bigger colder and colder and that would be it .,technology
there wouldnt be any structure in the universe .,technology
it wasnt for the force of gravity .,technology
star themselves the fact that they exist is very strange .,technology
that you have this thing in ours is fairly small ?,technology
it is a million time larger than earth .,technology
and it is going to burn for billion of year .,technology
and it is hovering there .,technology
and it creates all the life .,technology
literary is responsible for all the life .,technology
and when they supernova that creates the actual ingredient for life which is even more strange you can not have biological carbonbased life if it is not for a star exploding .,technology
we often in a poetic way said that we are made of star stuff .,technology
thats a star .,technology
i wa saying but you can also say that we are made of nuclear refuse ?,technology
we are the detritus that the deaththrows of a star put out into the universe and it rain down on planet .,technology
and at least on one such planet that stuff come together in yield life .,technology
it is a cycle .,technology
i want to sound the lion king here but it is what it is .,technology
what i am interested in about getting into your book is the fact that you are detailing all these step that have to take place in order for all this life in order for this universe to be what it is and then where it is going to go .,technology
and the remarkable thing and the main point at some level is that look we are special entity .,technology
we can think we can reflect we have emotion .,technology
but ultimately you and i and everybody else were bag of particle that are governed by physical law .,technology
and there this continuity between the stuff of the world the inanimate stuff of the world the inanimate stuff of the heaven and u . we all come from the same fundamental ingredient and the same fundamental law .,technology
now some people find that that give them i do not know a sense of desperation a sense of or not special a sense that somehow the universe is pointless or meaningless .,technology
but my view on this is it is spectacular that we are made of the same stuff that make up this bottle of water or any of the wonderful statue you have on this desk .,technology
because that mean that how remarkable that collection of particle can do what we do .,technology
and i think thats the way of looking at the continuity .,technology
we do not need to be endowed with some special quality by some external entity .,technology
you do not need that .,technology
particle can do miraculous thing .,technology
and that is the message that i think you can draw from a more complete understanding of where we came from and where we are going .,technology
that the fear of death and the attitude of the finite life being insignificant that what is the point ?,technology
it is existential angst that many of u struggle with ?,technology
thats something that you touch upon early on .,technology
this thing that make u unique is that we know that we are going to die .,technology
that to me is the vital distinguishing feature of our specie .,technology
we can reflect on the past .,technology
we can think about the future and recognize that we are not going to be here in the future at least for some period of time .,technology
and it is an idea and it is powerful motive any influence .,technology
one that ha been explored throughout the age .,technology
otto ranc wa one of the early disciple of freud who ultimately broke with freud developed this thesis that our awareness of our own mortality is one of the driving factor in what we do .,technology
and then when i wa i do not know it wa in my 20 or 30 . i read a book by a guy named ernest becker called denialet death .,technology
i am going to be a very hurt of this book .,technology
it wa big in the 70 and one the pulitzer prize in the 70 . and it is a wonderful distillation of this way of thinking about why we human do what we do .,technology
and in many way in my own book the one thats coming out today until the end of the time it is extending this notion that becker developed in denialet death .,technology
but now seeing it in a cosmological setting .,technology
because it is not we that are going to die .,technology
it is every structure in the universe is going to disintegrate in time .,technology
our our best theory suggests to u that even proton the very heart of matter their quantum process that in the far future will ensure that every proton disintegrates fall apart into it constituent particle .,technology
and that point there no complex matter around at all .,technology
what what what what what timeline are we talking about ?,technology
in fact id to use a metaphor to try to give you a feel for the time involved .,technology
i to use the empire stapling .,technology
and imagine that every floor of the empire stapling represents a duration ten time out of the previous floor .,technology
on the ground floor it is one year first floor ten you are second floor one hundred and forth .,technology
you are going exponentially far in time a you climb up the empire stapling .,technology
and in that scheme of thing everything from the big bang until today you are about at the 10th floor ten to the ten year ten billion year .,technology
and a you go forward you are looking at thing very far in the future and to answer your question we think and i underscore think because we are now at the speckled event of our theoretical idea proton will decay roughly and say by the 38th floor .,technology
ten to the thirty eight year into the future .,technology
we can relax for a little bit .,technology
you can relax for a little bit .,technology
but here the thing the amazing thing obviously is it sound tripe a time is relative ?,technology
any duration that seems long it is only long by comparison to another duration .,technology
and on say the scale of the entire empire stapling up to say ten to the one hundred year into the future which is what the peak would represent ten to the thirty eight year is le than the blink of an eye .,technology
it is nothing on those scale .,technology
you start to have to be careful whether you are intuition .,technology
if you are willing to entertain the fantastic long timescales that you necessarily need to if you are going to think about the very far future .,technology
is there speculation a to what happens when proton do ceased to exist ?,technology
we anticipate that all complex structure will fall apart .,technology
if there are any star left over we believe that by the 14th floor most star will have used up their nuclear fuel .,technology
there will be dark ember smokey out there in the cosmos .,technology
but if they are still hovering around by the 38th floor they will all dissipate into their particulate ingredient .,technology
it is hard to imagine .,technology
pas say floor thirty eight .,technology
that there going to be any life for any mind or any complex astronomical structure out there in the universe .,technology
the window within which the universe a we know it exists is small when you think about it in term of the entire cosmic timeline .,technology
impossible to understand the actual span of it because it is long but yet small .,technology
in the human mind .,technology
it is very hard to hold these duration in mind .,technology
i do not i do not feel ive been thinking about this stuff for a long time .,technology
i do not feel i have an intuition for the duration that we are talking about .,technology
in fact the empire state building that little analogy help me to give some relative sense of when thing of interest will happen in the universe .,technology
but we are good at understanding day week month year the time of conventional experience .,technology
we have no basis for understanding the universe over these scale that weve never experienced .,technology
and thats true not only for time it is also for space ?,technology
we have very good intuition about everyday phenomenon .,technology
if i have to take this bottle of water i throw out a tube youd catch it .,technology
where to put your hand you wouldnt have to calculate it newtonian trajectory to figure out where the water is going .,technology
but if i wa to do the same thing with electron you do not have a neitherdoeye quantum intuition about the wave function and the probability that govern how a particle electron behaves .,technology
and thats simply because we were unfortunately or fortunately born a big creature relative to the scale of quantum mechanic .,technology
and because of that our intuition wa never under any evolutionary pressure to understand how electron behave .,technology
in fact i to say those of our forebear wondering around the african of anna who started to think about electron in quantum mechanic they got eaten ?,technology
they are the one who gene did not propagate onward .,technology
and therefore those of u who are the beneficiary of the survival of our ancestor were good at understanding newtonian physic but were not good at understanding anything else about the deep reality of the world .,technology
do you anticipate that someday in the future whatever is next after human being will be able to understand these concept ?,technology
because if you stop and think about what human is weve only been this for x amount of one hundredzero year .,technology
and it is a good question .,technology
and it is a tough one .,technology
i can at least imagine that a a possibility .,technology
what it would take to get there and whether our specie will ever last long enough to have that an impact on our intuition .,technology
i do not know but it is all about experience and survival .,technology
we have been programmed by evolution not to understand the true nature of the world .,technology
weve been programmed by evolution to survive .,technology
and those are two radically different proposition because you do not need to know the true nature of reality to survive .,technology
it is a distinct attribute .,technology
and one that is not necessarily one that ha any survival value to understand black hole or the big bang or general activity or quantum mechanic or entropy or thermodynamics .,technology
these quality we develop a we go forward and try to understand the world go beyond mere survival and figure out thing that excite u but it is not something which obviously ha any survival value .,technology
whats interesting is also how relatively recently people have been pondering these idea in a a quantifiable way .,technology
we can write thing down and express it with other scientist and try to figure out who and who wrong in term of these calculation .,technology
but human being when did we start pondering the scope of the universe ?,technology
pretty recently .,technology
if you think about the beginning of modern physic you can start with galileo you can start with newton but in any event we are talking on the order of hundred of year .,technology
and then a couple hundred year after that we migrate from that understanding which is an encapsulation of the pattern that we can all discern with the naked eye .,technology
and that progression only took say a couple hundred year .,technology
and thats where weve gotten .,technology
it is spectacular that we being who are coming of age here in the milky way galaxy can sit down with a piece of paper and a calculation of pencil .,technology
and we can figure out magnetic property of particle electron to ten decimal place .,technology
thats shocking .,technology
it is stunning .,technology
and it is something that i think all of u should be very proud of that our specie have been able to accomplish that .,technology
somehow i know that i do not think i am responsible .,technology
i do not feel any of my people are at home .,technology
no it is a collective effort .,technology
and thats a beauty of science .,technology
in the end of the day it is not that most scientist are ever going to be remembered .,technology
you stop someone in the street and ask them to name a scientist .,technology
yeah they may say hawking they may say einstein .,technology
thats it i think for most people .,technology
and i do not think thats a bad thing per se because it is not about the personality or the people that have pushed the frontier of understanding .,technology
it is the fact that weve got this body of insight that continues to grow and can to allow u to manipulate and understand the natural world .,technology
and i think thats what it is all about .,technology
do not you think that there are some personality yourself feynman neil degrasse tyson that because of their personality because they are their charismatic people .,technology
it make more people intrigued about these possibility and make more people attracted to the idea .,technology
we teach toward assessment .,technology
and if you want to figure out how to flatten a kid interest in these teach some stuff and tell them you are going to be tested on this on tuesday .,technology
you are going to have to spit about everything that youve learned .,technology
i find it heartbreaking the way in which much intrinsic interest in these idea you can see it a five or six year old ?,technology
i to say we begin a little scientist .,technology
we are exploring the world but trying to figure thing out .,technology
and then we go into the educational system .,technology
and it is not by malice .,technology
it is by the nature of how we teach in the current approach to educational philosophy that many kid wind up seeing these idea a a burden .,technology
something i do not want to have to spend time learning about part of the sale or how to balance reaction .,technology
i see with my own kid ive got fifteen year old son at twelve year old daughter and all they are motivated by is next wednesday quiz .,technology
and i am hey these idea are they are exciting .,technology
they are wonderful .,technology
i want to know enough i can do on the quiz .,technology
and once the quiz is over they leave the idea behind .,technology
when did these idea become a tractor to you ?,technology
i wa i do not know not unusual for a scientist but unusual i think in the spectrum of kid in the world because at five or six year old i wa captivated by mathematics. ?,technology
yeah five or six .,technology
my dad wa a composer .,technology
he wa a he wa a comedian .,technology
he wa in the early day we go around the country and with a harmonica group and a stage show that thats what he did .,technology
he liked to say that he wa an sphd a sword park high school dropout .,technology
at at tenth grade he hit the road .,technology
but he loved scientific idea .,technology
he taught me the basic of arithmetic when i wa about five year old .,technology
and then i would ask him to set me problem and hed give me these thirty digit number by thirty digit number .,technology
id write the man in big construction paper and id spend the weekend calculating away on these huge arithmetic problem of no interest to anybody on planet earth .,technology
but to me the fact that you could learn a little piece of math and then do something that nobody had ever done before that wa exciting to me a a kid and thats what got me going .,technology
you chose the path .,technology
yeah personality whatever it is that it is to do .,technology
you always wonder about that .,technology
i do not know if you wonder i wa wondering how can you not ?,technology
what what would have happened if x would have transpired instead of y ?,technology
and in fact i have to say when i graduated college i had a period of i do not know depression is too strong a word for it .,technology
but a period of what have i done ?,technology
i went to college .,technology
how did you get past that ?,technology
i wa given a second chance .,technology
i won a scholarship to go to england oxford and it ostensibly wa to study physic .,technology
but when i got there i realized that i wa completely free to do whatever i wanted to do at that point and i took a year to study literature .,technology
i went to the physic class i wa showing up but i wasnt focused on it at all and instead i wa focused i got an england it is a tutorial system .,technology
i got a tutor which is somebody at the college that set you assignment and you write paper .,technology
you go in and you read your paper out loud .,technology
it is not something we turned it in and it is graded .,technology
it is a very personal experience .,technology
you write something and you are delivering it to this individual that is going to help you in your educational journey .,technology
and thats what i did for a year .,technology
at the end of the year i had to myself ive got it .,technology
this time that you took off this year we need to take it off but you changed path .,technology
yeah how beneficial wa that for you ?,technology
do you think it helped you appreciate what your original subject of interest wa a ?,technology
yeah hugely because it is funny .,technology
it is the flip side of something i often encounter with people that are interested in science but do not know the math .,technology
and they always say or some say i am never going to understand this body of science because i do not know the mathematics .,technology
and i try to convince them look at some level thats true .,technology
if you want to do research in the general theory of relativity youve got to learn differential geometry in all the tensor calculus but if you are interested in the idea you can grasp the idea without the technical background .,technology
i try to demystify something that can seem impenetrable because you have an entered the field .,technology
and i think the same thing happened to me in reverse for the more humanistic exploration .,technology
it had this aura of of grandeur that i wa unable to penetrate because id never immersed myself in the idea .,technology
and by spending a year in those idea it did not diminish them in any way but i felt it brought it back down to earth a another journey toward truth another pathway toward insight .,technology
and one that you do not have to have a degree in .,technology
you do not have to know the in and out of the academic version of that subject to understand it and grasp it and spend some time thinking about it .,technology
you think that for people studying anything particularly those studying science and mathematics very rigid discipline do you think that they all could benefit from expanding their education into philosophy or art or something that us your mind in a different way ?,technology
but for i think for many others and certainly for me look i a most people do but not all but ive learned early on that i am not going to be an albert einstein .,technology
i can make contribution and i have had contribution to it fails string theory and cosmology but they are never going to be at the level of shattering our understanding of the world thing that people are going to talk about five hundred year from now thats unlikely .,technology
and i think for somebody that who able to make contribution but pulling away from the technical work is not going to extract some vital insight into the nature of the world that otherwise wouldnt be discovered .,technology
i think there is great value in doing exactly what you are saying because by broadening your perspective on what the work you are doing is revealing .,technology
it is part of the human quest for understanding and seeing it a an isolated discipline where it is all about the next equation and the better unified theory or the deeper understanding of the big bang to see that a isolated from the human quest for understanding .,technology
i think to menace the work that we a physicist do .,technology
wa that a part of your initial ambition ?,technology
yeah one is something that we rocked the world .,technology
yeah to go back to the comment that you made before about we being the only specie that know that we are going to die .,technology
a part of it is a symbolic immortality .,technology
you create something that will last .,technology
you create something that will have such impact that it will stick around for a long long period of time .,technology
i think yes part of my motivation in doing physic wa not merely to get the next decimal place in this or that physical quantity described in the natural world .,technology
it wa to try to have some insight that would rock our understanding of the world and have reverberation that would echo out for many many year to come .,technology
thats interesting .,technology
did that torture you somewhat ?,technology
doe that something that would haunted you in your head all the time ?,technology
not but an ultimate ambition .,technology
but ultimate ambition yeah for sure .,technology
and look i think when when you are doing any work whatsoever the daytoday the moment to moment is a grind .,technology
i do not know how you find it in the work that you are doing but if i am working on a research project even if in principle the idea are grand and wonderful embold the moment to moment is calculating away .,technology
it is trying to figure out that equation .,technology
it is putting an equation on a computer .,technology
it is not sexy .,technology
it is not something that ha that glorious quality that you might ultimately describe when you are finished and you look back and you think about the implication of your work .,technology
the moment to moment of almost anything that you do is i think thats ultimately what is the driver of whatever you are doing in your life the moment to moment .,technology
but yeah there wa certainly a part of me that would have a desire a hope that the work would reverberate in a powerful way .,technology
i think thats true for most physicist that notion that you can sit at a table and think and change the way we understand reality the way einstein did the way schrödinger did the way neils board .,technology
but what percentage of people have that revelation ?,technology
yeah i think it is pretty few and far between .,technology
and what else is contributing ?,technology
and then occasionally someone exactly some light bulb go off powerful new insight and you are everything ha suddenly changed .,technology
thats exciting though .,technology
and it is what keep you going .,technology
to be the person who ha the light bulb .,technology
yeah but i tell my student and especially young student who come in there are still trying to figure out what they want to do if you are not satisfied with contributing .,technology
if you are not satisfied with being part of the journey but not the person at the head of the breakthrough it is probably not the field for you because it is unlikely because it is not brainpower .,technology
it is thinking of the question it is thinking of thing in the orientation .,technology
it is being at the place at the time with the dna that somehow is a tune to the question thats being asked .,technology
it is not even fully under your control .,technology
it is not a matter of exercising your mind and building up the muscle of the brain in such a way that you are the strongest person to contribute to this in this idea .,technology
it is luck it is timing .,technology
it is being there when the question being asked and you happen to see the way forward .,technology
thats it is interesting to me that there many people working on all this stuff and that the average person that doesnt contemplate quantum physic or any of these equation we have no idea it is going on .,technology
and that this all this work thats critical to our understanding of what the universe is with the very fiber of the universe itself .,technology
all this is going on and most people are they are reaping the residual benefit of it .,technology
but they are wandering around and not knowing .,technology
in fact there a number thats quoted that quantum mechanic is responsible for something thirty five of the gross national product .,technology
it is it is in a very concrete way .,technology
now the problem with that number is i recently looked it up to find the source of it .,technology
i went online and checked it out .,technology
and apparently i am the source of this number .,technology
and i assure you that ive not done a calculation that fully justifies this .,technology
but roughly speaking anything that ha an integrated circuit is the result of beneficiary of quantum insight .,technology
we use this stuff every moment of our technological life .,technology
and yet a you say for the most part most of u do not have a deep understanding of the reality thats responsible for the gadgetry that the science ha given rise to .,technology
and it is a strange quantum mechanic is an utterly strange reality .,technology
two strange .,technology
ive tried many many time tried to understand whether it is sean carroll book or yours or any one .,technology
and again it go back to our brain werent under pressure to think quantum mechanically .,technology
but i assure you you give me a couple of hour .,technology
book are one thing because it is a one sided conversation .,technology
but you give me a couple of hour in a back and forth .,technology
and i will absolutely get you to a place where you appreciate and have a sense of what these idea are telling u about the nature of the world .,technology
here the thing that ive always wanted to ask someone you .,technology
what do you think wa happening before the big bang ?,technology
it is a it is a deep question and a subtle one .,technology
and there two way that id to think about that question .,technology
one a it could be that the big bang wa an interesting event but not the first event in the totality of reality .,technology
it could have been the first event that sparked the expansion of our part of space .,technology
but it could be that there a grander realm of space within which we set a a small part and that grander realm may have been there for a far longer period of time .,technology
it may have experienced it own big bang maybe a collection of big bang that may extend infinitely far into the past .,technology
it could be that the answer to the question of what happened before the big bang is a lot of other big bang or a lot of other quantum event that were taking place in a larger landscape of reality than we have direct access to .,technology
however another answer is that the very question may not make a much sense a the word seem to suggest .,technology
we know how to parse that sense .,technology
we know what it mean to talk about the moment before the big bang because we know how to talk about the moment before your birth or the moment before the civil war or the moment before any event that happened the world .,technology
we fully understand the meaning of that sentence .,technology
but it could be that when it come to the big bang the sentence doesnt mean anything .,technology
it could be that the big bang wa the place where time itself started and hawking himself had a wonderful analogy to get this across .,technology
ill dress it up a little bit .,technology
imagine you are walking on planet earth and you pas by something and you say hey can you point me in the direction of north ?,technology
i want to walk in the north with direction .,technology
they point you continue to walk you pas by somebody else .,technology
say hey which way is further north and they point you in that direction ?,technology
but when you get to the north pole and talk to somebody there and say hey how do i go further north ?,technology
they look at you and say whoa that question doesnt mean anything because this is where north begin .,technology
there no notion of going further north than the north pole and it could be that that spatial metaphor applies to time .,technology
talk about a billion year ago or a ten billion year ago but if you go to a thirteen.eight billion year ago the big bang that may be where time started and you can not go further back in time than the very origin of time itself .,technology
that freak me out .,technology
see that ?,technology
thats one that get in your head and you would mean beginning of time .,technology
why would time have a beginning ?,technology
and it could be it could be the time is an emergent quality of reality .,technology
i give you an analogy boy what by that is we all know what temperature mean intuitively .,technology
somethings hot you feel it is somethings cold you feel it your body understands those concept .,technology
what physic ha done is it is gone deeper into the concept of temperature and revealed that it is nothing but the average motion of the particle making up the environment .,technology
if the molecule are moving quickly youve got a hot environment .,technology
if the molecule are moving slowly it is a cold environment .,technology
temperature emerges from the motion of particle .,technology
if you have one particle you can not talk about it being hot or cold because you need a conglomerate you need a glomerate of particle to be able to talk about their average motion .,technology
and in that sense temperature is this emergent idea that rest upon more fundamental idea the molecule and atom that make up reality .,technology
maybe thats true of time .,technology
maybe time a we know it is a property that only make sense in certain environment when there enough stuff arranged in the pattern .,technology
but fundamentally maybe there are atom or molecule of time which when not arranged in the form that we are familiar with do not yield time a we know it .,technology
time itself may be a quality of the world that exists here in this environment but doesnt even apply in other environment that are configured radically differently .,technology
thats a heavy one .,technology
yeah thats a heavy one .,technology
we would also say heavy one is what caused the big bang .,technology
yeah why would something smaller than the head of a pin ?,technology
become everything that we see in the cosmos .,technology
there are idea for the answer to that question .,technology
look all of this is tentative because it is very hard to do measurement that go all the way back to the beginning .,technology
we have astronomical observation that we need to be sure are compatible with the prediction of our theory in forth .,technology
we is good scientist do what need to be done to try to test these idea .,technology
but the idea that i think most physicist are cosmologist by into at the moment is that gravity can have two manifestation .,technology
the usual form of gravity that you and i know about is the attractive version .,technology
you drop something toward the earth and it move downward because the earth and the object pull on each other .,technology
thats the ordinary gravity that we experience every day of our life .,technology
but einstein equation allow gravity to also be repulsive .,technology
it can push outward a opposed to pulling inward .,technology
and this is something that we have never experienced because the gravity created by a rocky object the earth is always the attractive variety .,technology
the gravity created by the sun again compact object is always the attractive variety .,technology
but einstein math show that if you do not have a rocky object thats isolated in space but rather energy that is uniformly spread through a region of space that that entity yield repulsive gravity .,technology
why is that important to your question ?,technology
if the very early universe that little tiny head of a pin that you are talking about if it wa filled with a uniform bath of this energy we call it the infloton field .,technology
the name doesnt matter .,technology
but if it wa filled with that energy it would have been subject to repulsive gravity .,technology
what doe repulsive gravity do ?,technology
push everything apart cause everything to rush outward .,technology
the bang of the big bang may have been a spark of repulsive gravity operating with a tiny region of space that pushed everything apart .,technology
and this concept of repulsive gravity is theoretical .,technology
we observed any element in the universe that it is theoretical .,technology
but it is at a level of understanding that i think most physicist would say cause it to migrate into the camp of established understanding of how gravity work .,technology
number one einstein equation have now been tested over and over again in a whole variety of circumstance .,technology
the detection of gravitational wave a couple of year ago is the crowning triumph of einstein math .,technology
the hundred year ago the math say there should be ripple in the fabric of space a hundred year later .,technology
we finally detect ripple in the fabric of space .,technology
we are very comfortable with any prediction that come out of einstein mathematics .,technology
and in the mathematics is the prediction of what i wa described .,technology
youve got uniform energy and a region repulsive gravity .,technology
the other thing is we currently witness that the expansion of the universe is speeding up not slowing down .,technology
since the 1920s everybody thought that yes the universe is expanding but it will slow down over time .,technology
because gravity pull thing back together .,technology
you throw an apple upward .,technology
it doesnt go up faster and faster .,technology
it go up slower and slower because the earth gravity pull it back .,technology
everybody thought that would apply to the universe a a whole .,technology
it is expanding but expanding ever slower .,technology
the observation in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight culminated in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight which won the two thousand and eleven nobel prize showed that the distant galaxy are moving way ever more quickly .,technology
the expansion of space is speeding up over time .,technology
it is accelerating .,technology
how do we explain that ?,technology
the best explanation we currently have is repulsive gravity .,technology
we believe even today the universe is suffused with the bath of energy .,technology
we call it dark energy .,technology
we believe it is uniformly going through space .,technology
i to think of it almost a a a turkish sauna .,technology
it is the steam filling the sauna this energy filling space .,technology
and that repulsive gravity we believe is responsible for the observation that the distant galaxy are rushing way faster and faster over time .,technology
it is circumstantial but the case for repulsive gravity is quite strong .,technology
and what would have caused it to coal ?,technology
what would have caused it to compress initially ?,technology
why would all that matter be in this tiny le than the pin sized object ?,technology
nobody else on planet earth ha any real idea .,technology
but we do have theory .,technology
one of the theory suggests that in the very early universe it wa a highly chaotic environment .,technology
very hot with all the field fluctuating wildly up and down .,technology
and the idea would be that if you wait long enough we are it is hard to know what wait mean in this environment but do not press me on my definition of time back then .,technology
if you wait long enough on rare occasion the energy will happen to flatten out in a region become uniform and then that region explosively inflates .,technology
imagine you are looking at a pot of boiling water .,technology
the surface is of course widely undulating up and down .,technology
but if you wait long enough very long time since youve never seen it neither of i there will be a little patch on the surface of that boiling water that flattens out .,technology
that only mean that the water molecule happen for an instant to be moving in the way to keep that little patch of water from wildly bubbling .,technology
it will happen it is a rare but if you wait long enough it will occur .,technology
similarly the widely undulating field in the early universe if you wait long enough a patch will flatten out .,technology
you get the uniform energy plug it in time time equation that region explosively inflates .,technology
and explosively it can go from size thats much le than an atomic diameter to larger than the observable universe in far le than a blink of an eye .,technology
in ten to the minus thirty ten to the minus thirty five second .,technology
thats how powerful rebel of gravity can be .,technology
that is baffling .,technology
before that before this happens you have in this theory you have all of this energy randomly interacting with other energy in the universe with no physical object .,technology
it is could have been forever .,technology
that could in fact thats the main point .,technology
there nobody who is hanging around looking at their watching .,technology
good god when is this big bang going to finally happen ?,technology
you can have this cosmological preshow .,technology
you can have it last a long a you .,technology
the only thing that you need to happen is that sooner or later a region flat end out and then the cosmological show begin .,technology
and if we are looking at this model of the universe being this infinite universe yeah with different characteristic and different quality to them this could be happening throughout infinity .,technology
yeah all over the place .,technology
and in fact this called inflation cosmology is the technical name for the subject say that it say that it is quite likely that this explosive inflation of the region that we currently inhabit it wa one of many such event .,technology
and therefore there are other farflung region throughout this larger cosmological landscape where thing have also inflated but the detail can be different .,technology
the physical detail can differ from what we are familiar with .,technology
and the difference can be small temperature difference in one part of space versus another or they can be far more significant even the particle that make up that other realm may be different from the particle that make up our realm .,technology
their mass can be different .,technology
their charge can be different .,technology
their fundamental physical feature can be different .,technology
out there in that wider cosmological landscape it can be the wild wild west of reality .,technology
and they do not have to worry about proton deterioration .,technology
there may be realm in which they do not have to worry about proton falling apart .,technology
you come to these crazy sounding scifi sounding idea that you and i are having this conversation out there in other distant realm .,technology
and this is not an overworked theorist imagination .,technology
this is the careful dispassionate analysis of the mathematical equation .,technology
now i should say there are some physicist who see this implication and say whoa you guy have fallen off the deep end .,technology
your theory ha imploded because any theory that predicts that a wealth of reality that are untestable because they are far away that we will never interact with them .,technology
thats a theory that we have been trained to avoid to exercise .,technology
however the more forward thinking i to describe u physicist say hey math ha proven to be a very valuable guide over the course of hundred of year .,technology
and if this is where the math is taking u it is at least worthy of our attention to investigate it fully and possibly come to the conclusion that this is how reality behaves .,technology
thats the weirdest one .,technology
the weirdest one .,technology
it is when people talk about intelligent life someone in the universe that you are out there or the version of you or infinite version of you .,technology
yeah and it can be disturbing .,technology
what do you mean by you ?,technology
if there are many of yous out there each of whom ha an equal claim on being you because theyve had the same experience .,technology
they have the same memory .,technology
and maybe have made infinite variation in the decision that youve made through your life .,technology
you could meet a brian green your age somewhere out there in the universe thats made a choice .,technology
or the wrong one .,technology
become a gambling addict .,technology
yeah it is they start to accept u . weve got weve got spock and evil spock .,technology
the one that had the little beard on. . this is going to be a little beard and version of me .,technology
it go out there .,technology
yeah and the thing i want to stress is this sound cookie .,technology
and the danger of cookie sounding idea and physic is that there are people who then jump off for it and say if thats possible then then this is possible .,technology
maybe i can with my mind effect what other people are .,technology
there all sort of crazy idea that can be inspired by the weird insight of modern physic .,technology
and youve got to keep straight whats real and whats ridiculous .,technology
yeah thats a problem. . when people start using especially if there are articulate let start using scientific lingo to describe thing that are very unscientific .,technology
what the bleep .,technology
what the bleep .,technology
but that wa one of those movie where a lot of people there wa all this quantum talk and yeah .,technology
dr. quantum wa in it .,technology
the whole cartoon is particle and wave .,technology
and they are they are science behind this .,technology
but then at the end of it it wa something that wa created by someone who run a cult who belief they are channeling someone who a thousand year old alien that whole ramp thing .,technology
a couple year ago i wa in middle of a big project .,technology
in fact i described this in the end of the book .,technology
youll get to this little anecdote if you choose to carry on reading .,technology
i wa in the middle of a big project and speaking opportunity came in and i did not properly vet it .,technology
the money looked good and looked a fine thing and i signed off on it .,technology
and then a few day before i am going i realized it is to go to talk to judy zebra knight who channel romptha the thirty fivezero year old memorian sage .,technology
and i said to the folk who should have been checking in on this the lecture agent i can not go .,technology
and they are hey brian it is tomorrow .,technology
it is too late to back out .,technology
i look at some video online and i see her on the murr griffin show where she channel romptha on live television .,technology
i do not know what year this wa .,technology
she snap her head forward and go back .,technology
she change her voice .,technology
it becomes something between the queen and yoda .,technology
there a weird place that shes old .,technology
hello being and shes talking to murr griffin .,technology
he talking about an airplane .,technology
she go what doe airplane ?,technology
it is that thing .,technology
anyway i go and i show up .,technology
and the first thing i see is they are all these people walking around a grassy field but they are arm out this .,technology
and i am can they see you are a and i get closer .,technology
they are all blindfolded .,technology
and i am saying that what what is going on here and they describe that each person ha a card around their neck where theyve written down their life dream .,technology
and an exact copy of that card ha been put out on this big field .,technology
and they have to feel their way toward the matching card .,technology
and if they succeed this show that this goal or desire is going to come to pas .,technology
and i am saying to those guy hows it going ?,technology
one person found their card .,technology
in the last few month the odds of probability of that happening are not unreasonable but thats all that this is .,technology
and then they take me to the blindfolded archer .,technology
they are taking bow and arrow and they are firing at these target .,technology
and man i am standing way back on this thing .,technology
and they ask me do you want to try it ?,technology
and i wa there a photographer thats come along .,technology
i am no ill avoid that .,technology
and then they introduce me to this woman who is able to predict the next card in a in a shuffle deck .,technology
and she would pull out this card and shed say it is going to be seven of club .,technology
and it is a three of spade .,technology
and then the next one is a seven of diamond .,technology
and you go there the seven that i wa talking about one card before .,technology
this is crazy circumstance where and then i go i go to give my talk .,technology
because thats why i wa there after all .,technology
this wa the preamble they were showing me what they do .,technology
i walk into this barn .,technology
and i across the threshold of barn and they all give me a standing ovation .,technology
and i am thats appreciated .,technology
but why are you giving me a standing ovation ?,technology
and i go in and i start to give my talk .,technology
and i and i say to them straight out what ive seen here is nut .,technology
i say if you are going to try to predict next card in a deck one hour or four time well get the suit .,technology
one hour thirteen time we get the rank .,technology
there nothing in there but the pure probabilistic law of mathematics they rise up and give me a standing ovation .,technology
and i say it is appreciated .,technology
but why are you applauding ?,technology
i am telling you that you are wasting your time .,technology
and they applaud me again .,technology
and i am this is weird .,technology
but then i go to the book signing i finish my talk and the book signing these people they come up with me and they they talk real soft and say there a lot of crazy stuff thats happening in this place .,technology
but we come here because we feel that there something else in the world and we want to be around minded individual that are searching for the deeper truth .,technology
thank you for calling out the silliness thats happening here .,technology
but well come here anyway and spend our money because we want to be part of the journey .,technology
and i have to tell you i had a degree of sympathy for them because i get the motivation .,technology
a a physicist what we do is we are revealing strange feature of the world .,technology
i get the urge i get the desire that the problem is that the methodology thats being employed is something that will never take you closer to the truth .,technology
however much you may feel that you are among minded individual .,technology
i get the motivation .,technology
i get this sensation i get the urge but it is tragic that these individual feel that this an undertaking is a pathway that will take them toward the deeper truth .,technology
and let me finish up .,technology
after this they take me to the dinner .,technology
and the dinner and imagine at the top of the hill and thats where judy i am probably going to get suit for this conversation but ?,technology
but ive never talked about it .,technology
yeah they are quite litigious .,technology
are they ?,technology
no they are definitely are .,technology
anyway there a one person opinion .,technology
they take me to the mansion at the top of the hill .,technology
and thats where she is .,technology
she doesnt come down and participate in the talk .,technology
shes watching it on close circuit television up in the mansion .,technology
and i walk in and she hug me .,technology
but it wa too goddamn long of a hug .,technology
i am saying it wa and she wa thank you .,technology
it wa this big emotional thing .,technology
is this all still going on ?,technology
it wa a couple of year ago .,technology
i imagine if shes channeling it .,technology
we are missing thats .,technology
that would certainly rewrite every rule of reality every law of physic that i understand .,technology
would that be le weird than the big bang itself ?,technology
it is a pcc .,technology
when it come to the big bang i can sit down with the mathematics that i understand .,technology
and i can follow the deductive chain of reasoning that get u to some of these strange implication that we are talking about multiple big banges or the reality and forth .,technology
when it come to channeling a thirty fivezero year old sage i do not know what the hell that even mean .,technology
i do not understand the physical process by which that could possibly happen .,technology
i do not understand how there could have been a being of the sort that shes channeling alive thirty fivezero year ago because it doesnt have any agreement with the archaeological record .,technology
it is what they do is they they curate idea and then they run them through their filter of woo woo .,technology
and then they distributed in a very palatable way that attracts people .,technology
that movie .,technology
i tell a story ive told this before .,technology
i apologize to people who heard it .,technology
there wa a friend of mine at the comedy store had a friend that i do not know her name but she came to the comedy store and she wa happy and i am shes i am happy .,technology
she go because i found the secret .,technology
and now that i know about the secret i am going to be married i am going to be this .,technology
i am going to have this fulfilled life .,technology
i am going to reach my dream and i am excited about that .,technology
and at the time i had seen the movie and then i wa starting to understand the criticism of the movie .,technology
i wa reading all these the account here .,technology
we are scientist .,technology
we are breaking down all the thing that were wrong .,technology
and i did not dash your dream .,technology
i wa wow. . and then i saw a year later .,technology
the outside of another one of my show a different comedy club .,technology
it is thing are not going the way i thought .,technology
i thought because of the secret that everything would be grave in my dad is still a pain in the as .,technology
and when that he moved in with me he doesnt have any money .,technology
and i can not establish a good relationship .,technology
but i do not have the job that i wanted .,technology
i do not understand because ive been using the secret .,technology
i think about it every day .,technology
and i said here my take on this .,technology
if you talk to someone who very successful and you say to them hey how did you get very successful ?,technology
and they say i thought about it all the time .,technology
i have a vision board .,technology
i took that photo of the house that i wanted .,technology
i put it in the vision board .,technology
that became my house .,technology
i took this idea .,technology
i want a beautiful wife .,technology
i want a family .,technology
i want sport car .,technology
and this and that .,technology
and now i have those thing because the mind is a powerful tool .,technology
and the mind can create reality .,technology
but you are talking to someone who is successful .,technology
how many people thought that and nothing happened ? .,technology
i bet there many you have a you have a bias in successful user .,technology
those are the one that you are talking to .,technology
and because of the fact that theyve been able to have these extraordinarily successful life while visualizing these thing doe not mean that visualizing these thing creates an extraordinarily successful life .,technology
you have to think and you have to act and you have to do. . and there trial and error and there a lot of lesson to be learned .,technology
but if you wanted to simplify it at the end once you are successful and boil it down to a philosophy that you could sell a course on .,technology
thats what it would be .,technology
thats exactly .,technology
look there nothing wrong with visualizing success .,technology
but that is not the causal ingredient that will yield the success .,technology
the thing that come to mind is i do not know if they do it any longer .,technology
but there wa certainly a time when olympic athlete would be taught to visualize say jump and over that high bos and theyd run through the whole thing .,technology
but thats not all that they were doing .,technology
they were doing ten hour a day of training that integrated this visualization a part of the training program .,technology
it is tragic when people buy into these these crazy idea .,technology
and i have to tell you when they were making that film they called me to be in it .,technology
and i think it wa the director one of the producer i wa on the phone with and they were describing what they were doing .,technology
and i probed sufficiently hard .,technology
and some of my friend did not probe sufficiently hard .,technology
and we are in the film and we read it .,technology
but i probed sufficiently hard .,technology
and i said look what you are doing to me sound dangerous .,technology
it sound a bad thing to be doing .,technology
and they took offense in that call back then .,technology
a year after the film came out it wa either the director produced i can not remember the gentleman name called me up .,technology
and he said i want to apologize to you .,technology
you were absolutely .,technology
i have finally realized what a bad film this wa to be involved in .,technology
and i completely regret it .,technology
that i do not think is the point of view of the the romped the school of enlightenment which is behind this or at least part of what wa behind this .,technology
but at least the director or the producer whoever it wa saw the light and realized that this is not the information that you want to put out in the world because it can change people life in a very negative way .,technology
i think you are a comparison to olympic athlete is very good because the olympic athlete are visualizing something that they already do .,technology
what there a great benefit and visualizing for athletics for martial art for a lot of different thing .,technology
visualizing success visualizing potential problem failure of your process how you are going to adjust on the fly all those thing are great because then when thing do take place in real life situation youve already prepared for them .,technology
the path .,technology
thats what thats all about .,technology
i agree that .,technology
and in fact i have to tell in one of the chapter later chapter of the book i describe theory about why it is that we for instance tell fictional story .,technology
could there be any evolutionary value in two individual telling each other a story that they both know a false that they know ha no connection to the world around them but yet weve been doing that since the emerges of language .,technology
and there are these interesting evolutionary scenario in which what you are saying is brought to bear in that unfamiliar context .,technology
we tell story because it is the mind way of rehearsing for the real world but it is a way of rehearsing for the real world .,technology
thats completely safe .,technology
you can go on all sort of crazy journey to the underworld up into the cloud .,technology
you can engage in all sort of battle .,technology
all these thing can take place within your imagination .,technology
there value in visualizing .,technology
there value in telling story but it is not the causal part that some individual would want u to believe it is .,technology
yeah the only thing that i would say contrary to that is some people develop expectation based on fictional account .,technology
yeah and there a real problem romantic movie where some people will expect behavior that exists in these romantic movie only. . and it is not indicative of human being in the real world .,technology
it is strange to me that we desire those .,technology
someone who posse power beyond anything known to human being or any life form .,technology
yeah i get that .,technology
i love to snap your finger and fix everything .,technology
and therefore there something deeply seductive about the possibility of a being that can transcend the limitation that we mere mortal are always subject to .,technology
i think it is built into our dna to respond to the way that we do and the amount of that we do when encountering a hero in the world .,technology
there joseph campbell .,technology
the power of myth but is more technical version to hear with a thousand face .,technology
he go through the whole notion of what it is to have a myth and it is basking an individual .,technology
it is call to action to rise above the kind of activity that mere mortal will be able to undertake .,technology
resist the call at first but then rise to the challenge go out into the world conqueror come back a changed individual and shake up the reality from which that individual initially emerged on this journey .,technology
it is it is fascinating when you think of how many different language and how many different culture share those same archetypal theme .,technology
and i do think it all come if you look way back into the history of the idea it come from this initial recognition that we are mortal .,technology
and the fact that our brain are able to not fix on the moment but can think about the entire timeline is the one that make that a poignant realization .,technology
and if we couldnt think about the future who would it matter if we knew that we were going to die ?,technology
the fact that we can undertake all of these expression of creative will and the desire to transcend the world around u ha a downside .,technology
and the downside is we recognize that we are not going to be here for very long .,technology
and i think that motivates a certain engagement with the world and hero worship is part of it .,technology
because while is a fascinating care yeah he think he going to be around forever .,technology
have you discussed any of this stuff with him ?,technology
i do not know him personally .,technology
i have certainly gone to some of his talk .,technology
and i think he and i had one exchange at some point in the past .,technology
and i get where he coming from .,technology
he feel that we are perhaps the final mortal generation .,technology
and how sad it is .,technology
after a hundred thousand generation of human if we could only stick around for one more generation science would come to a point where we would be immortal .,technology
and that feel a tragic state of affair .,technology
i do not think he .,technology
and i think most people who think about this deeply do not think he either .,technology
however many vitamin you take and however much science is progressing the notion that we are a generation or two from immortality i think is wishful thinking .,technology
the strange concept of immortality too because it is not necessarily you .,technology
it is a downloaded version of you that will exist in some computer which is what doe that mean ?,technology
that sound hell .,technology
it could be .,technology
how rem sleep in that computer ?,technology
i allow for the possibility that maybe it would be a way of being in the world that would have upside that are hard for u a flesh and blood individual .,technology
to appreciate this point .,technology
would that be a good thing ?,technology
i might have said yes before ive had some pretty profound psychedelic experience .,technology
and then from then i said i am gon na hedge my bet .,technology
let me see whats next. . let me see what happens when the light go out. ?,technology
you think there may be something that happens when the light go out ?,technology
i do not know what for sure your body is going to decay and you are going to become a part of the earth .,technology
you are becoming part unless they cremate you or unless they embalm you with some toxic chemical and then nothing can use your dead tissue which is a shame .,technology
it is a shame that we do that ?,technology
unless some of the murder you and you have to exume you in the past to solve in the future whether or not solve a murder but i do not know what what do you think consciousness is ?,technology
i think consciousness is clearly a factor of brain tissue and an energy or do you think it is possible that what our brain is is something that tune into consciousness .,technology
i spend i spend some time thinking about this question .,technology
i think it is perhaps the deepest question that face sign or even humanity at some level .,technology
and my own personal perspective is that consciousness is nothing more than the choreographed motion of particle in various quantum state inside a gloppy gray structure that sits inside this thing that we call ahead .,technology
do i have any proof for that ?,technology
doe anybody have any proof for what consciousness is not at all at this moment ?,technology
now having said that there a deep puzzle .,technology
it is called the hard problem of consciousness which is if electron and cork and particle and law of physic are all that there is .,technology
and if you buy into the fact that electron do not have an inner world that cork do not have an inner world how can it be that by taking a collection of those particle you can turn on the light ?,technology
how can a collection of mindless thoughtless particle somehow yield mindful experience ?,technology
and thats a deep question that science ha not yet answered .,technology
my own feeling is when we understand the brain better that question will evaporate .,technology
and that to me is the likely answer that we will find .,technology
but there are some very smart respected people who go in a very different direction .,technology
there are some who say electron and proton and cork they do have a fundamental protoconscious quality .,technology
they themselves are conscious being of a sort .,technology
i do not buy into that but there are people who do pick a position .,technology
i take a position on this because i guess my view is you look out at the world .,technology
and what you do a a physicist is you move the smallest degree required to explain the phenomenon that you are observing .,technology
and to move from our current understanding of the world to leapfrog to a place where electron are conscious and cork are conscious to me is such a fantastically radical move that i do not consider it justified to make that move with our current level of understanding .,technology
there wa a time back in the 1800s when life itself wa mystical that people said the same thing .,technology
how could a collection of lifeless particle ever come together and yield a living being ?,technology
they said that they can not .,technology
you have to induce a life force you have to inject vitality you have to inject a life force and thats what spark the emergence of life on lifeless particle .,technology
i do not think any serious scientist think that today .,technology
no life force is necessary .,technology
that way of thinking about the world ha gone away .,technology
my own feeling is that that progression is going to happen for consciousness .,technology
today it is utterly mysterious .,technology
how it is that i have this inner voice talking inside my head ?,technology
how it is that i look around the world and i can see the color red and i can experience the color red .,technology
i do not have sensor that can call that red .,technology
an iphone can do that .,technology
i have an inner world where i feel that color red .,technology
where doe that come from ?,technology
whats interesting too to me is that a a human being my thought on consciousness are very deep and profound and this idea what is this thing ?,technology
but if i break it down objectively an animal have some a consciousness including they have instinct ?,technology
they are trying to get away from danger .,technology
if you go to single cell organism work your way up to early hominid and then get to human being you see this ever increasing form of complexity in every way .,technology
and in the way that the thing see the world of course it make sense that there would be more complexity ?,technology
but we do not think about that when we think of a parakeet .,technology
the way we look at single cell organism or champ or whatever .,technology
yeah i can imagine that .,technology
because we see small change in dna a tiny fraction of a percent yield a radical change in what the being that ha that dna is able to accomplish .,technology
but at the same time you made reference to psychedelic experience .,technology
and i trust you agree but tell me if you do not that those psychedelic experience were generated by a slight change in the chemical makeup of the particle coursing through your brain and your body .,technology
sometimes not even a change .,technology
have you done anything ?,technology
have you done anything psychedelic experience ?,technology
are you allowed to talk about ?,technology
not many and i am a complete lightweight in this arena because i hardly drink i hardly do anything that it put foreign substance into the body .,technology
the first night we went out and we went to one of these coffee bar and i guess it can be about this .,technology
i am ... it is legal here .,technology
yeah legal exactly .,technology
we took the easy way in the the the novice version and it did nothing to me at all that first night .,technology
the next night when we went i went to the bottom of the list where they it wa something that wa in dutch or something but it had machine gun pointed at a brain thing .,technology
yeah i did that version and it wa the most terrifying experience of my fucking life .,technology
is this something you smoke do a smoke ?,technology
definitely smoke .,technology
and again i suspect that the impact wa because my body ha no experience .,technology
and i think that enhanced the the impact and it wa terrifying .,technology
it wa utterly i wa in the hotel room and i wa clinging to the bed and and i said to my wife time me up not and not and any not it sound wrong .,technology
it wa something that they were completely used to .,technology
they they sent up a doctor and the doctor give you sugar and my wife knew that this wa an extreme circumstance from because i do not eat any sugar but i wa he said he doe my i wa taking a milky way bar sugar .,technology
i am sorry i do not know .,technology
i do not know the chemistry behind this but but sugar is the the antidote .,technology
caffeine is supposed to help me .,technology
caffeine helped too .,technology
yeah i guess but it lasted eight hour .,technology
even flying home on the plane the next day .,technology
all i did is i sat on my seat and i put on the headphone and there wa a beatles channel and i listened to beatles for for seven hour and i wa in this in this in this place that i had never experienced before .,technology
now now for our conversation this made it intuitively obvious to me that my conscious awareness is dependent on a few chemicals. . thats all the tapping inside of the head .,technology
in a way it wa a valuable experience .,technology
it is not something that i want to ever experience again .,technology
absolutely but it wa something that helped align my intuitive understanding of what consciousness is with the scientific recognition that it all relies upon the stuff thats circulating inside of your mind .,technology
yeah whats interesting about this this these heavy duty psychedelic experience because what you took wa by most people idea of very mild .,technology
yeah but no profound psychedelic chemical that are also produced by your brain .,technology
if you shift that ratio and not by too much you are not talking about even you are talking about little small dos of this stuff .,technology
shift that ratio it produce these profound vision .,technology
yeah ayahuasca is an early active version of dimethylchip .,technology
. . they figured out how to your brain your gut rather produce monoemine oxidase and it break down dimethylchip to mean .,technology
and they figured out how to combine an mao inhibitor with the leaf of another plant that ha the dimethylchip to mean .,technology
and i say but you could take it there synthetic version of it .,technology
but the prop point is this is something that your brain produce your liver produce .,technology
we know it is produced in the lung .,technology
it is the body make it .,technology
but it is got it is in there but that can get a down .,technology
shift the balance and also you have these incredibly profound vision .,technology
it make you think what what we have now in term of our balance and our chemical must be different than what this fellow must have had .,technology
yes chimpanzee thing. . and primate before that a the human when you think of human evolution do you ever stop to think what are we going to be a million year now if we do survive ?,technology
what have you ever done this thought experiment we say ?,technology
if thing keep going the same way we used to be very strong and very hairy and we are getting progressively softer a we do not need to use our body a much .,technology
do you do that thought experiment to see what we are going to be common ?,technology
not in a systematic scientific way because the process is fraught with incredible detail that i think it is hard for anybody even expert in evolution ideology to tell u anything that will hold water .,technology
thats predictive .,technology
but on a general level yeah because people often wonder why is it that we havent been visited by alien ?,technology
this is the thing that come up whenever you are talking about other life inside the universe .,technology
yeah yeah but but the answer to that could be quite straightforward .,technology
nobody out there care about u because we are ill developed .,technology
we are young on the cosmic scene that there nothing interesting for them to find here on planet earth .,technology
to me there a natural explanation for why there can be stuff out of their life out there and yet they do not hang out around planet earth .,technology
we do not hang around on an handheld to try to have a conversation with whats going on inside that particular structure .,technology
i buy that argument the least .,technology
you do agree that .,technology
because we are interested in butterfly .,technology
butterfly are boring .,technology
we are interested in but interested in in the mole .,technology
we are interested in them for very specific reason .,technology
typically we are interested either because we want to see the evolutionary development that yield this particular life form or because there a general curiosity about how this object is put together .,technology
if these other being are far beyond u at those kind of tax and an taxonomy question are no longer of any interest then hanging around here may not hold anything for them to make the journey and stick around long enough for u to notice .,technology
i do not buy that again for two reasons. . because why would we assume that they are far beyond u that they wouldnt be interested in these talking monkey with thermonuclear weapon who dominate an entire planet .,technology
that would be fascinating now .,technology
some planet somewhere where people or the politician all lie to themselves .,technology
everyone get video through the sky .,technology
they fly in metal tube that hurl over the over the oceans. . they pollute the ocean and eat all the fish these people are fucking crazy .,technology
weve got to go there and check this out .,technology
but but imagine that this civilization the notion of lording over a planet is u talking about the ant lording over a grain of sand .,technology
they may be galactic a opposed to planetary in their hegemony .,technology
and the notion of some little tiny rock orbiting some nondescript star in the suburb of this completely ordinary galaxy off there on the side may not have the poll that you imagine that disagree .,technology
we think it is interesting when we see a champion erocto open up a nut .,technology
we think it is interesting that there an amazing photograph of an orangutan thats spearfishing of your scene at .,technology
i have seen that .,technology
he learned it from people apparently but still interesting nonetheless. . but i do not think a hundred year from now we are going to be a interested in these quality or a thousand year for now or ten thousand year from now .,technology
why we assume that these thing that come here from another planet are more than ten thousand year .,technology
thats a good thats a very good question .,technology
and i think the the answer to that is we look at the history of the cosmos until today and it is say let call it our universe to be concrete .,technology
thirteen.eight billion year .,technology
and we look at life on planet earth and it is a handful of billion of year old .,technology
in a handful of billion of year you can go from some complex molecule to human being .,technology
ill tell you say it it is not that long .,technology
it is not that long because imagine that life began a few billion year earlier in some other system star and galaxy .,technology
they were starting up a billion year after the big bank .,technology
it could be that life in other world ha a head start on u by a few billion year .,technology
and we know what can happen in a few billion year .,technology
it can take u from single cell to u . sure .,technology
and you can imagine from a few billion year from now into the future it could be radically different .,technology
to say it is tenzero year ahead of u that to me would be the unexplained coincidence .,technology
how unlikely that they started and we started with them tenzero year in the span of billion of year .,technology
that seems unlikely is not it ?,technology
doe it seem unlikely when you are talking about the infinite size of the universe and this perhaps an infinite number of brian greenschild that they are talking to an infinite number of me ?,technology
good point .,technology
good point .,technology
you are absolutely .,technology
we are almost guaranteed if the spatial expansion of the universe is infinitely long .,technology
there are going to be place where it is within tenzero year .,technology
but those are going to be a very small number compared to the place where it is not tenzero year .,technology
is that true or would it be an infinite number of them ?,technology
it is the infinite number at all .,technology
but they are different kind of infinity .,technology
you mean in the space of the exact scope of the universe itself a small number relatively speaking to where we are .,technology
i would say it is different .,technology
id say look at a finite size ball in this large spatial expansion .,technology
everythings finite .,technology
let get a five billion light year ball. . and within that ball the number that are differing from u by tenzero year would be very very small compared to the number differing from u by say a billion year or a couple of billion year .,technology
then simply by the law of number .,technology
if we imagine that the random process that are now there could be some physical principle that prevents life from emerging before say four billion year ago .,technology
and if thats the case and we are not aware of that principle then youd be absolutely that wed all be roughly at the same starting point .,technology
and there no reason to respect that they would be far ahead of u . but i do not know of any such principle .,technology
but yeah you almost have a reductionist view of this ?,technology
if you had a guess if you had a hundred dollar to bet ha alien life ever observed u you would say no .,technology
by observed you mean could it turn a big telescope in our direction and gather some radio wave ?,technology
but yes i would take that bet .,technology
because frankly weve only been generating radio wave for the last seventy year .,technology
we examined those planet from vast distance away .,technology
and wouldnt you assume that a life form that is perhaps thousand of year more advanced than u with the exponential increase in technology ?,technology
if they ever got to the point where we are that they would see these goldilocks planet a . and recognize that earth is one of them .,technology
however if they are far away they are going to be examining earth a it wa hundred of thousand or million of billion of year ago .,technology
if you truly want them to be examining u in the sense of human presence on planet earth then it is a much more difficult proposition to imagine that theyve been doing this .,technology
is it possible there another way to examine thing where you are not hampered by the speed of not that i know of ?,technology
any signal in the world that we are aware of is restricted by a special theory by the speed of travel which is now look there quantum entanglement which is a strange property of the quantum world .,technology
and which disan object can behave a if they are one .,technology
and in some sense respond instantaneously to an influence in one location at a distant location no matter how far apart they are .,technology
but that is not observing .,technology
that more thats more realizing correlation between physical property at why these separated location .,technology
but i am not aware of a mean of leveraging that to observe whats happening in some distant location even if you do have quantum entanglement particle .,technology
for a long time my operating theory on alien wa when i see something thats interesting then i am going to pay attention to it. . because it is too attractive .,technology
and it is a part of the thing of whether it is ramptha or any of these wonky thing .,technology
there something about woo woo stuff whether it is psychic or channel thats attractive to people .,technology
some a weird way .,technology
and is our alien .,technology
the idea that if we were visited by something from another world some far advanced space daddy or whatever it is that come down here and is going to show u the way .,technology
thats attractive that it i think it mess with your ordinary ability to observe and to objectively analyze whats real and whats not .,technology
i agree with that .,technology
and i think it is an unfortunate feature of the human mind that we tend to look outward for weirdness that will inject into the world more than the every day that we experience through common everyday encounter .,technology
we want there to be more .,technology
we do not want it to be. . that we are on this rock around this planet and we live for a while and then we are gone .,technology
we want it to be more than that .,technology
and we imagine that there some answer floating out there in the cosmos .,technology
maybe that will be brought down to earth through our space daddy a you refer to it .,technology
and my view of that is it is much more noble to recognize that there is no answer floating out there in space .,technology
there no space daddy thats going to come here and say this is what it is all about .,technology
the answer is you and i and everybody else we manufacture our own meaning we manufacture our own purpose and how much better is it that we come up with the our own meaning than having a bestowed or forced upon u by some external entity .,technology
i do not think that diminishes thing .,technology
i think it aggrandizes them because it is coming ultimately from ourselves .,technology
that make a lot of sense .,technology
i think the hope is that space daddy going to prevent nuclear war and figure out how to fix the ocean .,technology
yeah sure .,technology
and that i could that i could certainly imagine happen .,technology
there knowledge out there in the world that you could imagine that that we have in yet encountered that we could make use of .,technology
but the other thing thats worth keeping in mind and this i think is surprising to some people you can do a calculation a to whether consciousness can itself persist indefinitely in the universe .,technology
you can ask yourself sure earth mego way you and i were going to go away .,technology
we recognize all this .,technology
but is it possible that some conscious being can continue to cojitate indefinitely far into the future ?,technology
or it is progeny continue to cojitate .,technology
and you can pretty much establish that thought itself will come to an end in this universe .,technology
thought itself is a limited lifetime phenomenon in the cosmos .,technology
when at least our universe ?,technology
i am going to focus on our relationship .,technology
if we are going to break down a proton when we get to that point there no room for thought .,technology
no thats part of it .,technology
i am willing to posit that in order to be a general a possible .,technology
the process of thought itself in the far future will generate too much heat for that being to be able to release that heat to the environment and to avoid burning up in it own waste .,technology
when you think you will fry dude .,technology
how is everything ?,technology
it is a selfcentered when you think of the infinite universe .,technology
we are to finite being sitting in the valley in front of a wooden desk .,technology
it is weird that we think about it is important that everything doe .,technology
we are here for a brief moment of cosmic time and thats all there is to it .,technology
and some will feel my god thats disturbing thats distressing .,technology
my point is hey extol celebrate the fact that you are here for this brief .,technology
think about the collection of quantum event stretching back from the big bang until today that had to turn out exactly a they did for you and for me to exist .,technology
each one of these quantum event and there are nearly infinitely many of them could have turned out that way instead of this yielding a universe which neither you nor i nor anybody else would be here and yet against those astounding odds .,technology
astounding odds were here .,technology
that is cause for celebration and you can go further not only over here we can figure out how we got here .,technology
we can create art .,technology
we can write the story that you are referring to .,technology
we can create comedy .,technology
we can build monument .,technology
we can create film .,technology
we can do thing that inanimate object can not .,technology
this to me is where the value and purpose and meaning come from a opposed to trying to look out and hope space daddy come with the answer of flashing in neon sign saying ha thats what it is all about .,technology
thats never going to happen .,technology
it is what it might .,technology
it might have to be yours .,technology
i admit that it is possible .,technology
every time i say it is not going to happen and likely that it is going to vary unlike yeah i agree with that .,technology
but it is interesting to me that thats the thing that we look forward to the most to the average person if they think about space .,technology
they think about intelligent life .,technology
that is far more interesting to them than the fact that there black hole out there that are devouring planet .,technology
there sucking star into it event horizon .,technology
this infinite point of density that we can not even begin to imagine with our own little brain .,technology
and the fact that all this arose without a guiding intelligence that there are black hole and there are active galactic nucleus .,technology
and there are black hole slamming into each other creating gravitational wave that we can detect .,technology
it is a wonderfully rich reality that we are fortunate to be part of .,technology
do you experience much pushback or much conflict from religious people who do not the fact that you described thing in that way that did not need an intelligent force or intelligent creator to tell you .,technology
it is an interesting question because the biological community people richard dawkins and the i think have born the brunt of the religious pushback because they are dealing directly with the phenomenon of life .,technology
and thats the precious commodity that somehow we want to be sacred .,technology
and therefore our religious sensibility will push back on it being the minus law of physic and evolution yielding life on planet earth .,technology
they havent pushed a hard on the quantum physicist and the cosmologist a they have on the biologist .,technology
but i have that conversation .,technology
many of them are respectful a opposed to antagonistic where the view is that i am wrongheaded that i am missing the point .,technology
and some of these religious folk are fantastically accomplice scientist .,technology
thats weird .,technology
i went to a gathering .,technology
i think i can talk about that and i wa closed or gathering .,technology
we werent meant to describe it .,technology
i wa open to myself .,technology
and i thought it wa science and spiritual quest .,technology
and it wa a bunch of scientist that were being brought together .,technology
and i thought it wa going to be an interesting but ultimately one note meeting .,technology
i thought everybodys going to say the same thing .,technology
there could be a god .,technology
there no evidence for a god .,technology
weve got the law of physic and we are going to press forward under the assumption that physic is all there is until the cloud part and god reveals him herself or itself to u . and at that point we may change our tune .,technology
it wa not one note .,technology
i wa the only person who had that perspective in the room .,technology
everybody else wa coming out religion from a very different way of thinking about the world .,technology
in fact there one noble laureate in the room who got up and sang song a part of his presentation .,technology
and i wa sitting there and i wa what is happening here ?,technology
this is unexpected to me .,technology
and what it meant wa i wa close mind it into the variety of religious engagement that happened in the world .,technology
and it opened my eye .,technology
and there one noble laureate in particular .,technology
i did say to him at the end .,technology
i said when you look at me and you hear my view what do you think ?,technology
and he put his arm around me in a funcular way and said your real smart guy and you do not understand the true reality .,technology
and i think ultimately you will because you are open minded .,technology
and you are on a journey and i hope that your journey will finally take it to the place where i have been for for many year .,technology
that wa unexpected .,technology
that there no bellloorate who i respected for his concrete mathematical and experimental work saw the world completely differently .,technology
no it wa the spectrum of belief .,technology
yeah absolutely .,technology
but i wa the one who wa far out .,technology
i wa the one who wa untethered .,technology
yeah i came in there and i wa whoa and and and and and and clearly they arranged the meeting to have a spectrum of perspective .,technology
this is not something that wa randomly designed and it happened .,technology
but it wa an eye opener .,technology
and from that i went to read william james book of variety of religious experience .,technology
no it is a book that william james great called wrote in one thousand nine hundred and two .,technology
and it wa based on a series of lecture .,technology
i think he gave in scotland .,technology
and it is the most heartfelt and rational approach to religion and science that i think ha ever been written .,technology
and yet most people do not know much about it .,technology
because what he doe is he go through and he document through his own research and through reading biography and interviewing individual the vastly different way that people think about religion and why they think about religion and the value that religion ha in their life .,technology
and and and when you read that book it doesnt convert me .,technology
i havent changed my view on whether or not there is a god .,technology
but it ha changed my view on the value of a religious sensibility .,technology
the role that a place in people life now look it can be talk to people sam harris and and it is a destructive force in the world .,technology
and it ha been a destructive force in some way .,technology
but thats not the full story .,technology
a full story is that for some individual it give a connection to a historical lineage thats deeply valued .,technology
for some individual it put their life in a larger setting that allows them to be in the world in a more productive way .,technology
there are a whole range of role that religious engagement can play .,technology
the problem is when you start to put it against scientific insight then you run into trouble .,technology
but religion wa never developed to give u factual information about the world .,technology
religion will never give u the electronic magnetic moment to nine decimal place .,technology
thats the purview of scientific investigation .,technology
if you can keep these straight in your mind there a definite and powerful role for a religious sensibility in the world .,technology
yeah i feel it give people in a lot of way of scaffolding for ethic and morality and allows them some alleviation of anxiety .,technology
yeah exactly .,technology
a feeling of purpose is but you said a long a it is not conflicting with the rigid scientific reality it is scientific provable scientific reality .,technology
yeah and i got ta tell you there a funny thing .,technology
richard dawkins i do not know .,technology
yeah i had him on the program .,technology
that his m.o .,technology
in the world is very antireligious .,technology
i think he would agree with me on that .,technology
i do not want to put word into his mouth .,technology
but i did a event with him in new york .,technology
the beacon theater .,technology
i do not know it wa maybe a year ago or something that .,technology
and it wa very interesting because in a oneonone conversation his view were very similar to mine .,technology
but i wa saying to him there are time i go around the world and i will do thing that are utterly irrational on knockon wood for good luck .,technology
ill speak to my dead father .,technology
i know that he not there .,technology
ill pray to god on occasion if i think that i could use that backup .,technology
not because i think there some bearded individual in the sky it is a behavioral tendency that i find to be comforting and useful .,technology
and i said this to richard .,technology
he said he said in fact he said i do not to sleep in a house that ha a reputation .,technology
and for me it wa such a beautiful human moment .,technology
it wa such a beautiful human moment where we were being human being .,technology
and he said and then they said we are both sinner .,technology
and i agree we are both sinner in that sense .,technology
because we know how the world work .,technology
we know this doesnt make any sense .,technology
and yes it is still part of somehow how we behave in the world .,technology
and i think there a value to recognizing that that is what it mean to be human .,technology
you will engage in the world in way that are not necessarily strictly adhering to some rational perspective of how the scientific world operates .,technology
i would love to see richard dawkins outside of a haunted house saying we are not going into it .,technology
it is all to say that i feel there are many pathway toward insight in the world .,technology
there are many way to come to term with our own impermanence .,technology
and it is not a though something is or something is wrong .,technology
it is a question of is not it useful to you ?,technology
and i think that we have to be very openminded in the kind of behavior that we allow to happen in the world. ?,technology
even romped it is not a stuff .,technology
but if some of those individual who go there find that it allows them to live in the world in a more productive way alleviating anxiety feeling they are on a spiritual quest .,technology
thats the thing thats something .,technology
it is hard for people to understand if you are not in that space that head space that they are .,technology
you do not need this structure .,technology
but for some people even scientology or something along those line it seems loopy on paper can provide them with legitimate structure and benefit their life .,technology
and a tangible way they can describe to you .,technology
and my feeling is that if there wa i do not know this to the case and maybe some biologist will push back on this .,technology
i think it is the latter group that ultimately would triumph because with that freedom of thought you get novelty you get ingenuity you get creativity .,technology
and i feel a though this is part and parcel of who we are and why we have survived .,technology
and to come at the world with a scientific club thats meant to smash away anything that disagrees with the scientific world view is an unfortunate way of looking at the world .,technology
there something about creativity that it doesnt necessarily have to abide by any law of logic and it can still be beneficial .,technology
and thats why it is stunning when somebody come up with something thats where did that come from ?,technology
it did not come from a rational approach to working out brahmsthird symphony .,technology
it emerged from the churning emotion of an individual who happens to be made up of trillion of particle guided by physical law responding to the environment which is impinging his sens with an incredible array of influence and through that world emerges the spectacular piece of music .,technology
thats breathtaking .,technology
utdally breathtaking .,technology
and it is amazing what that music can inspire .,technology
a it reach out to x amount of people and then cause different thought in their mind .,technology
and then that cause in turn another branch of creativity another new line of thinking that they might have ever never pursued before .,technology
and thats to me establishes that the notion that language is the only way that we can know about the world .,technology
vic and stein had this perspective not the limit of my language limit of my world .,technology
that seems to me utterly wrong .,technology
the experience of music or the experience of cogitating about the world but not trying to overlay a narrative upon it feeling your way into reality reveals thing about the world that i think are beyond linguistic .,technology
do you ever listen to music when you are pondering an equation or whether you are going over a problem ?,technology
it is an interesting question .,technology
when i wa in college i couldnt have any sound on when i wa trying to say learn quantum mechanic or relativity .,technology
but i would find that it would capture my brain too fully and i couldnt focus on the equation that i wa trying to understand .,technology
but the funny thing is in writing this book for the very first time i found that there were passage that i couldnt write if it wa quiet .,technology
i needed to have music playing because in some sense by focusing too directly on what i wa trying to say i couldnt say it .,technology
i only found that i could make progress in certain kind of description by allowing my brain to fly off through whatever musical experience i wa playing and allowing the freedom of thought to then emerge within that unusual for me environment .,technology
what music it varied incredibly a lot of slayer ?,technology
no some of it wa classical .,technology
i remember there one vital passage when i wa writing word .,technology
they are a spectacular occapella group who are able to take song that you have heard and transform them into transcendent performance .,technology
you should check these guy out .,technology
but other time it would be loud rock loud beetle loud rolling stone .,technology
the soundtrack from the greatest showman blaring that thing and somehow it allowed me a certain linguistic freedom that i could not acquire in my normal way of being in the world which is everyones quiet .,technology
let me work out my equation and i need total focus and no distraction .,technology
is this something that you evolved of the course of your career ?,technology
it wa not there early on .,technology
and there this phenomenon .,technology
i do not know if this is anything more than a metaphor or an analogy but whatever .,technology
there are certain thing in the night sky that you can not see if you look at them directly .,technology
but by looking off access you are able to invoke other quality of the eye that are able to sense those feature of the night sky .,technology
and i feel it is the same thing .,technology
sometimes by focusing directly on what you want to do you can not do it .,technology
and youve got to look obliquely .,technology
youve got to look off access metaphorically .,technology
and thats the only way that you can accomplish what you set out to do .,technology
and certainly music is one of the way to take one attention and shift it in a different direction to get that oblique view of what it is that you are trying to do .,technology
and i have found that it allows for progress that otherwise is unattainable .,technology
and is that the case also when you were writing this book ?,technology
it wa absolutely wa a case writing this book .,technology
there i have a very wife is very understanding .,technology
we have a house up we live in manhattan in in mac columbia .,technology
but she would let me go up to our house upstate with the dog and by myself .,technology
and id hold myself up in this cabin in the wood .,technology
and i would sometimes write deep into the night .,technology
and there were no neighbor around .,technology
i could turn on the music .,technology
i would ever volume my found useful .,technology
and i would do it .,technology
and i would find that it freed up a certain creative thought process that to me wa striking because i had never approached work in that way before .,technology
and it wa deeply interesting .,technology
how did you come to this idea of doing it that way of ?,technology
i wa struggling on certain thing .,technology
and i felt a though i am approaching this in a very flatfooted way .,technology
i want to write about this .,technology
say i want about write about human creativity .,technology
i want to write about religious engagement .,technology
and i am doing what ive always done which is i have this equation .,technology
and i want to solve it .,technology
i am going to bring the tool of mathematics to bear to solve it .,technology
and i wa approaching this writing project and exactly the same mind frame .,technology
and a it wasnt working i said let me smack my brain around a little bit .,technology
and one way of it could be psychedelics .,technology
i did not go that direction .,technology
but i smacked it around by forcing myself to be subject to a great deal of distraction in the environment around me .,technology
and it made a difference .,technology
it is interesting that you did it in a calculated manner .,technology
yeah i can not break free fully from my my physicist training .,technology
but it is wise .,technology
that that way of doing it is and it is also a time tested from from the road to beginning of the game .,technology
and the fun of it is you never worked for me in the past because the focus i think when i am doing mathematics it doe need at least for me personally to be that nondistracted total focus on whats going on .,technology
a a writer it is a very romantic notion too .,technology
to go to the wood and a cabin thats whats up. . thats what everybody want to do .,technology
yeah . . exactly .,technology
when it is missing his whiskey i supposed to get drunk out there .,technology
yeah that i did not .,technology
i had the dog and it is i said i hardly ever drink .,technology
but it wa an unusual creative experience which to me opened up a different way of going about trying to create thing in the world .,technology
a you write more and more book you find it to be more and more difficult or defunded to be easier .,technology
my early book were all focused on trying to bring scientific idea out to the general public .,technology
and the elk in universe wa about strength theory fabric the cosmos space and time .,technology
hidden reality is about multiple universe .,technology
and in that role i am trying to translate from the cutting edge research into ordinary human language that people who do not want to go to graduate school can get the basic idea of whats going on .,technology
in this book it wa a very different proposition .,technology
i feel ive moved in a in a in a significantly different direction through this book because yes there science entropy evolution the history of the universe in the beginning to the end .,technology
it wa a harder exercise than anything that i did before because it wa a different exercise .,technology
but in the end one that i felt wa even more gratifying because it wa making clear why these idea matter .,technology
a opposed to trying to tickle the brain of the reader i am trying to if you will touch the heart and soul of the reader .,technology
and thats something which if it is successful feel very gratifying .,technology
i want to imagine that would be very hard to end to feel how to put the cover on it and to go thats it .,technology
yeah it is .,technology
and i thought thats your almost with with all book the the famous adage is that you never finish a book you abandoned them .,technology
i know thats all that ever happens .,technology
and that wa true in spade in this particular case because the subject wa big .,technology
and you can always imagine going further in this direction or enhancing that description .,technology
but at some point you recognize that life is an ongoing process .,technology
and a book is ultimately a snapshot of where the author wa at the moment that the book wa written .,technology
and that to me is what happens here .,technology
this is a snapshot of my view of the human condition set against the cosmological unfolding .,technology
and how much of your perception of these thing ha evolved a an educator and a a scientist and a a person who in the public eye how much of your perception on these idea have changed over the course of your career ?,technology
i think i wa a very hard nose science thinker when i started at i think part of this may have been i became a professor at relatively young age .,technology
i think it wa twenty seven when i got my first faculty job .,technology
many of the grabbed student were the same age a me .,technology
i think i felt the need to have a very rigid scientific outlook on the world because of that .,technology
and a ive gotten older that ha changed .,technology
and my willingness to entertain a broader range of thought and experience in way of being ha a absolutely grown .,technology
the other thing thats had a vast and vital impact on mere student .,technology
for thirty year the only thing i taught wa technical physic course quantum mechanic or relativity thermodynamics and what do you do there ?,technology
you are at the blackboard you are putting equation up there you are trying to get the kid to be able to solve problem and understand what the mathematics is all about .,technology
the only thing that everyone is touching the cognitive part of their brain .,technology
for the last few year ive been teaching of course the student did not know it .,technology
thats based on this book .,technology
i wanted to try out the idea with young mind .,technology
i taught of course a clinical origin in meaning .,technology
and in that course i had student from across the campus not the physic student the neuro student the anthropology student the linguistic student the theological or it wa a whole range of student .,technology
and to see how their understanding of how their major or subject fit in to the cosmological unfolding changed many of their perspective on what it is that they are studying and what they are doing .,technology
and to have student come to my office and to feel shook and up shaken up whatever the form of that verb is where they are saying ive lived my life in such a way .,technology
and some of them frankly would be upset at head student come in tear .,technology
and id never had them when i teach quantum mechanic more than one more than one because theyd say this course is shaking my sense of who i am and what i am in the world .,technology
what wa the key aspect of it that wa shaking them ?,technology
for some student it wa the wa the notion of religion because many of them or the sum of them had a traditional religious upbringing and their academic life and their religious life for completely separate .,technology
and i wa in a position that id never been before of counseling a student and saying hey it is to have your world shake a little bit .,technology
it is to think about thing that you may come back to exactly where you were before this course .,technology
but if a collection of idea can make you rethink your life at least itll cast it in a different light .,technology
itll illuminate it differently .,technology
go with it see what happens .,technology
and i never had a conversation that when teaching schroedon gris equation and for me it is the most gratifying pedagogical experience that ive ever had because you are reaching the whole person a opposed to reaching this cognitive technique of solving equation .,technology
if you can talk religion with a intelligent person who objective who ha a belief it is such an interesting subject because it requires suspension of disbelief in order to absorb some of the story .,technology
but there clearly a history behind this of thousand of year of translation and you are trying to get to the what did they mean when they wrote this down ?,technology
yeah how much did they know ?,technology
and what were they trying to do ?,technology
were they trying to get everybody to calm down and stay in line ? ?,technology
or were they trying to find some mean of gluing the group together by a shared piece ?,technology
or they are folk who say that there are quality of the human brain that naturally leave it open to a religious sensibility .,technology
for instance we have agency detection system in our brain where we look around the world and we tend to assign agency to thing that happen .,technology
thats useful ?,technology
because if you mistake a windblown branch for a jaguar yeah it is fine .,technology
you thought it wa jaguar but it wa a branch .,technology
but if the reverse happens you think it wa a jaguar and you think it is a windblown branch .,technology
you are going to get eaten .,technology
we tend to overend out agency into the world .,technology
there is evolutionary value to that .,technology
when the wind blow we tend to think there a mind up there .,technology
when the river gurgle we tend to think that there a mind in there .,technology
and this is the seed for the kind of perspective that you find in many of the world religion .,technology
there natural course of event that can lead to a rising of the institution or at least the idea is behind the institution of religion .,technology
and for a student that have never encountered that idea before it can shake thing up and i think in a very valuable way .,technology
i think you are absolutely having a conversation with somebody who ha a religious perspective is deeply interesting to understand where that mind came to the place that it got to .,technology
and from a personal sensibility i give you one little anecdote .,technology
i wa twenty three year old .,technology
and unexpectedly id been visiting home .,technology
i wa at harvard at the time .,technology
i wa visiting from cambridge and we had a nice weekend .,technology
and by the time i got back to cambridge on the bus my mom called me said dad dead .,technology
it wa shocking .,technology
it wa and i remember i went back home .,technology
and my dad wa not a religious man but we knew that he would want to have a religious ceremony .,technology
and we had a million of jew coming to the house to recite the cottage prayer .,technology
and i had no idea what these men were saying .,technology
but it wa deeply comforting .,technology
in fact i did not want to know what they were saying .,technology
to me it wa a collection of ancient sound .,technology
but the sound connected me across the generation to a culture that had been extended back fivezero year .,technology
and in a moment of crisis that wa a very comforting and useful connection to have .,technology
yeah that is where i find people get the most out of religion .,technology
and in the fact that it brings community together in this cohesive ritual .,technology
everybody act together and everybody .,technology
you feel there completion to it .,technology
you are putting someone in the perspective and you are doing with this religious ceremony .,technology
and when large group of people get together and engage in a ritual behavior something magical happens .,technology
ive spoken to evolutionary psychologist steve pinker who is a wonderful thinker .,technology
and steve is skeptical that this ritual behavior can yield the cohesive bonding that some people suggest that it doe .,technology
but you probably have i have the on occasion engaged in these ritual behavior .,technology
mass drumming and movement .,technology
and i got to tell you you are quickly i find transported to a place where you are now part of a collective and you feel yourself melting into the group .,technology
and you are one .,technology
and if youve never had that experience i think it is something that you should have because i think it is a vital part of our heritage .,technology
it is part of how we got to be who we are .,technology
yeah there something about group acceptance and a group of people acting and doing something together that doe create this very strange bond .,technology
yeah it doesnt necessarily exist amongst individual .,technology
it is a weird bond .,technology
it is a very weird bond because it ha nothing to do with the individual .,technology
nothing to do with the personality of jim or mary .,technology
it is irrelevant at that point .,technology
it is somehow joining you together into this massive humanity thats all engaged in the same practice and somehow you feel a though you are identity melt into the larger hole .,technology
i do not know why it happens .,technology
there negative aspect to that course .,technology
of course .,technology
for that yeah mob mentality .,technology
of course .,technology
i give you ever been in a situation where thing got chaotic and you had this feeling anything can happen in the moment .,technology
ive never been part of it .,technology
but i have a feeling in the air .,technology
yeah i havent been an alga one which is my brother is a harry christna .,technology
and he is thirteen year old in the may and left college in the 60 which wa a tumultuous time and went to europe and ultimately joined into what many people think of a some cultish activity .,technology
and but he not a cult thinker .,technology
he an original thinker .,technology
he a brilliant thinker .,technology
and yet within this group mentality you can imagine a certain group think can take over at least people imagine that this happens .,technology
yes it ha positive aspect .,technology
and it can have negative aspect .,technology
but in the end i think there is a long lineage in which those of our forebear who survived were the one who could join together into these more potent these more powerful group .,technology
and that way we are able to triumph over other group in the ancestral environment .,technology
there different reading of the archeological record .,technology
whether it wa a dangerous place in the hunter gatherer past or a plastic place .,technology
but one reading say it wa a very dangerous place .,technology
and therefore those group that survived were the one who were able to establish this allegiance to the whole .,technology
and certainly i think this ritual behavior may have been part of that .,technology
bond together through shared experience .,technology
and if you are all believing in the same supernatural entity thats a powerful imprensible powerful glue .,technology
do you find that there i do not want to say an arrogance in some academic maybe it is on the word .,technology
but this being too quick to dismiss any positive benefit at all about religion .,technology
it is the knee jerk reaction among a certain group of academic .,technology
and it feel deeply unfortunate to me .,technology
it almost feel a religion of it own sort when it is the response a opposed to a careful thoughtful heartfelt analysis of the situation .,technology
i frankly wish that more people would read william james book .,technology
because i do think that it is the because here a scientist ?,technology
a deeply thoughtful scientist who know how to analyze data know how to rationally engage with the world who wa plumbing the depth of religion in a very very meaningful and sensitive way .,technology
by the end of these lecture though i think it is lecture number twenty or something he describes religion a this a something that help the journey toward the the terror and the beauty of phenomenon .,technology
he describes it a the the voice of the thunder the gentleness of the summer rain .,technology
he described it in term of the subliminative of the star .,technology
and this transcendent approach to the religious experience .,technology
i think brings it out of the academic guy that ha often thrown upon it which is something that is contravening everything we know about the world .,technology
it is causing people to think in way that are irrational .,technology
this whole trope that you hear it is not that there is not some truth to that but it is an incomplete truth .,technology
and if you are willing to approach religion in a way where you discard the piece that offend you throw away the part that you think are utter nonsense only keep those aspect that are useful to you in your life then there is a place for it .,technology
i think they are in lie of problem with a lot of people .,technology
they are not willing to do that. . this need for suspension of disbelief trouble them much that they feel fool if they buy into something. . and we are also dealing with all religion except the one that are super questionable scientology or mormonism that are very old .,technology
and having these environment were loving conscious people communicate with each other in a very positive way that this could be a new form of this thing that we seem to desire greatly .,technology
and i agree .,technology
and i have to say i make this point in the book .,technology
because the point that i make there is that to truly engage with the world you have to use a variety of story .,technology
we are fundamentally storyteller .,technology
thats what human being are .,technology
now there the reduction of story that physicist are equipped to talk about with particle and law of physic .,technology
on top of that youve got the chemist story the complex molecule .,technology
youve got the biology story that begin to talk about cell in life .,technology
youve got the psychological story the neurophysical logical story that brings a mind in consciousness .,technology
and within that you then have all of the activity that conscious being undertake which includes religion and includes telling other kind of story .,technology
and includes creative expression .,technology
you need them all .,technology
and to say that the scientific account is the only account by which you are ever going to gain true quality of the world a a very in my view limited description of what truth is .,technology
there is objective truth in the world that we can measure that we can describe with equation of selfworth .,technology
but there also internal truth spiritual truth that you get to by selfexamination .,technology
it is real in the sense that you are understanding how you respond to the world .,technology
and that is something which is deeply personal but utterly real .,technology
and whether it is through psychedelics whether siwaiwasko whether through a spiritual journey whether it is through religion regardless all of this add color to the story of what it mean to be a human being .,technology
do you spend any time meditating ?,technology
i am not particularly effective at it .,technology
and most people are that way .,technology
but year ago effective once ?,technology
year ago a friend of mine bought me one of these transcendental meditation course .,technology
and i wa ill try it .,technology
he spent the money .,technology
and it wa eyeopening .,technology
there wa a lot of what you might call wu wu stuff that wa happening in the lecture .,technology
and in fact the funnest thing is the guy given the lecture he did recognize me .,technology
and you could tell how uncomfortable he wa giving his normal description because he kept looking at me sheepously a he invoked quantum physic and thing of that sort. . but i wa i told him ive do whatever this i am not here to judge you .,technology
i am here to if he wa going on .,technology
but the idea of allowing the mind to be in a different mode of operation which is how i summarized the experience .,technology
and i think that to me is the devaluer of it .,technology
it is a systematic way to put your mind in a different mode of operation .,technology
and at time i find it very useful to move into that place .,technology
when you started doing transatlamentation what about it wa weird ?,technology
what wa weird ?,technology
number one wa doing this in this in this group setting which is how you start on this course .,technology
and moreover it being framed in a manner that i had trouble aligning with my understanding of how the world work by virtue of the lecture that were given to u for what it is what we are doing .,technology
but through the practice i found i am sure i am translating from what they were saying in the lecture into a language that i am more comfortable with .,technology
and that made it le weird for me .,technology
because of what you are talking about religion cutting out the thing that did not make any sense to me and saying hey what is this about ?,technology
what this is about is breaking the usual chain of thought that is ninety nine.nine of the time of how i live in the world and allowing my brain to have a chain of thought that is artificial .,technology
because i am sitting here forcing myself to recite this mantra inside my mind .,technology
but thats a very useful way of being because it is unfamiliar and it is novel and allows my brain to operate in a different way .,technology
when i translated into that language it all of a sudden made a lot more sense to me and became not weird at all .,technology
it became an interesting practice .,technology
and do you still do it ?,technology
either friend of mine who say i can not live in the world if i do not do my twenty minute in the morning .,technology
simply thats part of my routine .,technology
i do not feel that way .,technology
but there are moment when i say whoa i need to do it .,technology
and based on circumstance based on whats happening to given moment it allows a mental reset if thats a language that make sense .,technology
and that reset i consider to be a valuable thing to do .,technology
and i also have a float tank here .,technology
in this building ?,technology
yeah thats over there .,technology
ill show it to you after we are done .,technology
what can i do it ?,technology
have you done it before ?,technology
i find it a little bit terrifying .,technology
yeah there plenty of them .,technology
there a bunch of different float place .,technology
it is not terrifying at all. ?,technology
yeah you float relax .,technology
but it is complete darkness .,technology
because i have some claustrophobia .,technology
and thats for instance i can not go into an mri machine. ?,technology
yeah yeah. . and thats what you want to try .,technology
why do you get that out of your head ?,technology
i have a desk in my office where it is only about one foot high .,technology
and id slide my body underneath the desk close lock the door because i am too weird .,technology
and id stay under there a long a i possibly could to train myself .,technology
fifteen twenty but i get into the real machine and .,technology
my wife mom wa that .,technology
she did not mri and shes it wa the worst experience of my life .,technology
i did two of them last week .,technology
i do not understand why someone a smart a you would not recognize .,technology
there let take around me and i do .,technology
but it is the irrational part of the thing .,technology
i get in there .,technology
my heart start to pound .,technology
when i think that come from i do not know because it wasnt always there .,technology
and it ha gotten worse in certains .,technology
there wa a time again it is going to come across a nut case .,technology
maybe it wa that trip to amsterdam .,technology
yeah i missed her .,technology
it wa a way to bring her out .,technology
there wa time when i couldnt even go in a tunnel in a car .,technology
the cluster phobia wa that bad. ?,technology
i had to go to new jersey manhattan .,technology
and a the taxi approaching the tunnel i said the guy i can not do it .,technology
and the guy say i can not let you out .,technology
it is illegal to let you out .,technology
and i opened the door and i got out .,technology
thats crazy .,technology
but now we find with tunnel .,technology
i do not know what it is that maybe you are too smart .,technology
it is more accentuated it there .,technology
and maybe you are playing trick with you and giving you anxiety to shake it up the world .,technology
yeah maybe you are maybe constantly contemplating the gigantic picture of actual scope of the universe .,technology
but now i am pretty stable about these thing .,technology
it is mri machine .,technology
it is close into your face .,technology
you got to do a lot of mri .,technology
get over the exact .,technology
i am sure that that would do it .,technology
that would absolutely do it .,technology
if you still mri on a regular basis .,technology
then i am sure you get used to it .,technology
but yeah i i do a real simple type of meditation .,technology
when i i probably eventually going to take a tm course because my friend tom papa he a into tm and he he raf about it .,technology
but i sit down and i breathe .,technology
i concentrate only on my breath .,technology
and i and it come in go but i concentrate only on my breath .,technology
and i find good relief from that yoga is the same thing .,technology
i try to do at least twice a week when i do .,technology
that there a lot of benefit in that in the same way .,technology
in that it is difficult .,technology
and in the pose .,technology
if you can only concentrate on your breath .,technology
balance and concentrate on your breath .,technology
youll be filled with activity and enough with the with thing to concentrate on with the balancing of the posture and then the breath that it it act a a almost a brain scouring .,technology
it clean the mind of unnecessary anxiety and a lot of other but youve been doing that for a long time .,technology
no yoga ha been ive been pretty steady for the last four year .,technology
she keep telling me that i need to do it .,technology
it is great .,technology
it is great .,technology
it is great for the body a . and i think the more comfortable your body is the better you are at least for me .,technology
the better my mind got a little doubt .,technology
thats good .,technology
but then i hurryed at a disk in my back and it is for last two month .,technology
ive been unable to move .,technology
i think it wa thrown out the christmas tree .,technology
the bending end and my ninety two year old mother ha used his opportunity to say because we are in jewish .,technology
we were an allowed to have a christmas tree going up .,technology
this is this is this is meaningful here .,technology
my my christian wife is all too happy that that i am flexible on that count for sure .,technology
what is going on with your back now ?,technology
it is it is bad .,technology
it is bad .,technology
i am i am this is pushing it is the nerve pushing it is the nerve .,technology
have you heard of something called regeneranachine ?,technology
do what that mean ?,technology
regenicine is something that i used for a bulging desk and it is incredibly beneficial .,technology
it is it wa created by a doctor in germany and it wa illegal in the united state until a few year back .,technology
they they move the process of here .,technology
it is not covered by insurance but it is very very beneficial for that .,technology
and what they do is it is essentially a more advanced version of platelet rich plasma .,technology
they take your blood out .,technology
they do this process .,technology
it take about twelve hour and then they re inject this serum .,technology
they take the serum out of the blood .,technology
it look this yellow serum and they inject it directly into the area and it is into the spine .,technology
into the area where the spine is bulging .,technology
although and it allows it to relax .,technology
it is the most potent antiinflammation drug that they can they can use .,technology
it is instead of cortisome which is exactly what they are talking about .,technology
cortisome can help you a . at least provide temporary relief .,technology
but what this doe is heals the area. ?,technology
it is very beneficial .,technology
i had a real bad bulging disk in my neck that wa making my hand go numb .,technology
my toe are numb .,technology
but they can give you relief .,technology
and it is in santa monica .,technology
there a place called lifespan medicine .,technology
ill connect you to the doctor .,technology
yeah i am curious about what it is .,technology
i said a friend of mine .,technology
he had a real problem with his neck within two week .,technology
he got hit by a car when he wa on his motorcycle .,technology
my friend dean del rey and he wa fucked up .,technology
his back wa bad that we were at the communist party and i am people came near him and he tensed up whats the matter ?,technology
my neck is messed up .,technology
i am in sharp pain .,technology
and then he started describing to me .,technology
i said ive got the thing for you .,technology
and i sent him to this place .,technology
ive had it done several time .,technology
ive had it done on my lower .,technology
a lot of athlete peyton manning and kobe bryant they they flew to germany to get this procedure done because it is a place to sleep a little bit .,technology
including the ufc president dana white which is where i found out about it .,technology
and then i found out that they were opening office in america and dallas they have one they have one in santa monica and i think somewhere else .,technology
yeah but it is an amazing procedure .,technology
it is super beneficial particularly for that an issue .,technology
because it is been tough .,technology
for instance i can not sleep because there no position .,technology
now the value of that is i have done much reading over the last two month because i am up half the night and i only can not count out when it is utter utter exhaustion .,technology
but then you spinal decompression of youve ever done either .,technology
i went to this physical therapy place where they put me up on pulley and it pulled the foot i guess away from the back .,technology
it wasnt being stretched fully but your own weight wa causing the vertebraid to separate .,technology
did that help ?,technology
yeah that you can get a small inversion table .,technology
yeah thinking about that .,technology
yeah i have one of here .,technology
you could do it too .,technology
there another thing called the reverse hyper machine .,technology
and the reverse hyper machine wa created by this these are very famous power lifter named louis simmons and louis had this idea .,technology
he a very brilliant guy and he had this idea that they were trying to fuse his disc .,technology
he had a bulging disc .,technology
he said a disc is compressed .,technology
how do you get it to decompress ?,technology
and he developed a machine that strengthens the back when you lift up the leg but then in the lowering of the leg it provides active decompression .,technology
and it alleviated his problem .,technology
do you wear this ?,technology
no ill show too .,technology
ill show it to you afterwards .,technology
it is a machine that you get .,technology
but see we are physical being ?,technology
we have a mind that can the edge of the cosmos but you got a bulging disc .,technology
yeah it is real .,technology
you have to deal with it .,technology
and you have to be careful .,technology
and for me whats critical is physical maintenance .,technology
and i am very dedicated to physical maintenance even if there nothing wrong .,technology
yes not .,technology
it is absolutely vital because the last few month have been hell .,technology
i have to say show you .,technology
listen weve very talked for two and a half hour .,technology

welcome to your deep dive into the ipad air 4th generation .,technology
you send over some pretty cool source for this when weve got a full review the spec list .,technology
and even a little peek into the blog where it life .,technology
i love that you included the blog .,technology
it give u a sense of the real world experience beyond the technical stuff .,technology
today we wan na give you that aha feeling about this ipad air .,technology
well go beyond rattling off feature .,technology
yeah and with the blog we can see how it performs out in the wild .,technology
love that .,technology
let start with first impression .,technology
this ipad air i got ta say the design is sleek modern clean line thin bezel .,technology
and youve got five color option silver space gray rose gold in green and sky blue .,technology
it is interesting how apple show that flat edge design back in two thousand and twenty .,technology
it wa a departure from the previous generation and it kinda mirrored the look of the iphones from around that time .,technology
it is a statement piece for sure .,technology
and speaking of look you mentioned in your note that you read a lot on your tablet .,technology
this ten.nine inch liquid retina display i think is a game changer for that .,technology
it is not the size though ?,technology
the two thousand three hundred and sixty by one thousand six hundred and forty resolution if you are packing a lot of pixel in there .,technology
but for me it is the true tone technology that stand out .,technology
yeah fill me in on that .,technology
the screen it adjusts the color temperature based on the ambient light .,technology
whether you are outside on a sunny day or curled up in bed at night the display adapts .,technology
make for comfortable viewing .,technology
no more eye strain during those late night reading session .,technology
thats awesome .,technology
speaking of working behind the scene let talk about the a14 bionic chip the brain of this ipad air .,technology
this chip it wa a beast when it came out and it still hold up .,technology
keep in mind this wa the same chip in the iphone twelve lineup .,technology
apple they werent messing around .,technology
for everyday use will i notice a difference ?,technology
remember those photo editing apps you mentioned ?,technology
this chip can handle those no problem .,technology
it is all thanks to that five millimeter architecture .,technology
imagine shrinking all the component down to a microscopic level .,technology
you are packing more power more efficiency into a tiny space .,technology
it is squeezing a super computer onto a chip the size of my fingernail .,technology
now i am curious about this neural engine in the spec .,technology
what is that all about ?,technology
it is having a coprocessor dedicated to ai .,technology
it handle machine learning image recognition which might not sound exciting but it make a huge difference in how the ipad performs and learns .,technology
starting to get the bigger picture it is not raw power it is intelligent power .,technology
exactly the neural engine it help improve handwriting recognition with the apple pencil .,technology
it learns your style make the whole thing feel more natural .,technology
let move on to something a bit more tangible those camera .,technology
the ipad air 4th gen it is got a twelve mp rear camera shoot 4k video at sixty frame per second .,technology
for a tablet thats pretty impressive open up possibility for content creation beyond your casual snapshot .,technology
and for video call that seven mp front camera should be more than enough .,technology
you mentioned in your blog post about wanting to start a podcast .,technology
i think this camera would be great for video recording .,technology
for sure the quality is definitely there .,technology
and do not forget about the audio .,technology
this ipad air it support dolby atmos .,technology
you get that immersive sound whether you are on a video call or watching a movie .,technology
sound tempting .,technology
tell me about the software .,technology
this ipad air it originally came with ipados fourteen that brought some cool feature to the table .,technology
ipados fourteen yeah that wa a big update .,technology
it wa redesigned widget you got the app library for organizing your apps and even better handwriting recognition with the apple pencil thanks to that neural engine we were talking about .,technology
that neural engine is working hard .,technology
it is it also power thing scribble .,technology
you can hand write text into any text field .,technology
and it is constantly learning making your ipad more personalized .,technology
the practical stuff battery life .,technology
how long can i use this thing ?,technology
apple say up to ten hour for browsing the web or watching video .,technology
but of course that depends on what you are doing .,technology
if you are constantly gaming or editing video that number might be a bit lower .,technology
and storage option .,technology
you got sixty four gb or two hundred and fifty six gb .,technology
sixty four gb might be for casual use but if you are storing a lot of photo video or big apps id go with the two hundred and fifty six gb .,technology
good to know .,technology
what are the starting price ?,technology
the wifi only model start at five hundred and ninety nine .,technology
and the wifi plus cellular version thats the one with the sim card slot start at seven hundred and twenty nine .,technology
all thats a solid overview of the ipad air itself .,technology
but you are also interested in accessory ?,technology
weve got a whole section dedicated to those in your deep dive ready to explore that world .,technology
absolutely let see how those accessory can transform the ipad air experience .,technology
let talk accessory .,technology
this is the fun part .,technology
all the cool gadget that can level up your tech experience .,technology
yeah the accessory they can make a big difference .,technology
especially with a device a versatile a the ipad air .,technology
first up the apple pencil .,technology
you mentioned being a visual learner liking to take note by hand .,technology
the second gen apple pencil it is magic for this ipad air .,technology
i love that .,technology
and it snap onto the side charge wirelessly always ready to go .,technology
but it is more than a stylus that pressure sensitivity tilt support it make it feel you are writing on real paper .,technology
ive heard that .,technology
people who say their handwriting even look better with the apple pencil .,technology
youll find that .,technology
it is definitely more precise .,technology
and ipad o it ha feature scribble .,technology
you can hand write text write into any app .,technology
it is not for note taking anymore .,technology
you could sketch idea annotate document even create artwork .,technology
i am sold but for those time you need a real keyboard writing a blog post or something longer .,technology
the magic keyboard the thing it transforms your ipad air turn it into a real productivity machine attache magnetically it is got a full size keyboard a track pad and it is responsive .,technology
i wa skeptical about using a tablet for serious work but the magic keyboard it changed my mind .,technology
the typing experience is great and the track pad it make navigating ipad o easy .,technology
you could write that blog post edit photo work on spreadsheet all from your couch a coffee shop wherever .,technology
and for something a bit lighter more portable there the smart keyboard folio .,technology
the smart keyboard folio it is a good option if portability is key .,technology
it is slimmer than the magic keyboard no track pad it is still comfy to type on and it fold up to protect your screen .,technology
a keyboard and a case all in one .,technology
audio can not forget that especially since you mentioned wanting to start a podcast .,technology
airpods seem the obvious choice .,technology
definitely the regular airpods or the airpods pro they both work great with the ipad air .,technology
you could listen to music while you work take call without bothering anyone or even use them for recording your podcasts .,technology
for podcasting those airpods pro with the noise canceling those would be awesome for recording in a noisy environment .,technology
you could even use them to monitor your audio while you are recording make sure it sound good .,technology
good point .,technology
and even if you are not podcasting that noise canceling it is a lifesaver when you need to focus .,technology
all before we wrap up the accessory we got ta mention applecare plus .,technology
yes the peace of mind purchase .,technology
applecare plus in it is an extended warranty .,technology

you never know when youll need it .,technology
exactly and accident happen especially with a device you use all the time an ipad .,technology
weve covered the ipad air itself and all these cool accessory .,technology
what stand out to you the most ?,technology
i think it is amazing how apple created a device that can be many thing to different people .,technology
i know what you mean .,technology
it is a note taking machine a creative canvas a productivity tool even a portable entertainment system .,technology
and the accessory they let you customize it even further build your own ipad air setup .,technology
now that weve seen whats possible let talk about the bigger picture .,technology
how technology the ipad air impact our life .,technology
yeah it is easy to get caught up in the spec and feature but technology it is about empowering u letting u do thing we couldnt do before .,technology
let explore that .,technology
how can the ipad air with it portability it versatility unlock new possibility for people ?,technology
for starter think about learning .,technology
we were talking about learning how the ipad air can open up all these new possibility .,technology
think about it .,technology
it can be an interactive textbook a portable research library even a language learning tool .,technology
and with the apple pencil note taking it becomes much more engaging .,technology
you mentioned wanting to learn a new language .,technology
i bet the ipad air would be perfect for that .,technology
all those language learning apps .,technology
and with the interactive nature of the ipad the handwriting recognition i think it could help .,technology
and it go beyond education ?,technology
think about creativity .,technology
the ipad air with that a14 chip the beautiful display it is a great tool for artist designer anyone who want to express themselves creatively .,technology
it is amazing how much technology ha become a part of the creative process .,technology
you use the apple pencil to sketch paint even compose music .,technology
on the ipad air .,technology
it is having a studio in your hand .,technology
and the app store it is got all these incredible creative apps .,technology
you can push the boundary of whats possible .,technology
and we can not forget about connecting with others video call sharing photo and video being part of online community .,technology
the ipad air make it easy .,technology
you mentioned watching movie with your family .,technology
imagine watching those on the ipad air display .,technology
with that dolby atmos sound itd be a whole new experience .,technology
yeah a portable home theater .,technology
but even beyond entertainment think about thing telehealth appointment virtual conference online fitness class .,technology
it is a window to the world .,technology
it let u connect with people and experience that we might not have been able to before .,technology
it make you think about how far technology ha come and how it is changing everything the way we live work learn .,technology
a we wrap up this deep dive i think the main thing to remember is the ipad air .,technology
it is more than a gadget .,technology
it is a tool that can help you do the thing you love explore new idea live a more connected life .,technology
it is been fun exploring the ipad air with you .,technology
and especially seeing how it connects with your own interest and goal .,technology

whats up guy and welcome back to the honest tattooer podcast .,art
my name is john messa i am with my cohost matt riano .,art
what up what up what up ?,art
our boi g money in the house .,art
thats good .,art
our guest today ha been in the tattoo industry for several decade and it is a very very known figure in the world of tattooing and especially probably known a the father of dark art in tattooing .,art
and i know ?,art
thats what i should hit it .,art
but welcome pal booth to the podcast man .,art
thanks man .,art
thanks for having me .,art
no thanks much for coming by .,art
for the people that do not know you let them know where you are from how long youve been tattooing and what tattoo do you do ?,art
i am paul booth .,art
i am based out of new york city although now i am in new jersey since covid and ive been tattooing thirty six year now a of next week .,art
wow thirty six year .,art
when i wa nineteen i wa a repo man and i stole car for a living and i painted mural on hot rod and shit that an airbrush artist .,art
and i got this chick pregnant at nineteen and had the kid and i wa freaking out about it because i wa nineteen .,art
i wasnt ready to be a dad but i wasnt going to run away either .,art
my friend suggested i get her name tattooed on me to cope with it .,art
and i thought yeah thats a commitment maybe itll help .,art
i got her name tattooed on me and i got to customize the design and everything .,art
it wa wow this is neat .,art
the whole process blew me away .,art
the pain the ritual .,art
this wa your first tattoo ?,art
picking a design off the wall and customizing it .,art
and i fell in love with the whole thing .,art
i did not even think about it a a career .,art
i needed to know how to do it .,art
it wa simple a that .,art
and i picked it up .,art
i started drawing my tattoo and then i started hanging around the shop .,art
i paid him it wa five grand at the time .,art
back when you used to pay to apprentice .,art
it wa back before everyone wa giving shit away for free .,art
but i took the apprenticeship and within three month i wa tattooing .,art
and shortly after that i wa getting paid to do it .,art
and two and a half year later i wa managing the shop .,art
then i left i went to california my old man wa sick and needed me to try and take care of him .,art
i moved to california and it wa the first time i had .,art
i should say the shop i learned in wa a very traditional street shop .,art
design on the wall everything .,art
and coffee can for ashtray nailed to the wall .,art
nicotine stain on the flash the plastic over the flash .,art
indoor smoking wa that .,art
one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight .,art
can we expand this ?,art
you are the first person to ever mention acetate stencil .,art
for people who are young and do not know what that is explain what that is .,art
the only thing we had back then wa you take a sheet of plastic and you would scratch with a nail lay it over the design and scratch it in with a nail on the plastic .,art
and then youd grease the arm vaseline or menin speedstick .,art
you would powder charcoal powder thats scratched in design on the plastic and press it onto the skin .,art
and thats what you had for a stencil .,art
youd be lost .,art
but it taught you to be precise and efficient and not sloppy because the slightest wrong move and you lose your stencil .,art
yeah you got to think about that .,art
that taught me a lot .,art
your hand placement .,art
start at the bottom if you are handed and work your way up to the top left .,art
controlled wiping too .,art
you do not want to wipe all that away. . exactly .,art
thats how i learned by wrapping a paper towel around my tattoo hand .,art
and i would blot with my pinky a i worked .,art
and thats where that came from .,art
how many year into tattooing were you when you could say your vision of what you wanted your tattooing to be ?,art
that wa when i left the shop two and a half year later .,art
i moved to california .,art
that wa when all of a sudden i wa in a shop that the guy wa a hack .,art
and it wa a shop and it wa the only one in town that would have me .,art
i went there and i had all the freedom in the world to do whatever i wanted .,art
it took some of my friend that i made while i wa living there .,art
about a year and a half i wa there .,art
and i did some free tattoo on them and brought them to a show in anaheim .,art
it is my first tattoo convention .,art
and i got a bunch of attention .,art
i wa surprised .,art
i wasnt expecting anything .,art
but it wa the first time i had the freedom to take my own drawing and do it my way .,art
i did not have a bos looking over me get him out of the chair we are making money money money that thing .,art
i wa able to explore my art more after that .,art
i do not regret those two and a half three year that i had doing tasmanian devil and heart and rose .,art
i did not even complain at the time because i knew i needed to do it to build a foundation .,art
the first one wa an attempt at what wa on the wall and the last one wa ripped with vein .,art
and fivezero of them later .,art
i am sure some tweety bird were sprinkled in there .,art
how did the industry first embrace your work ?,art
because i feel your work wa completely different than what anybody else wa doing .,art
ive always been on my own trip not for any other reason but it is my art .,art
i do not know how else to do it .,art
i do my own thing .,art
pittsburgh ninety one convention .,art
and i went there i came home from california and my job wa not waiting for me a promised .,art
here the boss son moved home and took my seat and that wa that .,art
i wa doing tattoo party biker party kitchen magician shit to pay the bill .,art
but i did not have a shop to work in and i wanted to be in a shop again .,art
i went i had my girlfriend at the time i did a big back piece on her and brought her to the pittsburgh show to try and find a job .,art
what wa the back piece ?,art
and but she wa hot and at the time a hot chick and a good big tattoo couldnt fail .,art
yeah you can not miss it .,art
and that still work today .,art
and not that that wa the plan but it worked out that way .,art
and i brought her to the convention and she wa a hit and i couldnt believe it .,art
i wasnt expecting anything .,art
honestly because i wa doing my own freehand work i did not expect anyone to it .,art
if someone like it cool thats enough for me .,art
and it wa she couldnt walk five foot without another photo .,art
i won all these award i did not even plan on entering her but everyone wa insisting and all these trophy and shit .,art
and next thing i know shes on the cover of the next magazine .,art
and it wa funny because they put me and her on the inside of the cover stand in there .,art
she wa on the cover .,art
and everyone knew the tattoo from that but did not know who the hell i wa it wa a weird beginning .,art
but i got an interview the magazine embraced me and the artist that i looked up to jack rudy and guy that that were at the show in pittsburgh were inviting me to come to their shop .,art
and i am this kid out of nowhere .,art
i did not i did not know anybody or nothing .,art
and i had several of these people inviting me to do guest spot .,art
and i jumped on it .,art
i took my van and i toured the country by van a few time and learning a i went i probably learned more after i left that shop than what i learned traditionally a an apprentice .,art
i relearned everything from old people i wa meeting .,art
it wa great .,art
and then it went from touring the country to getting invited overseas .,art
my first international show wa amsterdam with hanky panky .,art
i do not remember what year .,art
a year or two after ninety one ninety two ninety three .,art
it wa ninety three i think .,art
then from there i launched into getting invited to convention in other place in europe .,art
which expanded to the world .,art
and ive been traveling the world for thirty year .,art
it is crazy .,art
anna tattoo is brought to you by tattoo smart .,art
they offer digital design tool for the professional tattooer helping you save time and make your client happy .,art
make sure to check out some of their best seller the spitch shade set the needle set advanced 3d body part and one of my personal favorite the snake kit .,art

out of the place that youve been to which one would you say is the most memorable ?,art
there wa that girl in ... i love thailand .,art
i love the country of ireland .,art
the people are a little too conservative for me there but a lot of catholicism which i do not vibe with .,art
yeah these kid do not know my history .,art
no they do not .,art
i am pretty known for having an extreme dislike for the church .,art
not god in particular religion and general ... organized structural religion .,art
i have trouble with all that .,art
but ive always had trouble with authority figure anyway i have the same problem with cop a lot too .,art
it extends throughout the whole collection .,art
when did last right come to be ?,art
last right started i think legitimized in ninety four .,art
maybe it wa ninety three .,art
started out a dark image and then came up with ... you decided to shift from traveling to ... i am going to settle down .,art
yeah i did not have ... if you look in the old magazine back then the early 90 they would put the artist name under the photo and where they are from .,art
where i wa from wa always terrarville or hell .,art
i did not have a shop the magazine would make up crazy place .,art
no one knew where i wa from .,art
thats cooler though .,art
it is pretty cool .,art
dark catacombs. . much probably looking at me what am i doing ?,art
thats awesome .,art
then that came to i need to settle a place somewhere for myself .,art
yeah for me it blew up fast that all i wa ever doing wa trying to keep up with it .,art
one thing i start by looking for a job with a tattoo on my girlfriend .,art
even within a couple year i am doing interview on the news in the middle of europe somewhere .,art
and i am all of a sudden i have a red carpet rolled down in front of me everywhere i go .,art
not all of a sudden but it took a few year .,art
but it turned into that .,art
some people never get to experience that at all .,art
it wa pretty peculiar .,art
i try through the year ive always beaten myself up enough to try and remain somewhat humble but i could be a dick if i wanted to .,art
the shit ive experienced in this career is i can not even talk to people about it because it sound bragging because it is out of the ordinary shit .,art
because look you go to convention and half the time at least back in the day they were funded by organized crime one way or another .,art
and id be all over the world and id be sitting down having dinner with all kind of people that would be questionable .,art
and i got to know a lot of them .,art
but what wa the point of that ?,art
i should have mentioned to you before we started i have memory problem .,art
no but we were talking about after traveling you decide to settle down and you start working on last right a your place to be. . last right i wanted to bring i always liked bringing people together minded people .,art
and i wanted to open a shop that represented dark art what i obviously do and did .,art
but also the aesthetic is my passion .,art
my shop wa always an extension of me .,art
thats how it got decorated and the decor is always over the top and dark and creepy .,art
but it extended first from a tattoo shop where i wa partly trying to advance in my career and open a shop .,art
i had much attention on me it only made sense to do .,art
and then some year after that i ended up adding an art gallery to it .,art
and thats when i wa driven .,art
the reason i opened the art gallery wa because i am an only child and ive got the syndrome bad .,art
i am somebody that if you say no to me i have a hard time with it .,art
it is what do you mean no ?,art
anyway i wa always told that we werent real artist because we worked on skin .,art
we werent recognized in the art world or considered we were scoffed at .,art
piss me off .,art
because youve been painting and oiled for a long time and your art is definitive you which ha a voice which i think is valuable in all of the art world outside of even tattooing .,art
did you try to get into gallery in the new york air scene ?,art
that wa what spurred me on to open a gallery wa because id walk into a gallery wearing rotten sneaker .,art
i got a wad of ten grand in my pocket ready to buy art .,art
but in the art world if you are not wearing the shoe you do not get any attention .,art
general rule of thumb they do not take you .,art
you do not have money .,art
and it would piss me off .,art
i did not the way people were rude and snobby in the art world .,art
i said what motherfucker ?,art
it is going to be a family business and a family oriented idea .,art
and it is going to be from tattoo artist .,art
you can kiss my as ?,art
the rebellion and the angst and the contempt that i am fueled by generally is what drove me to open the art gallery .,art
i think a lot of awesome thing came from that moment in tattooing .,art
and when you were doing all these thing one i think ive always taken that idea of creating a shop thats an extension of you .,art
and i feel you did that going to last right wa a memorable experience for anybody when they first entered from the beginning till it wa awesome .,art
thank you .,art
that wa the whole inspiration .,art
ive never been there but ive talked to enough people who have been there who describe the place in such detail .,art
my vision of it is pretty fucking cool .,art
yeah it is always been about the experience .,art
ive always said that a tattoo should be more than an improv improvisational moment or hey i am getting pulsively going to get a tattoo and run in a shop .,art
yeah thats street shop and thats cool .,art
not wrong with that .,art
but i wanted to take it a step further where it is a special day you mark down on your calendar and say hey it is last writes day .,art
and i tried to make the shop a whole experience for them horror movie playing and metal music or whatever have you dark music .,art
and i had a home theater built into my shop people could watch the horror movie .,art
and it wa very theatrical .,art
it wa called the last writes tattoo theater for a reason .,art
i had planned on but had no success at the time .,art
i am sure someone will probably steal this now but whatever .,art
i wanted to have a troupe of actor in the shop .,art
and i wanted two old italian lady that would come out and cry next to you while you are getting tattooed .,art
or a guy with a violin strolling through the shop or a vincent price character reading poe out of a book .,art
shit that all day .,art
every saturday wa going to be theatrical day .,art
but i never got the crew together .,art
yeah that sound a lot of work .,art
it is it would be fun writing the skit .,art
your first dark image it wa in the east village ?,art
and you were there for how many year ?,art
that place i wa there nine year i believe .,art
it wa from ninety one ?,art
from ninety no no ninety one wa when i named last ninety four wa when i named last right but it wasnt a shop yet .,art
ninety eight i opened up in new york when it legalized. . and id been on 4th street from ninety eight to two thousand and six .,art
and then i moved for the gallery to open the art gallery .,art
i moved to a bigger spot by 33rd street and 10th .,art
and where it is now it is hudson yard .,art
now thats hudson yard .,art
but it wa fun because i wa in an industrial space .,art
i had the floor to myself at night at five oclock hit the building emptied .,art
i could probably .,art
there wa nobody in that area .,art
it wa a wild space .,art
if you did not know me youd never find me .,art
but that wa the mystique it wa what it wa about .,art
you open the elevator door open and there last right new york .,art
it is some amazing sculpture there .,art
we had a lot of giger stuff .,art
it wa it wa special i had a lot of fun with it .,art
id redesign it every five year revamp the whole place into something different because i get bored .,art
and i faced that six month ago in my art studio now my private studio .,art
i am now what ?,art
i added black light and crazy shit that .,art
tattoo armor is the best way to wrap your client .,art
matt been using it and it is awesome .,art
there no mess .,art
there no glue and it is super comfortable .,art
i hope you can try it for yourself and go on to tattoo armor and use the code on a tattoo for twenty percent off your order .,art
through your through last right you opened the door for many of the most famous tattooers let the guy that group were good and started working there and they took off .,art
i am that old garage band that every rock star once played in .,art
thats what it is .,art
but you always had an eye for a lot of talent .,art
and how did you how would you say it is a good way to hire people or to seek out for artist that are going to work at your shop ?,art
i had trouble because i had i had a high rent in new york .,art
fivezero square foot in midtown is no joke .,art
and it would take me a year year and a half to find a replacement when someone left because no one good enough .,art
i get thousand of portfolio but maybe a dozen are worth calling not to be a dick about it .,art
but yeah you have to filter it out .,art
you have to filter it out .,art
and but for me it is not about being a good tattooer .,art
it is having a good character too .,art
yeah thats important .,art
and it make it hard .,art
but because of the rent and everything i had to hire some people that i knew id regret hiring .,art
and thats when it got to the point where these particular artist sucked the life out of the shop for me .,art
there wa no more paint night .,art
there wa no more real camaraderie .,art
there wa headphone on for every tattoo and leaving my client out of the picture .,art
and that whole special experience wa gone .,art
you are getting lost .,art
and because the shop is an extension of me a the shop suffered i suffered .,art
and it i went into depression .,art
i wa tattooing minimally at the time .,art
and then covid came along and i am yeah fuck this .,art
tough moment .,art
i knew that .,art
yeah i would have kept going if it wasnt for covid .,art
all of a sudden i had this freedom and i got my art back .,art
i am tattooing and painting full time .,art
again and i am feeling my art more than i have in year .,art
and it is been the best move i ever made .,art
i am happy now and stress free .,art
i built a art studio in my basement .,art
i am i stroll downstairs and tattoo all day .,art
it is fucking great .,art
thats awesome .,art
and i am dealing with real people serious people .,art
it is not a walk in shop in my house .,art
it is i am dealing with people that are spending a lot of money and serious about their art it is not bad .,art
how doe that feel having all these people come to your house though ?,art
but i creepy. . i say he try to scare them more than they would .,art
they are more worried about me .,art
will you ever get out alive ?,art
we might not make it out of .,art
sometimes they bring their friend and their friend do not know me or anything about me and theyll come in and sit down and they are between a tiger paw and a taxidermied baby .,art
what a casket in front of them what am i doing here ?,art
and my humor is dark and sarcastic they do not know what to make of me .,art
man i feel you have a presence about you that when you enter a room everybodys yes enter the room .,art
what it is ?,art
my my defense mechanism because i do not do good with crowd .,art
i get a lot of social anxiety .,art
and my defense mechanism is to toughen up and make the hair on my back stand up .,art
i am always people say i am unapproachable but it is not that i am unapproachable .,art
it is that i am guarded .,art
because i do not do with people one on one .,art
a a tattooer i learned that .,art
i am a nervous little girl trying to do a seminar talking in front of everybody a fish in an aquarium .,art
ive had band drag me on stage and i freak out .,art
thats something i wanted to touch on .,art
youve tattooed some of the world page rock star .,art
which is wild .,art
how how did that even start happening ?,art
the magazine exposure .,art
i wa at a convention in california once again .,art
and we had a mutual friend .,art
and she he wanted to meet me .,art
she and i did not know he wa even there but he wanted to meet me and get tattooed .,art
she brought him to me and i freaked out because i wa a huge fan of sepultura .,art
yeah. . and we hit it off .,art
we became friend immediately .,art
i tattooed him invited me out to the house .,art
ive tattooed max and igor and the family at their house .,art
and they invited me out on the road with them to go on tour in ninety four .,art
and that wa my first tour .,art
and it wa pantera sepultura and biohazard .,art
and i wa out on that tour .,art
and that wa when i first met in selmo and a bunch of people we hit it off i ended up going to his place and tattooing him at his place .,art
and id make house call or what have you because i wa loving the whole experience .,art
yeah thats incredible .,art
for a fat guy from new jersey to be hanging out with his idol .,art
it is wow this is pretty cool .,art
and then we became friend .,art
it is not idol anymore .,art
they are when i listen to the music .,art
but but it is we have normal friendship and mutual respect .,art
thats incredible .,art
what do you think it is the major but misconception from people about you a an artist ?,art
i do not eat baby .,art
but ill say it here now .,art
i have yet to eat a baby .,art
not that i ever want but i have yet to eat one .,art
no i do not know misconception about me .,art
it is funny .,art
i have a lot of hater out there and the majority of them have never even fucking met me .,art
thats always the case ?,art
but i. i hear thing about me .,art
i feel the king of the rumor mill .,art
ive heard i am a gay heroin addict .,art
and i am yeah i am the world fattest heroin .,art
ive heard i eat baby .,art
ive heard i have massive orgy which is not necessarily .,art
i hear all this shit about me .,art
and it wa a point where i wa even starting my own rumor to see what would happen to them when they got back to me .,art
the telephone game how do you feel about the current state of mentorships and because we touched on it briefly before we started of the way that tattooing ha opened up .,art
i feel you started in a point of tattooing that it wa very it wa guarded .,art
i have positive and negative thought about it i and i am not going to sit on the fence .,art
ill tell you exactly what i think back in my day .,art
and i think even today still tattooing itself is an artisan craft .,art
it is stone cutter that built that do gravestone and monument and granite and stuff that .,art
yeah stone mason .,art
you do not learn that youve got to apprentice .,art
youve got to learn from the master and they pas the torch to you .,art
and tattooing wa that .,art
and then let see the first move that i recognized a the problem wa the big .,art
do you remember the dvd craze of how to video ?,art
the guy who started that came to me year later complaining about how all these new kid suck .,art
and i am maybe you shouldnt have taught him for one hundred buck .,art
what ? .,art
i wa i wanted to ask rus this last night because he made a dvd .,art
you are saying there is one guy behind all .,art
he a friend .,art
but but there is a person .,art
there one one person .,art
i remember the first guy that did it .,art
and then everyone jumped on board and everyone wa selling their how to video dvd .,art
i guess the question that i am asking is wa there .,art
wa there a publisher who wa behind all of these people ?,art
because it is not it wa all self public .,art
it wa all self .,art
thats what i wa .,art
it wa homemade dvd .,art
i feel they looked similar the cover looked similar it wa all produced by the same person .,art
not everyone follows along .,art
how many original bone are there ?,art
that that would redo it a new way .,art
it became a craze .,art
after i got the chance to sit down with matt and john on the honest tattoo or podcast the force of focus got amazing feedback when it come to the whole to heal the process and networking strategy and most of all creating your own personal brand and culture .,art
i want to give you the opportunity to take fifteen off by coming to join the force of focus arena .,art
now this is a community of high achieving tattoo artist who were all here for one reason to be around minded individual who all want to grow not only in our personal life but within our business .,art
we are going to walk with you side by side to build out every system you could ever imagine to not only ensure the fact you are on the path but how to be able to see your dream life and then achieve it .,art
now i have a laundry list of artist who have been able to achieve their dream .,art
and if you are ready to do the same click the link below and let get a conversation .,art
but there should be some degree of protection for the industry sake the art sake .,art
i do not think someone tattooing for three year should have three apprentice under them .,art
i do not think theyve been in long enough but i see that now all over the place .,art
it is more and more common .,art
and you learn for free .,art
thats fine too .,art
but i think you should pick and choose who you teach because i want the people i teach to be a credit to the industry a a teacher .,art
i want my student to surpass me .,art
otherwise why am i teaching ?,art
yeah i want to build a monster .,art
and thats how i approached every apprenticeship that i had .,art
and out of the five i had only half of one succeeded .,art
and but i am since i grasshopper shit it is not here how you poke hole in skin .,art
it is not a two month deal .,art
it is year .,art
i am probably overly critical and demanding .,art
and but ill break you and ill build you up again into a monster .,art
i know i will because thats my mission .,art
and then thats a costention of me .,art
if that guy look an idiot then i look an idiot too .,art
and it is hard .,art
and back in the day there wa a chain of who taught who .,art
i learned from ernie white .,art
he learned from i do not remember and on .,art
it wa a family tree in tattooing .,art
thats wiped out .,art
thats gone .,art
these new kid do not know what it wa .,art
when it wa smaller community and anything though a it get bigger and trendier it dilutes .,art
. . and then with the advent of certain tv show youve got riff raff coming into the industry because the artist on the show are tricked by the producer into being douchebags for their fifteen minute .,art
theyll do it to be on tv but they are destroying the industry because they are making u look a bunch of asshole .,art
i know thats harsh and extreme but and perhaps it is .,art
but what happens is you got these douchebags at home .,art
watching this and going hey wait a minute i am a douchebag .,art
i could be a tattoo artist too .,art
and here we are .,art
i want to be a rock star .,art
the floodgate opened and here we are .,art
it is inevitable .,art
but i believe and here the positive coming finally .,art
i believe we are headed for a new tattoo renaissance because whats happening now is all that riff raff that came in and poisoned the industry are getting bored because they are not the rock star .,art
they thought theyd be number one and number two .,art
they are getting starved out because business there a bit of a tattoo recession .,art
a lot of shop are slow .,art
and it is weeding out the wigglies correct weeding out the worm man because they are going to they do not have the attention span to stick with this .,art
it still take a special person to be a true tattooer .,art
i believe that .,art
and they are not it .,art
they are all going to fade away a the trend fade a it is .,art
and they are going to fade away .,art
and whats going to be left is the cream of the crop that stuck around because they are committed to it .,art
the bone the bone .,art
whats crazy is some of the people whove been in it for a long time they are starting to back out now also .,art
one of the problem i see some people do not realize i see it because i am out there on occasion anyway .,art
at the same time we had all this riff raff come into the industry .,art
all of the old timer left because they did not want to deal with the bullshit of the riff raff .,art
there no one left to pas the torch .,art
the new kid that are a credit to the industry are able to be one have no old timer around to tell them the story and teach them the shit i learned .,art
i wa over here .,art
i would eve drop on artist talking to each other and listen .,art
or i did not intervene and ask question it is not that there the old timer bailed .,art
i am one of the few that are left out there unless you are going to an old timer specific convention but the bigger convention how many old timer do it ?,art
not that none .,art
there almost no one there to smack these kid into shape .,art
no but i think also that some there there a lack of respect and value .,art
thats society in general .,art
society in general the way that they treat their elder ?,art
and i do not think thats thats in every culture but it is definitely not culture here in america .,art
it feel it is it is also a new thing .,art
the younger generation they lack respect for for geez of and across the board across the board of anything of anything .,art
what do ?,art
the young each the old how the nature is .,art
only reason we have a platform is because other people built this platform for u to get on .,art
. . thats it is crazy .,art
it is it is pretty normal for the youth to not see that .,art
it is this and new .,art
thats true .,art
i whats new is that the entitlement and the lack of work ethic in today youth ?,art
i think is whats new because i grew up .,art
i earned my first car .,art
i wasnt handed to me what ?,art
i worked for what i got and i am glad i did because i appreciated that much more .,art
all the tasmanian devil i tattooed i do not regret one of them .,art
yeah i wanted to do big back piece and shit but i wasnt ready for it .,art
and you said you do not feel comfortable taking on an apprentice because how you feel with your knowledge base and everything .,art
it is the same thing it is .,art
i think we are at a pivotal moment where there many new thing .,art
when you started tattooing tattoo machine .,art
now mainly when you go and everybodys using pen and dildo .,art
you got a red one .,art
yeah thats pretty good .,art
got two big black dildo .,art
the best .,art
thats got a black one with green led .,art
thats fancy .,art
mine ha a siren on .,art
and to come from a point and we are tattooing .,art
when you started i am sure you were doing acetate stetzels .,art
to now having a full ipad to be able to do a million thing .,art
and on top of that we have ai .,art
mid journey all of these tool .,art
how do you feel about the future of tattooing some of these tool and where we are going ?,art
my i explored my fan base first .,art
when nfts were all the rage i made a comment because i wa planning an nft thing because i got the picture where most people hated it because it wa new and they did not understand it .,art
when hated nfts and i made a post ?,art
and i said what do you guy think of nfts ?,art
and i lost two or three thousand follower for asking a question .,art
and everyone wa on me about it .,art
i am jesus christ i did not even say i wa doing anything ?,art
i held off on posting my plan .,art
a few month to see if thing would die down because whats the point of promoting it if half your fan base hate you ?,art
it is not going to go anywhere .,art
no. . i waited and then the bottom fell out of nfts and i managed to squeak by and not have started one .,art
but anyway it is not about nfts about ai .,art
and ai half my fan base love it and half my fan base hate it .,art
and it is an interesting place to stand because i personally love it .,art
i use it all the time but i use it a a tool .,art
it is not .,art
see people that do not understand how it work or dive into it enough think it is ripping off artist and cheating doing the art for you .,art
but for me what i learned with ai is i use mid journey a my main one for visuals .,art
but what i do is ive added it to my arsenal of tool to create my art .,art
i am using ai to build reference for a painting or even a tattoo .,art
and then i take that reference and i look at it and ill draw it on somebody or ill build the painting using the ai art or design i should say .,art
can not call it art .,art
but i would take these design and use them a reference .,art
and i use photoshop .,art
and thats not to enhance photo .,art
thats to to make art and it is another tool .,art
my attitude is that back when photography wa invented all the portrait artist were freaking out the everyone the artist are now with ai .,art
everyone wa afraid photography wa going to steal their job .,art
a of today photography and portrait art simultaneously both still exist and prosper .,art
there room for it .,art
there always room for it .,art
it is about adaptation .,art
they say the key to survival .,art
ai is not going anywhere .,art
either learn how to work with it or get left behind .,art
yes it is efficient .,art
it help me work out idea .,art
but you have to understand that it is not draw me a mermaid .,art
yeah i can i can tell it what camera to use .,art
i can tell what lighting to use .,art
i can tell how fin are on the mermaid .,art
and i can detail crazy and build variation of there much you can do .,art
it is sculpting with word and image .,art
you use the word and the comma and the description change everything .,art
yeah for sure .,art
if you look at it that a a tool and a a wordsmithing and image smithing tool i think it is pretty effective monetizing it .,art
i havent figured out other than merch .,art
yeah i doing a bunch of shirt design built on my ai .,art
but i am lucky because mid journey wa built on fourzero artist that they taught their style to to the ai .,art
i am lucky enough to be one of those fourzero .,art
when i go into mid journey ill type in in the style of paul booth and ill get something sometimes remotely but often paul booth ask image i can work with my own style .,art
how do that you are one of the artist that wa i saw the list ? .,art
without your permission .,art
yeah but id have given him permission anyway because it is not stealing your art .,art
ai is having a good and efficient art assistant .,art
it is hey assistant .,art
set me up with this .,art
the old master had apprentice doing their painting for them. . whats new ?,art
what happened wa they taught the art to the ai .,art
then they deleted the art and had the ai make derivative of that art .,art
if you type paul booth into mid journey you are going to get some that might resemble me or giger is a better example .,art
he more popular type giger into mid journey and youll get giger ask art influenced by giger influenced by giger not done by giger .,art
there this is not about stealing from the artist .,art
this is about being influenced by the artist .,art
i do not see anything wrong with that .,art
i emulated giger when i wa a kid with my airbrush .,art
he the one who inspired me to use an airbrush in the first place .,art
my attitude is it is that it is an emulation .,art
and i personally do not have a problem with it .,art
and i plan on keeping up with it because i to adapt to thing and in any business ai is stealing job .,art
yes but it is building new job ai oriented job .,art
it is about you keeping up with that learning to utilize ai in your field .,art
i am using it in tattooing and painting and everything else i am doing .,art
the book cover for my book i made an ai invented a girl that i am in love with but shes ai .,art
man sidebar did you hear about the kid that he created an ai girl that he fell in love with ?,art
yes he killed himself .,art
he called her daenerys gartagarian and he had her talk the game of throne voice .,art
thats what she wa typing in .,art
yeah the parent should know better .,art
they should have known better .,art
it is when juda priest wa blamed for that kid .,art
yeah it is not the ai .,art
no it is the parent .,art
the parent dude .,art
give me that computer .,art
i am going to throw it out the window .,art
it is funny .,art
you talk about the ai and helping with your your idea and your illustration .,art
i do not copy it. . i do not take the ai and and duplicate it. . i take the eye and use it a reference .,art
there is a difference .,art
it is still my art .,art
and thats referenced by ai .,art
and thats the the problem with a powerful tool that is that how many people that are going to keep it in that respect ?,art
thats the problem .,art
i agree with you there that they do not .,art
ive taken my flash fed it to the ai taught it to the ai .,art
and now i have ai based new version of my flash design .,art
i do not know to do it .,art
i do not have any plan .,art
but it is cool to see the variation on my own art .,art
it is refreshing to hear it is ive recently been doing exactly what you are doing pulling reference from mid journey or chapter pt and then using that to create a new image but highly referencing the ai .,art
and a small part of me is do not let anybody know that i am doing it .,art
but everybodys using google for copywritten image reference .,art
and thats worse than using ai because ai is not copyright. . it is under your direction .,art
yeah. . there this big problem in the i play this trading card game called magic the gathering .,art
and what i love about that game especially getting into it in the late ninety wa the artwork that came with it the fantasy work dungeon and dragon the dark art and all the very middle earthy type of art very fantasy based .,art
and what i loved about that company is that they would commission illustrator and good artist fantasy artist to paint the the the art that would eventually go on the card .,art
and now fast forward to today .,art
and what you have with ai is you can see the signature all over all the new printing of the new card and the new concept because they almost have this look of if if if you michael bade the crap out of it .,art
it is .,art
too many special effect and not enough soul of the artist on because there wa much creative help from the ai .,art
and sometimes it is you can visually tell you are man this artist did not he did great .,art
it is a balance between the ai and your spirit .,art
what ? .,art
but it can not be ai and it can be your mojo but or whatever you want to call it the soul of your art .,art
i think it is a balance between ai a reference and adding your soul to it .,art
yeah because thats essentially what it is you are designing something in ai and then you are reinterpreting it with your soul involved in that ai then becomes part of the journey but not the result .,art
it is a great tool .,art
what a piece of advice would you give a younger artist about maintaining in this in tattooing ?,art
we are full .,art
whatever you were doing .,art
no no there a art out there that blow me away .,art
there some amazing artist out there .,art
and i wish more of them showed their work healed .,art
but yes no le there is same .,art
there is a lot of talent out there .,art
unfortunately it is only guy u that know when it may look good but it is going to heal shit .,art
for age shit .,art
yeah absolutely .,art
we can spot it .,art
man i wa having a conversation with some guy from ireland at the convention over the weekend and we were talking about how .,art
he wa asking me if i wa entering anything into the contest and i wa i do not have anybody .,art
maybe ill enter the guy that i have tattooing today in one of the category is not tattoo of the day .,art
and i wa hopefully they let me do it since it is not a healed piece .,art
he wa what are you talking about ?,art
over in ireland and he maybe in other country overseas too he wa saying that .,art
healed tattoo are looked down upon at the convention a far a entering the contest .,art
and then i wa trying to but how .,art
anybody who could do decent art can make a good looking tattoo fresh .,art
but it is not necessarily always going to look that way after it is healed .,art
and he wa no you got to you got to do fresh tattoo because thats whats important .,art
that is crazy .,art
thats a bunch of bullshit .,art
you feel we are at a point where at a pivotal point to have a new renaissance tattoo .,art
yeah i think .,art
within the next few year what doe that look to you ?,art
relief le bullshit .,art
i am waiting for this trend .,art
dnes trendiness of tattooing to fade .,art
yeah a all trend do .,art
and i think it is starting to in the mainstream you get the poser and the bandwagon ear .,art
yeah it is all part of the cycle of thing .,art
and then next year left with only those that are credit .,art
i feel the true will weather the storm after .,art
yeah whether the storm itll be worth it .,art
itll be worth it because we love it .,art
and then everyone thats not everyone but a lot most of the people that are tattooing after this will be worth your time .,art
the the the quality of work is going to rise more exponentially i think .,art
maybe thats too much of a word to use at extreme but but maybe not exponentially but it is certainly going to continue to rise .,art
and it is going to be left for the people that .,art
should be here .,art
yes no more of this .,art
these shenanigan with bullshit tattoo and tattooing ha always had it trend .,art
even i wa a trend there all kind of trend and it is not a big trend .,art
but i am saying the stylistically biomechanicals a trend faded trend but still popular amongst people that biomechanical .,art
there always a home for everything .,art
thats legitimate .,art
but the bullshit ignorant style .,art
what the hell is that ?,art
it is scratch .,art
it is random scratcher .,art
it is a scratcher .,art
it is offensive to me .,art
i work hard at this and have for a very long time .,art
and for it prof what a joke it is become .,art
that that can be popular .,art
what do you think make a tattoo truly remarkable or beyond a tattoo and more smart ?,art
because i feel youve created that .,art
if you do a tattoo that is not going to look good in ten year it is not a tattoo .,art
it is not a good tattoo .,art
youve got to think about ten year down the road when you do a tattoo .,art
youve got to be thinking about how it is going to age .,art
because for me when i started the permanence of tattooing wa an attraction a big one .,art
and now people argue with me about it .,art
it is not important anymore .,art
i can not argue with you .,art
i guess this is what the new generation is .,art
yeah it is sad but because because we are trying to put essentially our mindset is that we are trying to put art on the body .,art
and this is more along the line of i do not know even borderline mutilation where it is i am going to cause a statement and put something horribly bad on .,art
yeah yeah a a statement for sure .,art
yeah statement .,art
you got these pop star with scribbled desk scribble all over the face .,art
yeah i want to look bad on purpose .,art
each to their own i am not here to judge if thats what you are into .,art
thats what you are into .,art
but i carved image into my desk too .,art
but it wasnt my face .,art
i want to know who is your favorite tattoo artist ?,art
philip lou ha been probably consistent .,art
may could we get him on the show ?,art
i know man .,art
getting him to come to the state would be that would be a challenge .,art
i know thats why we got to get on the trip .,art
we should put up .,art
we would fly to the swiss alp or french alp .,art
we put a montage of all the people mentioning his name .,art
come here and talk to u . that would be a challenge without being credible .,art
he probably up there one of my favorite tattoo artist a . absolutely .,art
he life it .,art
he breathes it .,art
there a lot more to him than a lot .,art
thats a cool tattoo .,art
he dedicated and no joke .,art
ive seen him lay out body suit in eight hour and he the fastest ive ever seen .,art
and i am fast but he blow me away .,art
people i say fast people are you shouldnt rush .,art
not rushing .,art
no it is fast .,art
it is effectively .,art
and i think it is important that you are at least somewhat efficient with a tattoo because your customer sit in there suffering .,art
and it is it would be nice if it did not take fourteen hour to do a portrait that big but each to their own yeah i do not rush at all .,art
i am not out to be the fastest .,art
i my style lends itself to speed .,art
it is built that way .,art
it is intended to be that way .,art
there texture i create that can only be done quickly .,art
thats the secret to my speed is the efficiency and the technique .,art
and a we come to a close i want to ask you one question .,art
whats one piece of advice that you would give your younger self and your tattoo career run away ?,art
what would you tell paul booth if you could go back in time at any point in time ?,art
trust no one .,art
stay true to your art man .,art
do not get caught up in the hype and all the bullshit around it .,art
if you become popular thats great .,art
congratulation but do not let it go to your head .,art
there nothing worse than an egomaniac especially in tattooing .,art
there many of them .,art
and i hate it more than i hate anything .,art
is these cocky prick that think they are god gift to tattooing .,art
and i think it is important for learning if nothing else to get better .,art
you need to humble yourself .,art
and i think the best advice for me is you stay true to your art and everything else will come .,art
the popularity the rock star bullshit all that stuff will come if you are good .,art
and and granted there a lot of good artist out there that nobody ever heard of .,art
but still you be the best you can be with your art without compromising and staying true to it than all the other thing that you are looking for .,art
and you are driven a goal .,art
focus on the journey not the reward .,art
that journey is probably the most the part that keep you going man especially in tattooing .,art
it is a journey man .,art
whats next in your journey after thirty year of tattooing ?,art
whats next in your journey ?,art
i got a screenplay for a horror film i am looking to do .,art
i came out with a book .,art
ive got my own coffee now my own ink .,art
what it is ?,art
i the first time in a long time all i have to think about is myself .,art
i do not have a bunch of artist to feed .,art
and i could focus on thing i want to do making some money outside of tattooing is always nice .,art
you get old you lose your hand in your eye and you can not tattoo anymore .,art
what do you got ?,art
ive spent year gradually building up thing outside of tattooing .,art
thats the bulk of it now .,art
ive always been an explorer .,art
if i get a crazy idea i get up in the middle of the night .,art
i give it a logo and i start a proposal and turn it into something my nature .,art
i have pile of these business idea and concept that some of them are million dollar idea .,art
but i am an artist before i am a businessman .,art
of course i can come up with the idea but facilitating them is a little more difficult for me .,art
thats always the hardest part the execution of my good thing .,art
it is hard to keep that balance .,art
when i had the shop business pushed in front of the art over demand and over the art had more demand to it that took my art away from me for a bit and because i had to focus on business .,art
and thats why i walked away from doing convention year ago producing them .,art
when i did tattoo the earth i quit .,art

hey everyone and welcome back for another deep dive .,art
today we are taking you behind the scene of something you probably love listening to podcasts .,art
but we are not talking about the content itself .,art
we are going deeper into the world of branding and cover art .,art
well be exploring how podcasts create their unique identity .,art
and why thats crucial in a world with get this over five million podcasts out there .,art
thats a lot of competition .,art
that blew my mind when i saw that stat in a recent article on suburl ag .,art
a website that cover tech and cyber trend .,art
it made me think about how my favorite podcasts stand out .,art
you are how do you cut through all that noise and make your podcast shine ?,art
thats exactly what well be uncovering today .,art
whether you are a podcast enthusiast or maybe thinking of starting your own this deep dive will give you a whole new perspective on what make a podcast truly captivating .,art
and it all start with understanding the power of branding .,art
it is more than a logo .,art
it is way more than a logo .,art
i feel people throw that word around a lot .,art
think of it this way. . every time you reach for your favorite coffee .,art
or choose a specific brand of sneaker .,art
whats driving that decision ?,art
i guess it is because i know what to expect .,art
i trust those brand .,art
and they feel familiar a part of my routine .,art
and it is the same with podcasts .,art
branding is about creating that same sense of familiarity and trust with listener .,art
you are building a personality for your show that attracts the audience and keep them coming back for more .,art
how do podcasts do that ?,art
what are the element that go into building a podcast brand ?,art
the article break it down into a few key component .,art
first you have the podcast name. . which seems obvious but is super important. . it need to be memorable relevant to the content .,art
and something people can easily search for .,art
it is would you rather listen to a podcast called ramblings about stuff ?,art
or something more specific and intriguing. . a good name spark curiosity and tell listener what they are in for .,art
i that .,art
then there the tone and voice of the podcast. . which is all about the vibe. . some podcasts are super serious the daily with it news anchor delivery while others are more casual and chatty armchair expert .,art
thats true .,art
it is choosing between a documentary and hanging out with friend ?,art
you have to decide what experience you are creating for your listener .,art
and then of course there the cover art. . this is your first impression .,art
and in the crowded world of podcasting it need to be eyecatching. . i have a confession to make. . i judge podcasts by their cover art. . i know .,art
i know maybe i shouldnt but a great cover draw me in .,art
research show that listener scroll through podcast apps incredibly quickly .,art
your cover art ha to make an impact in a split second .,art
thats crazy .,art
this is where a minimalist design can be surprisingly effective. ?,art
i would have thought youd want something super flashy to stand out .,art
it is counterintuitive. . but a clean uncluttered design with a strong focal point can cut through the visual clutter and grab attention .,art
it is about making it easy for listener to understand what your podcast is about at a glance .,art
it is le is more when it come to podcast cover art .,art
think of iconic brand apple or nike. . their logo are incredibly simple. . yet instantly recognizable .,art
the same principle applies to podcasting .,art
that make a lot of sense .,art
what else make for great cover art besides being minimalist ?,art
it need to be reflective of the podcast content. . a true crime podcast probably wouldnt have a bright and bubbly design ?,art
that would be creepy .,art
think about podcasts serial which us dark mysterious imagery to fit it true crime theme. . or armchair expert which ha a warm inviting aesthetic that reflects it casual conversation .,art
i am starting to see how every element tie back to creating a cohesive brand identity .,art
thats the key. . you want everything to work together seamlessly from the name to the cover art to the tone and voice. . and there are even more element that contribute to this the podcasts logo color scheme and even the music and sound effect .,art
yeah the intro music .,art
i love a good podcast intro that get you pumped up or set a specific mood .,art
it is a sonic signature for your podcast .,art
it add another layer of sensory branding that can connect with listeners. . but well dive deeper into those aspect a bit later. . for now let focus on cover art since it is often the first thing people see .,art
i am ready to learn how to create cover art that doesnt make me cringe. . you are ready to dive into the nitty gritty of creating captivating cover art .,art
what are the secret to making a cover that truly stand out ?,art
remember how we talked about the power of simplicity ? .,art
thats rule number one. . do not overthink it .,art
a clean uncluttered design is more likely to catch the eye than we remembered .,art
but how do you strike that balance between simple and boring ?,art
it is all about being intentional with your visual elements. . choose a striking image or graphic that represents your podcasts theme. . and let that be the focal point .,art
if you have a podcast about nature you might use a stunning photo of a forest or a mountain rain .,art
and remember those tiny thumbnail we talked about ?,art
make sure your main visual is still clear and impactful even at a small scale .,art
choose a strong visual .,art
this might seem obvious but it is worth repeating. . use high quality images. . a blurry pixelated cover scream amateur .,art
yeah. . it is if you do not care enough to have a decent cover why would i trust you to deliver quality content ?,art
think of your cover art a the storefront for your podcast .,art
a high resolution image show that you take pride in your work and respect your listener time. . weve got simplicity high quality visuals .,art
what about the text ?,art
the text a crucial. . make sure the podcasts name is easily readable. . choose a font thats clear and legible even at small sizes. . and consider the contrast between the text and the background .,art
you do not want your title getting lost in the design .,art
this reminds me of a podcast i tried listening to a while back .,art
the cover art wa super cool all dark and mysterious but i couldnt read the name of the show .,art
it wa frustrating .,art
thats a common pitfall .,art
we get caught up in making the cover visually appealing that we forget about basic readability .,art
noted legible font .,art
good contrast .,art
anything else about the text we should know ?,art
think about the tone you want to convey .,art
a playful font might be great for a comedy podcast .,art
but it wouldnt fit a true crime show .,art
the font choice can enhance your podcasts personality .,art
ooh thats a good point .,art
it is font have personality too ?,art
they can be bold elegant whimsical .,art
and do not go overboard with too many different fonts. . stick to two or three at most to keep it looking professional. . i am taking note .,art
weve got the visuals the text .,art
is there anything else we need to consider when designing cover art ?,art
this go back to what we discussed earlier about creating a cohesive brand identity. . your cover art should feel a natural extension of your podcasts overall vibe .,art
the color the imagery the font .,art
everything should work together harmoniously .,art
it is you wouldnt wear a tuxedo to a pool party ?,art
everything need to match the occasion .,art
and do not forget about the psychology of color .,art
whats that all about ?,art
did that certain color can evoke specific emotion and association ?,art
color have feeling .,art
not . . but our brain are wired to respond to color in certain way .,art
for example warm color red and orange can make people feel more energetic. . while cool color blue and green can feel more calming and trustworthy .,art
thats fascinating .,art
i guess the color you choose for your cover art can influence how people perceive your podcast .,art
they absolutely can .,art
it is worth taking some time to think about the color you are using and what message you want to send. . my mind is officially blown .,art
creating cover art is way more complex than i thought .,art
it is a whole art form in itself .,art
it is .,art
but do not worry .,art
you do not need to be a professional designer to create amazing cover art .,art
there are tool out there that make it super easy for anyone to get started .,art
the article mentioned that .,art
canva is fantastic. . it is incredibly userfriendly and packed with feature that help you create professionallooking design even if you have zero design experience .,art
ive heard good thing about canva .,art
what make it great for podcast cover art specifically ?,art
first of all they have ton of readymade template designed specifically for podcasts .,art
you do not have to start from scratch .,art
you could choose a template you and customize it with your own image text and color .,art
that sound much easier than staring at a blank canvas wondering what to do .,art
it is .,art
and they have a huge library of stock image and graphic you can use if you do not have your own .,art
plus you can play around with different font color shape and even add little icon that represent your podcasts theme. . i am sold .,art
canva sound a game changer .,art
but before i go create my masterpiece .,art
any final tip or trick you want to share ?,art
here a tip i learned the hard way. . design with those tiny thumbnail in mind. . when you are working on your cover art in canva zoop out every now and then and see how it look at a small scale .,art
thats a good point .,art
it might look amazing on your computer screen but it turn into a blurry mess on a phone .,art
think about this .,art
you only have a split second to grab someone attention a they are scrolling through their podcast app. . your cover art need to be clear concise and visually appealing even at a tiny size .,art
it is all about making a strong first impression .,art
and remember your cover art is one piece of the puzzle .,art
it is part of a larger branding strategy that includes your podcasts name tone and overall personality. . weve covered a lot of ground here .,art
we have .,art
from the importance of simplicity to the psychology of color it is clear that creating effective podcast cover art is a blend of art and science .,art
it is .,art
and a listening habit continue to evolve we can expect to see even more creative and innovative approach to podcast branding .,art
thats exciting .,art
it make you wonder what might the future of podcast visuals hold ?,art
could we see cover art become interactive or even animated ?,art
thats a fascinating thought. . imagine scrolling through your podcast app and seeing cover art that come to life .,art
it could be a game changer for capturing attention and engaging listeners. . i am officially geeking out about the future of podcasting .,art
but before we get too carried away let bring it back to the present .,art
weve talked a lot about the visual element of branding .,art
but what about the audio side ?,art
did not the article mention music and sound effect ?,art
and those element play a crucial role in shaping a podcasts identity. . think about your favorite podcasts for a moment .,art
do they have a catchy intro song ?,art
or maybe a signature sound effect ?,art
now that you mentioned it a lot of my favorite podcasts do have those little audio touch that make them unique .,art
it is adding seasoning to a dish. . the music and sound effect can enhance the mood create a sense of anticipation and even trigger emotional response in listener .,art
i never thought about it that way but it make total sense .,art
if you have a podcast about true crime you might use eerie music to set a suspenseful tone .,art
or a comedy podcast might use upbeat music and silly sound effect to create a lighthearted atmosphere .,art
it is all about creating a sonic landscape that complement the content and enhances the listening experience .,art
how do podcasters go about choosing the music and sound effect ?,art
is it a gut feeling or is there more to it ?,art
there definitely a strategy involved. . some podcasters hire professional composer to create original music for their shows. . while others use royaltyfree music library to find track that fit their vibe .,art
i bet that can get expensive though hiring a composer .,art
it can be an investment .,art
but it allows you to create a truly unique sonic identity for your podcast .,art
and for those who are on a tighter budget there are plenty of affordable option out there. . the key is to choose music and sound effect that are high quality and align with your podcast brand .,art
it sound there a lot to consider when it come to the audio side of podcast branding .,art
there is .,art
but with the visual element it is all about creating a cohesive and memorable experience for your listener .,art
weve covered a lot of ground in this deep dive .,art
weve explored the power of branding the key element that go into creating a podcasts identity and even glimpsed into the future of podcast visuals .,art
what stand out to you the most from all of this ?,art
what fascinates me is how podcasting ha evolved from a niche medium to this incredibly diverse and dynamic landscape .,art
and a technology continues to advance i think well see even more innovation in the way podcasts are created and consumed .,art
i am with you on that .,art
it is exciting to think about what the future hold for podcasting .,art
but for now i want to bring it back to our listener .,art
if you are a podcast enthusiast i encourage you to take a closer look at your favorite show with a fresh perspective .,art
pay attention to the branding choice theyve made .,art
how doe the name the cover art the music and the tone all work together to create a unique and memorable experience ?,art
you might be surprised by how much thought and intentionality go into crafting a successful podcast brand .,art
and for those of you who are dreaming of starting your own podcast remember that a strong brand identity can be your secret weapon for standing out in that sea of five million show .,art
the world need your story your insight and your perspective .,art
go forth and create something amazing .,art
thats a perfect note to end on .,art

if i am going to make a painting i want it to feel a painting .,art
what doe painting do that nothing else can do ?,art
and it would be cobbling together sloppy abstract shape that if you took them apart wouldnt make any sense .,art
but you put them all together you soften an edge here you harden an edge here .,art
you get the color harmony .,art
it all of a sudden pop into this representation of a memory .,art

i wanted to congratulate you on this not that i am a condenctor of the of the of the art but this wa an excellent book .,art
thank you sir .,art
i wanted to get started .,art
ive also a i mentioned to you id also seen your painting in the gallery in moscow .,art
ive been looking forward to having this conversation because the visual art are not one of my skill set .,art
i do enjoy travel photography but painting and drawing and thing this are beyond me .,art
ive been looking forward to talking with you about your art and the process of getting to where youve been and also the book that youve created .,art
maybe we can start at the beginning .,art
what wa the beginning of that ?,art
what did that look for you ?,art
and i guess also how wa it nurtured to the point where you are hey i can maybe do something with this ?,art
i do not remember a time when i wasnt drawing .,art
i think every kid begin their life drawing .,art
i wa one of those that did not stop .,art
my friend classmate they petered out in early grade school .,art
and i wa the kid that wanted to stay in from recess and draw skateboarder snowboarder monster anything that peaked my interest at the time .,art
id always been doing it .,art
i loved calvin and hobbes tintin asterix .,art
i loved old disney animation handdrawn animation .,art
my mom did a good job of hanging some nice print on our wall growing up .,art
we had old master john singer sargent soroya winslow homer .,art
we had some pretty good print on the wall .,art
she had great taste .,art
i wa always surrounded by story and picture .,art
and then later in high school wa when i realized that i wa probably not going to be able to do anything else with my life .,art
there wa only one option .,art
nothing else interested me .,art
i thought maybe a marine biologist could be interesting but i thought manatee were cool .,art
and that wa a phase .,art
i had a manatee phase .,art
and they still have them .,art
maybe ill do that someday .,art
i graduated from logo and then went to the university of idaho which is the local university here in moscow and jumped in at their fine art program .,art
the program wa in between professor at the time .,art
they werent dedicated drawing or painting professor there while i wa attending .,art
i got a lot of instruction from the internet book and wa given a lot of free time to pursue it on my own .,art
and then yeah i think it wa my junior year .,art
i started working with canon press in college .,art
i think the first project we did together wa the riot and the dance biology textbook that dr. gordon wilson wrote .,art
it ha since ballooned into a whole nature doc series that you can find on canon plus .,art
viddangel i think ha it a . but i am not sure .,art
i started a a biology textbook .,art
i wa illustrating beatles thing whose name i can not remember .,art
and then from there i started working with nate wilson pretty early on a . we started doing i started helping him out with some pitch deck for some of his novel for film pitch .,art
and then we started working on hello ninja the board book .,art
and that wa two thousand and thirteen i think we started that came out in two thousand and fourteen .,art
and then that wa that wa how my career started wa biology textbook hello ninja .,art
and then canon press is they produce curriculum book all kind of different book trade book a few novel thing that .,art
i wa i wa immediately stretched into all kind of different artistic category off the bat which i am very grateful for .,art
yeah thats an introduction .,art
i am glad i am glad you said that because i am looking at the crispin rainy day art style .,art
it is got a little bit of the a at howells moving castle miyazaki feeling to it at least in the eye .,art
but a i looked at this book and looked at the looked at the drawing looked at the art and then i compared it with what i saw at the gallery .,art
there wa one particular painting of yours it had a had a magenta sky you probably know the one that i am thinking of looking out over an idyllic landscape and something about that sunset caught me .,art
but there there couldnt be a bigger difference at least to me there couldnt be a bigger difference between the what you painted in that painting and the art style of this textbook .,art
and i think it make sense that you would have done much different stuff .,art
and thats how you would be able to cross the line many different many different line in visual art to different style .,art
yeah thats interesting to hear you say that because i do not think about it too much .,art
i think in term of genre i am trying to make a nice painting that will be itll it is a composition that can stand on it own .,art
there no character in it .,art
it is a landscape painting .,art
but i am using a lot of the same muscle to illustrate a page of a picture book .,art
there and that started out a a curiosity for any any image making i wa interested in .,art
whether it wa cartoon i said animation printmaking board game art video game art biology textbook i anything that wa interesting to me i chased it which ha been helpful .,art
and one one reason i did that because i needed money .,art
but what that gave me wa an ability to jump between medium or genre without too much trouble .,art
when you when you started out a a kid i guess you were probably drawing in school notebook with a pen or a pencil or something that or did you jump into watercolor or acrylic ?,art
how did how did that take shape ?,art
and also a i look at crispin rainy day what wa this done in ?,art
wa this wa this digital ?,art
wa this illustrator or wa it hand drawn ?,art
it wa a combination .,art
but i made an effort to make them look a traditional a possible .,art
the line work is all traditional .,art
it is it is dip pen and dip pen and ink on bristol board .,art
i penciled and inked traditionally and then colored it digitally .,art
i wa going to color it traditionally but we were running out of time and i had to get it done .,art
and then what wa the other part of that question ?,art
wa there wa there a medium that wa interesting to you off the bat ?,art
or wa it into whatever you could get into your hand ?,art
yeah no off the bat .,art
there wa no medium that caught my interest .,art
it wa pencil and paper .,art
and then color wa a way to enhance what i wa already drawing .,art
colored pencil when i wa younger .,art
and then logo school doe a great job of giving art instruction to it student that i found out is rare and not something thats done in most school across the country .,art
when i have friend i told them i spent my i had instructor during elementary school that taught me they would draw a sunflower and then i would have to copy the sunflower .,art
all my art friend were blown away because they never had any instruction that from their public school .,art
i am grateful to logo for giving me art lesson that i definitely did not appreciate at the time .,art
i thought they were boring but it wa a good foundation for what i would eventually do .,art
it wa all pencil pen and ink .,art
and then i loved animation but that wa hand drawn animation wa an art form that wa on the way out when i wa getting old enough to enter the workforce .,art
i had set that aside and went and pursued oil painting .,art
that wa what i chased in college .,art
it wa a good way to combine my interest my interest for being outside taking hike going on trip with image making .,art
i wa able to go outside and paint and respond to the landscape and the light directly which wa something that i found compelling .,art
it wa pencil paper and then oil paint .,art
and those have been my two go to medium for a while now .,art
i landscape photography and travel photography .,art
can you talk a little bit about the process of painting a landscape in the landscape ?,art
this is one of maybe at some point in my life i will pursue that .,art
maybe i will chase that because thats something that i think speaks to me .,art
maybe you could talk a little bit about how you got into that what the process ha been learning that what your process is for doing a painting that a . that would bless me quite a bit .,art
yeah it is thrilling .,art
i remember the first time i went out i had bought these water soluble oil paint which you think about it make no sense at all because water and oil do not mix .,art
but somehow they were able to take these paint introduce a molecule or remove a molecule that ruined it and became water soluble .,art
and i went out with some friend .,art
it wa freezing cold .,art
i grabbed water from a creek to mix my paint .,art
and i made a atrocious little painting of some birch tree .,art
but it wa thrilling because it felt hunting .,art
i wa out there in the wild ready to kill something .,art
it wa challenging .,art
you have three hundred and sixty degree of view around your easel .,art
you have temperature you have sound you have wind all these different factor that are bombarding your sens .,art
and if it is done they can experience what you did almost a effectively which i think is fascinating .,art
i enjoy the process of hunting .,art
it is challenging .,art
it is clear whether you succeed or fail .,art
there not a lot of wishywashy gray area .,art
you either make a nice painting or you do not .,art
and then i enjoy being able to bottle that sensation or experience and frame it nicely give it to somebody else that they can then enjoy it a . when you take the canvas out there into the wild do you finish it all at once ?,art
is that the goal ?,art
ive got x amount of time to finish it before the sun set or a storm roll in or can you bring it back and try again or add to it ?,art
yeah both .,art
it is nice to finish on the spotter a they are called but that rarely happens .,art
usually you only have an hour or two before the light change .,art
your subject matter completely different .,art
you have to be quick .,art
and then once youve got that impression down you can take it back to the studio .,art
and ill generally most of my plein air this is what it is called when you paint plein air .,art
it is the open air .,art
when you are painting plein air i generally make study and then bring it back to the studio for larger piece or ill fix it up in the studio .,art
it is challenging to get something finished out there in the field .,art
that make sense because i wa imagining you only have x amount of time with the light being the way it is and the care and the thought and the attention the detail that go into a beautiful piece .,art
maybe itll come together in the course of a couple hour but it did not seem likely to me that lightning would strike that often .,art
yeah no it doesnt .,art
and there something charming about a sketch .,art
i do an unfinished sketch .,art
there a lot of energy .,art
if it is done if it is not entirely finished then there more for the viewer imagination to do when it is looking at that particular painting .,art
they can finish it on their end and then it becomes a little more sticky in their own mind i think .,art
yes a pencil sketch or a color sketch .,art
i can a quick little color scribble either way .,art
i am glad we are talking about this because i am thinking about the art exhibit that wa in moscow during grace agenda .,art
and one of the thing i noticed again this is coming from someone who doesnt have a fine art background .,art
i do not have enough language .,art
i know what i see .,art
i know what i and i can look critically at thing a opposed to thats cool and walk away .,art
i noticed that there wa a difference between some of the painting you had done which i guess i would call them more impressionistic and some of the more hyper realistic hyper detailed approach which had a different appeal .,art
i wonder if you can talk through the difference between those .,art
because i imagine it is a six of one half dozen another of the other an artist approach someone personal taste .,art
but maybe you can talk about the selection of style in that regard .,art
yeah personal taste ha a lot to do with it .,art
but ive and ive been through a lot of different style on my fine art journey .,art
and but ive recently landed in i guess what you call more of an impressionistic camp .,art
because when i am painting what interest me is the soul of a place or the overall impression of a landscape .,art
it is i want my goal to frame a window that is a an entrance into another world .,art
i am not looking i am not that interested in detail .,art
i am not interested in subject matter a much a the light .,art
the subject matter obviously matter .,art
but i am looking for that broad impression color harmony something that feel more the place than look a representational photograph of the place .,art
the strength of an impressionist painting if it is done is what we talked about earlier where you have something that is not entirely finished .,art
and when somebody look at it and it is there a brushstroke every other inch or something but then you step back and it all coheres into this unified piece of art .,art
that is the viewer mind finishing the painting with the artist .,art
and instead of me giving the viewer everything here everything down to the little hair that doesnt it is not a much of a poetic take on the landscape .,art
it is more a onetoone representation which can be impressive but it doesnt scratch the itch that i am trying to scratch which is a broad impression of a place that is delivered straight to your soul .,art
i am trying to bypass all the information tree grass cloud and give you the impression of what it felt to be there which is i think that style simpler design broader brushstrokes color harmony that are not exactly the same a what youd see in nature .,art
it doe a better job of feeling a place than a photograph would .,art
yeah i am trying to get the most out of painting when i do it .,art
and that impressionistic style i think is it lends itself to that more poetic take on the landscape .,art
when you say you are trying to get the most out of it what exactly do you mean by that ?,art
the most evocative feeling the viewer feel the most engrossed in it or you have effectively communicated what it felt to be there maybe all of the above ?,art
yes but making the most of the medium .,art
if i am going to make a painting i want it to feel a painting .,art
what doe painting do that nothing else can do ?,art
and it would be cobbling together sloppy abstract shape that if you took them apart wouldnt make any sense .,art
but you put them all together you soften an edge here you harden an edge here you get the color harmony .,art
it all of a sudden pop into this representation of a memory .,art
thats what painting doe that nothing else can do .,art
if with crispin rainy day i needed something a little more specific something that lended itself to gesture and expression and characterization .,art
thats i am going to grab the pen that i could get detailed expression out of the character .,art
i couldnt get you could i could have painted the whole thing but it would have taken forever .,art
and the expression wouldnt be a iconic .,art
by making them by turning these character into line you are boiling them down to their simplest form that it can be delivered quickly and effectively almost i do not know emojis .,art
thats yeah .,art
when i am painting i do not want to be making comic .,art
i do not want to be making a photograph .,art
i want to be making a painting feel a much a painting a possible that it can be what it is .,art
a you say that ive got the book ive got crispin rainy day here .,art
i want to hold something up to the camera for those who are watching .,art
i guess i guess you use the word iconic .,art
and this is the i do not know spoiler i guess but where he find the lightning sword i guess ive never this language is great because it is helping me interpret linguistically thing ive only seen visually .,art
when you say iconic obviously this image of crispin with a sword i look at this and i immediately know whats happening .,art
there not a whole lot of room for ambiguity .,art
it is there it is clear the line are sharp the action is communicated versus if you were to try and do this in a painting there would be a lot more interpretive work on the viewer and what am i looking at ?,art
what is the meaning of being crispin ?,art
it move le i suppose. . and it depends if i had painted it photo realistically or if i had painted it with a high degree of detail it could have done something similar .,art
but the goal here in that image and every image in this book is the goal is to deliver the story effectively .,art
and tying it all down by mean of black and white line work is what i thought wa an effective way to do that .,art
maybe we can talk a little bit about how that came together .,art
this i think this make a little bit more sense how something this would happen maybe beginning with a story outline maybe in the form of text and then breaking it into a storyboard form and settling on that .,art
but maybe you can walk people through what doe it take to produce a childrens book ?,art
because i can look at this and i can say this is deceptively simple .,art
it is a five ten fifteen minute experience .,art
you are meant to be read probably multiple time .,art
but it is not going to take three hour to go through the book .,art
and thats only possible because of probably many hour on the front end to make that reading process simple .,art
yeah i wanted to make the highest quality peanut butter and jelly sandwich that i could .,art
i know it is going to take second to consume or minute .,art
but i know from personal experience the book that i loved growing up those little those few minute where your parent are reading to you or you are reading by yourself can have outsized impact down impact down the line .,art
yeah with this book in particular i started with an image of a boy jumping through a puddle .,art
that wa what i wanted .,art
i did not have any idea what wa in the puddle .,art
i did not there wasnt rose the sibling the little sister wa not around at that point .,art
i liked the idea of a backyard adventure .,art
a puddle is something that everybody can relate to .,art
weve probably all jumped in one .,art
there it is .,art
i thought thats a great little entrance to a world that anyone can access in their backyard .,art
i started there .,art
and then also and then the next thing that came wa the color palette .,art
i had this very specific idea in mind for this pop of yellow the yellow rain jacket against gray and green and blue of a a rainy day .,art
i had the color palette .,art
i had the boy jumping through a puddle .,art
and then from there it wa i wa bouncing between image and text .,art
i would sketch some idea and then write some word that would maybe that would could go with those image .,art
and it wa a lot of trial and error .,art
i would take one direction until i wa bored or confused .,art
and then i would back up to where i wa still interested and then take that and run with it .,art
and that wa the process .,art
anytime i got bored i scrapped it went back to where i still liked it and then kept running from there .,art
the story took shape once .,art
i think once i decided that he wa going to jump through the puddle and fall into an ocean and meet up with a crew of his own his own crew of pirate frog that made me happy .,art
i ran the fact .,art
yeah it wa there nothing wrong with that .,art
yeah i remember the feeling very vividly of him the wish fulfillment for a kid of having your own crew of pirate frog waiting to do your bidding seemed it wa a worthwhile endeavor .,art
and then because there needed to be a story and not a boy and his pirate frog doing whatever they wanted i introduced the rose his sister .,art
and then the story became more about it became about their relationship .,art
how doe a brother how do a brother and a sister work together in this world thats fantastical and a whole lot of fun and very rainy ?,art
the story wa your original creation ?,art
thats beautiful .,art
that i did not expect .,art
and you struck that balance beautifully i thought .,art
thank you .,art
yeah i am glad to hear that you are picking up on that because that wa what i set out to do .,art
once the sister came along it wa when i got excited because i knew that it could be done it is been done before .,art
how do you have a female character who strong in a uniquely feminine way ?,art
how do you have a boy character who strong in a uniquely masculine way such that they do work together and it elevates both of them in their particular station ?,art
it is too easy to take them out .,art
and i wanted to figure out a way to have both of those thing in harmony in one story .,art
what is it ?,art
this book is for five to tenyearolds .,art
thats what the rough age range .,art
yeah i wrote it for my girl and they are age six to two .,art
i have a sixyearold a fouryearold a twoyearold and a twoyearold .,art
but yeah this is probably bad to admit but age never factored into what i wa thinking along the way .,art
i wa sixyearold in general .,art
thats something that the parent parent needed to it a because they are the one reading it to the kid .,art
a you were writing the story what resource did you turn to to try and find how to strike that balance between the sibling where the little girl could have a very valuable role in the story without stepping on the boy role in the story and vice versa ?,art
honestly it wa a lot of miyazaki .,art
he one of the few creator that get feminine strength i think .,art
it wa important that rose in this story not have a character arc .,art
all the angst and frustration is on crispin side .,art
he the one that is desperate to find this lightning blade and loses it at his little sister because he frustrated .,art
rose on the other hand she say what she want on the first page and by the end of the book she get exactly what she want .,art
she never loses her cool .,art
she never get in the way of the mission .,art
in fact shes vital to the mission .,art
miyazaki doe that in most of his story .,art
his female character are great .,art
there a few that are not great but in general that wa the flavor that i wanted to highlight in this story .,art
thank you for pointing that out because there wa something about the two character that i couldnt put my finger on but you nailed it .,art
yes crispin ha the angst he ha the arc he ha the journey in his particular way .,art
then you have rose and shes a consistent force throughout .,art
i guess i picked up on that but i couldnt quite ... there wa a relief in encountering her character not in the completion of the story but also the role that she play .,art
there a lot going on in this story .,art
yeah there a lot .,art
rose part of the critique i got early on when i wa showing draft of this around wa that she wa not interesting a a character because she had no character arc .,art
but that only told me that i wa on the track because not every character need to have an arc to be compelling .,art
rose is somebody who know who she is she know what she want and because shes unflustered by the chaos around her everything conforms to her vision .,art
she compels this rowdy crew of pirate frog by not reacting to them .,art
i think thats something that is incredibly important for especially younger girl to learn is reacting is never helpful .,art
by reacting you are putting that other person in charge .,art
if you stay calm keep your emotion in check you can control any situation that youve been given .,art
thats wonderful .,art
that i did pick up on in a couple of the scene that she wa very nonreactive in environment where i think the opposite is portrayed in culture where girl are encouraged to be reactive .,art
there one particular scene i am thinking of you probably know the one where shes confronted with a big challenge very suddenly did not go the way that she wanted to .,art
her response is here we go again .,art
in a very grounded way .,art
glad to hear you say that .,art
i thought too .,art
thats the part a i wa working the way through the story .,art
how is it going to balance this without it seeming demeaning ?,art
i know thats of course what everyone in moscow get accused of being not what they are .,art
i think pastor doug did the theobros essay a couple day ago and he wa talking about that .,art
you managed to strike that balance very of her being in a i guess we call it the domestic role but it not but it being an enhancement of her character in the story in general .,art
yeah yeah it is a big dumb boring lie that the domestic role is uninteresting and unfulfilling .,art
i think it is yeah one of feminism biggest crime is that it produce incredibly boring character boring people .,art
it is uncompelling .,art
i made sure yeah i wanted rose to offend all the wrong people .,art
shes at what point the pirate yell at the dragon to give u back our maid .,art
it is i leaned into the stereotype a much a i could because in this day and age in any day and age the stereotype they ring true for a reason .,art
yeah and also i have three little girl .,art
ive noticed that they tend to be feminine .,art
they are not they are not out there playing with truck and making up turning everything into a gun .,art
they everything they touch turn into a nest or a baby or some cooking utensil .,art
and nobody taught them that .,art
thats who they are .,art
and it is glorious .,art
why would i want to make that ?,art
why would i want to turn them into something that they are not ?,art
yeah i wanted rose to be strong compelling and maintain while maintaining her femininity .,art
and crispin got to be a little he very obviously a little boy .,art
it is he not a he not a man doing little boy thing .,art
he a little boy with little boy emotion on this big quest .,art
and i got the balance of the character .,art
and thats the thats the the only two character of the book are crispin and rose .,art
and you you balanced it .,art
and that that wa the thing that i think struck me .,art
again this is a little kid book which is that way that there much to unpack in a little kid book feel completely appropriate at the same time .,art
but you you managed to also crispin feel authentically a little boy .,art
he a little boy on an adventure with little boy emotion .,art
and and he brings his sister along the most reluctantly but she play a role in the story .,art
it is a there something i do not know i do not feel ashamed to say that it is a very powerful story that you crafted and along with the visuals a . thank you .,art
yeah i appreciate it .,art
i had a copy of the first hello ninja book which i won in an nsa raffle .,art
that but i can not find it .,art
i moved recently .,art
maybe it is in a box or maybe i donated it and i have a lot of little kid running around .,art
i am not what am i going to read this to ?,art
maybe you could talk a little bit about that project a . yeah .,art
that wa that wa the first thing that nate and i worked on together .,art
that wa i think i wa still a senior in college when i jumped onto that .,art
and he he wa curious about the board book market .,art
he wanted to try something .,art
he wrote i think he wrote three one one wa hello ninja one wa blah blah black sheep .,art
and then maybe the third one never got written but there wa another third one with zebra i believe .,art
but yeah my goal with ninja wa i wanted to make a board book that did not look a lot of the board book that i had seen .,art
i wanted something that wa colorful had depth wa fully painted .,art
it wa all digitally done .,art
it wasnt traditional paint but i wa a art student at the time .,art
i wa trying to paint thing that i wa practicing what i had been seeing .,art
i wanted different lighting situation different color palette .,art
and that wa that wa it .,art
that wa a far a i wa thinking with that book .,art
and then it went out there it made it way into the starbucks pick of the week which wa one of nates other book .,art
a sample of it wa going to be out there .,art
somehow that failed through .,art
that went .,art
from there it made it way into target .,art
and at that point i think nate and i were both thinking this is it couldnt go any further than this .,art
we had moved on creatively .,art
at least i had .,art
but then nates agent in la picked it up and decided to run with it .,art
and she shopped it around to a bunch of different studio .,art
and it ended up at netflix against all odds .,art
and i think two thousand and eighteen wa when we started working on the show with a studio up in vancouver called atomic cartoon .,art
and nate wa a producer and a writer .,art
i wa a design consultant and a designer a . we both had some creative control throughout the whole process .,art
what wa that process watching that experiment reach the height of culture in some way ?,art
it wa fantastic .,art
i learned a lot along the way .,art
and probably more looking back is where all the lesson came from .,art
but very grateful for it .,art
i assumed that anything i touched from that point on would be swept up into the machine and make million of dollar and be a huge hit .,art
thats what i assumed .,art
it hasnt worked out exactly that .,art
but lot of lesson were learned .,art
it wa a great process .,art
working with netflix wa pretty great .,art
working with atomic cartoon wa fantastic .,art
they were all talented and very professional people .,art
overall it wa a fun experience .,art
yes ha yet to be replicated but we are working on it .,art
what is the hello ninja series about ?,art
whats the overall vision ?,art
what were you guy trying to achieve with it originally ?,art
and then how did that take shape a it blew up ?,art
yeah nate could probably tell you more about the original vision .,art
i know it wa the original vision for me wa make it a fun a possible .,art
he handed me the manuscript and i thought how can i squeeze a many fun thing to paint a possible into this little short boardbook ?,art
that wa my goal .,art
make it full of light .,art
and that vision make it fun wa maintained throughout the whole process .,art
but once it wa turned into a show we were very consciously trying to make a show that wa genuinely healthy for kid imagination .,art
the goal wa not to provide a little escape from reality .,art
we wanted something that would encourage kid on their own journey to become better character themselves .,art
we wanted to enforce play pattern behavior imaginative adventuring that would be imitated by the viewer in a way that wa constructive healthy normal .,art
because we knew all the competition wa doing the same but pointing kid in the wrong direction for the most part .,art
it became one of netflixs most expensive snack that they ever made for kid at least .,art
that wa expensive .,art
they it wa a year of production .,art
lot of money and time and manpower wa made wa put into this show that it is four season each episode is maybe ten minute long .,art
we wanted to leave the audience better than we found them .,art
there were a few battle we had about when there were some feminist tendency that we are trying to creep in or this or that the other thing .,art
but overall it wa in a whole lot that we had to fight about .,art
yeah i am proud of it .,art
i am happy to have got to be a part of it .,art
and i think it is a good a good solid show .,art
yeah that wa going to be my next question .,art
a you bring this healthy wholesome kid story into netflix which for me i imagine that it is somewhat of a meat grinder to take a good idea and twist it around into some woke zombie version of what it once wa .,art
to hear that it came out true to the original vision is thats pretty encouraging to me .,art
yeah god wa very kind .,art
and i think we we were teamed up with the people .,art
and netflix this wa before this wa before two thousand and twenty .,art
this wa before thing that netflix went extremely woke .,art
they already were but there no way that two white guy myself and nate could go make a show about a little japanese boy today with netflix at least .,art
and maybe itll swing back who know .,art
but we i think we snuck in at the tail end of when that would be acceptable and workable .,art
yeah i do not know .,art
the biggest lesson wa all i can do is the best that i can do at the time .,art
and if god chooses to bless it then no one going to stop him .,art
that wa it .,art
maybe you could say more about that because i imagine that there are probably some parent listening and listening and probably some some creatives a who of course ive had my own creative process that ive been involved in .,art
again photography wa a big one for me .,art
but maybe you can speak more about that about trust doing the best you can and trusting god with the result .,art
yeah thats pretty much it .,art
it is you want to do the best you can that if god doe bless it you are not embarrassed once it is out there and fake .,art
but also that if you make something to a certain if you make something excellent it will get out there .,art
i think cream rise .,art
but the the rising thats all god .,art
a an artist all you can focus on focus on is making great cream .,art
do what you can to make your craft a excellent a possible .,art
position yourself if you can with the people to make it go .,art
but we plant water but it is god who brings the increase .,art
everything ive worked on since ninja is ha not gone a nearly a explosive .,art
but i am it doesnt bother me because i am still i know i am doing the same thing that i wa doing then for whatever reason nothing ha worked out quite the same way .,art
but god god is the one thats going to bless it or not when he feel it .,art
i think there real wisdom of that .,art
ive had some tweet go mega viral around the world .,art
and if i keep trying to achieve that same thing again not even maybe i maybe ill get there but ill drive myself crazy trying to do it .,art
when ultimately when something that is happening it is this is clearly a god thing .,art
and praise him for making this possible .,art
but i am not gon na i am not gon na be able to make lightning strike twice .,art
i have to do the best job that i can with everything that i put my hand to .,art
and god will take care of the rest .,art
you said something interesting too .,art
you said put your all into it that you are not embarrassed .,art
because i guess it is possible that something could do .,art
and it is there a typo there or there a mistake there .,art
god can do that a which i i tend to forget that. . and ninja wa interesting because the first version of the book that you apparently have somewhere in a box .,art
i wa a student when i made it .,art
it wa a little bit i look at it now and i think wow thats i could do much better .,art
i did what i could .,art
and he took it and ran with it .,art
and then we ended up selling the book right to harper collins .,art
and they went they went and made four four new ninja book .,art
we remade the first book .,art
we made another one .,art
and then we made two spin off .,art
and i wa able to go back and recreate the first book with four year of artistic expertise under my belt which i wa grateful for .,art
i could tinker with it once it wa already out there which is not an opportunity that is often given to artist .,art
yes i can i can relate to that where i go back and listen to something maybe an interview that i did or something that .,art
and i look at that and it is i would do that much better. . thats part of it .,art
maybe you can talk a little bit about thinking back on your experience a an artist especially for the parent who are listening what can what can they do ?,art
what helped you cultivate your gift and ability that wa unique to your upbringing ?,art
maybe some some teacher that made a difference maybe some thing that your parent did that gave you an added push in your gift .,art
because i imagine there probably more than a few parent listening that have spotted what they think or what might even be genuine artistic talent and interest in their child .,art
and that they do not know how to cultivate that because they do not have it themselves .,art
you can share a little bit about that maybe some of the individual or some of the decision that were made for you to help to help shepherd you in a particular direction .,art
i think there two two answer to that question .,art
the first is that my parent were never concerned about my desire to become an artist .,art
they were only ever encouraging which i wa very grateful for because instead of making me complacent and lazy in my pursuit of artistic excellence i only ever wanted to please them .,art
it wa it wa encouraging that they were only ever encouraging obviously .,art
they werent trying to hold me back or they werent asking me question how are you going to make money ?,art
maybe they ought to have been .,art
they never worried about it .,art
they only ever encouraged me bought me art supply gave me art lesson .,art
and that made me want to work hard to not let them down i guess .,art
and then my high school basketball coach i credit him the most with the work ethic .,art
even interest only get you far .,art
you can love something you can be good at it .,art
but unless you are unless you have the skill set the muscle memory that it take to show up and put the work in all that interest and intent is not going to go anywhere .,art
i learned my work ethic what little work ethic i have come from high school basketball .,art
high school basketball wa where i learned to keep pushing even when i wanted to lie down and give up and be done .,art
athletics combined with nothing but encouragement from my parent i think enabled me to make it a a professional artist .,art
and then ill say one more thing .,art
our high school basketball team wa not very good .,art
we lost a lot .,art
and at the end of the game the score wa always objective and it did not care about how you felt .,art
artist can tend to be coddled .,art
their emotion can be coddled by their parent by their peer because the artistic temperament is given a free pas because thats the way that artist are .,art
and let not well leave them there .,art
they are weird .,art
they are weird but they need artist need to be in absolute control of their emotion that when you put something out into the world and it doesnt go it is you are not affected by it .,art
develop a thick skin get used to losing but do not ever settle with losing .,art
keep grinding keep pushing always be chasing that excellence .,art
can you talk a little bit more about that ?,art
because it seems that tie into some of what we said about nonreactivity .,art
it tie into discipline and it tie in also to the only way that we achieve excellence is through failure ?,art
and i think that there a tendency that we have in culture today and i think it show up across culture to not tell somebody when theyve failed at something which doe them a great disservice .,art
you have to you said a basketball score is objective .,art
but if we are afraid to tell somebody when it doesnt how will they know what it take to produce something that doe ?,art
and i think a lot of the hesitation that people have is i do not want to hurt their feeling .,art
maybe they need their feeling to be hurt .,art
they do not intentionally hurt their feeling ?,art
i am going to get them but you have to maybe you can talk to them because you had to work through that .,art
every professional artist that ive ever met ha had to work through countless failure emotionally ?,art
the thing that they liked they put that out there and it is no it doesnt work .,art
this is amazing ?,art
maybe you can talk some because thats the professional side of being an artist .,art
yeah it is it is cliche .,art
it is not how many time you get hit but how many time you get back up .,art
it is can you do it over and over again ?,art
and yeah being an artist you are putting your whole soul into something .,art
when you are creating it it is you are you are god .,art
this is amazing .,art
it is the inspiration is flowing .,art
and then you put it out there .,art
it get ten like on social medium which is or or you put it out there you can not see your mom and they go thats nice .,art
slap it on the fridge and it is in the in the trash the next day .,art
yeah it is funny .,art
this is my girl will not stop drawing which is good .,art
they are they are good at it and they love it .,art
they are making book constantly .,art
but this is something that we are dealing with there six and four but when i throw away their drawing all the time because at first i wa trying to keep everything because i did not want to hurt their feeling .,art
and i wanted to i wanted to have this record of this pure artistic expression .,art
but i realized quickly that that wa not helping them grow .,art
well put it on the fridge for a day maybe .,art
and then it is in the trash because it is onto the next one .,art
if it is excellent ill stick it in a frame put it on the wall .,art
but and once yeah now they are they are comfortable with their drawing being trashed all the time not by me but thrown into the trash .,art
and thats i think it is a thats the mindset that i think every artist need to cultivate is that the work is work .,art
it is not who you are .,art
it is it is it is something that you are producing in order to bless other people .,art
if they are not blessed by it you can not get offended at that .,art
if you put it out there and nobody like it all that tell me is that you put it out there a because you wanted praise you wanted your own ego to be scratched and you wanted your friend to say wow i could never do that .,art
but the whole point is that you are making food for somebody el soul .,art
you want them to be uplifted encouraged inspired .,art
then if you frame it that way you put something you put a painting up on the wall and nobody is uplifted or encouraged that wouldnt make any sense to throw a fit about that .,art
and then hopefully it will achieve it goal .,art
can you talk about if youd be willing to one of your experience where there wa something that you were particularly attached to and you put it out there and it maybe went over a lead balloon and you had to work through that ?,art
maybe there have been too many to count but i can not remember .,art
i think my ditch might be on the other side where i preemptively despise my own work that when somebody else doesnt it i can i beat you to it .,art
i also think it is not any good .,art
there that other thats i think thats my ditch is to be a little more to cut the cord a little too readily maybe or to be to throw it out there and move on .,art
yeah i can not sorry i can not recall a time when i wa devastated that somebody did not what i did .,art
i am sure it happened .,art
i know it happened but i do not know .,art
no what i am getting at i think and that make a lot of sense that you would preemptively dismiss your own work for fear of being hurt and you are that is definitely a ditch .,art
it is easier to leave something unfinished or keep it private than to subject it to someone looking at it .,art
and because you think something is amazing doesnt mean anyone else will but you also have to think it is amazing too .,art
maybe i am i do not know i am putting my thought together the way .,art
thats all it all make sense .,art
i think yeah going back to the other ditch where if you are out there trashing your own work before anyone else can thats a selfish a looking for the ego trip where you are looking for praise .,art
either you are looking for praise or you throw it out there and then you say it is bad .,art
thats a selfish and a gross .,art
you should stop it .,art
it is and it is also a disservice to the to your audience .,art
if you throw something out there and it doe connect it doe bless them they do it .,art
and then you are out there saying it is no good .,art
you are telling those people that their taste is bad and that this thing that they genuinely had affection for is dumb from maybe one of their hero it is trashing your own work is selfish .,art
looking for praise is selfish .,art
the whole point is i said to bless somebody else .,art
if it is about you it is going to end in tear .,art
it is challenging because at the end of the day you are the one that ha to make it .,art
it is your taste your skill level your time blood sweat and tear that is going into this project .,art
you do have to it .,art
and you do have to know it intimately inside and out to make it before you can ship it .,art
but at the end of the day you are cooking a meal you are making something to feed somebody else .,art
and when you look at it that way you do not want to be the chef that put something on the table and say yes i could have done better .,art
or there wasnt a much salt .,art
and everyones enjoying the meal .,art
and you are over here saying yeah it wasnt salty enough .,art
sorry apologizing for it and ruining everybodys experience .,art
put it out there and make a flag a note .,art
next time the meal will be a little bit better .,art
next time itll be a little bit better .,art
and do not make it about yourself once you start once it is out there .,art
can you think addressing the other ditch then can you think of when you had to learn how to accept praise ?,art
because that is definitely a thing where people do not know how to graciously someone say thats amazing .,art
and if the tendency is to say no no it is terrible no you want to honor them in their experience maybe you can talk about that .,art
yeah this is going back to basketball one of my friend one of my teammate his dad told him look at the end of the game if somebody say good game doesnt matter if you won or lost all you have to say back is good game .,art
you do not you do not need to say i shot poorly or yeah and then or flatter them .,art
and you did great too .,art
and then if somebody yeah the more i make thing the more i realize that it is not it is i am showing up and putting stuff together .,art
but the idea and the art come from somewhere else .,art
i am an archaeologist discovering something .,art
thats what it feel .,art
when somebody else come and say i loved this i am i am free to say thank you .,art
i also thought that wa great .,art
wasnt it awesome ?,art
and it is this it is something thats divorced from my own ego my own pride .,art
and we are free to enjoy it together because now it is out there .,art
it doesnt belong to me anymore .,art
it is this artifact floating in the wild .,art
yeah if somebody praise you say thank you .,art
thats it .,art
and it is yeah then you bite your tongue .,art
i still feel that .,art
do not say ill do better next time or do not trash your work .,art
but definitely definitely do not rely on praise a a fuel to keep you going .,art
it is praise is nice .,art
it is encouraging .,art
but it is not you are not gon na you never learn from it .,art
say say more about that .,art
you are the best .,art
i wish i could draw you whatever it is .,art
and then that becomes your the end goal of what it is you are doing .,art
that praise is it is gon na stunt your growth because you are not gon na learn anything .,art
if you do not if you throw something out there no one offering constructive criticism .,art
they are they are making your head a little bit bigger .,art
and the worst thing you can do a a creative is learn to rely on that or to even worse to love it to love praise .,art
you should you should always feel a little bit uncomfortable when somebody say great job this is awesome .,art
you do not and praise is good because it mean that somebody else wa blessed .,art
thats thats all it tell you .,art
but if you throw something out there and you get a criticism thats helpful data .,art
because now you can go back and say this did not land either because the audience missed it or because i failed to deliver .,art
and if i failed to deliver then you can go say how wa it this story ?,art
wa it color drawing ?,art
and then you can dissect it .,art
and maybe they maybe the audience picked up on something that they think is the problem but you have to be intelligent enough to identify the problem somewhere else .,art
you fix it over here and then that particular reaction go away if that make any sense .,art
that when people do not something thats when i pay attention .,art
because then i then you have to ask why did not they it ?,art
is it their problem ?,art
is it my problem ?,art
is it the worst problem ?,art
and then once you identify a problem then there an opportunity for education and growth .,art
and thats exciting .,art
growth is always fun .,art
and thats why it is important to subject yourself to valid criticism even though it might hurt your feeling even though you have an emotional attachment to something .,art
the royal u of course thats the way that you are going to grow is by finding out what work and what did not from an objective observer not friend not family ?,art
who they of course they are going to love what you do because they love you .,art
but there is something about no you put it up and you let the public look at it and you let them tear it apart .,art
yeah it is terrible but you got to do it .,art
yeah absolutely .,art
maybe you can share a little bit with maybe some of the project that you have coming up for either cannonball or cannon press or what you are working on what you are working on yourself .,art
yeah now i am working full time with cannon press on some animation content that is we are trying to get a now there a show and a feature that we are building out elaborate pitch deck for .,art
i am doing some short sample animation for these project that we will then go out and attempt to wrangle some funding for .,art
thats what i am doing full time now .,art
i am painting on the side .,art
there the gallery that you saw a a new addition to moscow owned by or run by new st. andrew college .,art
i am supplying some painting there .,art
and then i am working on a graphic novel on the other side a . those are the main project that ive got going at the moment .,art
you are how do you i guess you are all it sound you are always creating something whether you are at work or whether you are working in the graphic novel or you are painting .,art
is this a constant state of i guess a state of mind that you are in ?,art
it is all yeah .,art
the short answer is yes .,art
i will say that sunday are extremely important .,art
and you start to understand the way that why god did it the way that he did because i can i know that i can all six cylinder for six week run flat out knowing that on sunday i can collapse and spend time with my family and rest .,art
yeah sunday are extra extra sweet these day .,art
do you have a day set aside or a time of the week set aside to do your painting ?,art
this is because i would imagine there something very personal about that .,art
this is for me .,art
this is what i am doing .,art
or maybe i am wrong about that but it would seem to me that this is something that requires such focus and there a degree of intimacy to it a . or is it whenever it come up during the week ?,art
and then maybe ill do a little bit of work but usually i try to get to bed early that i can get up early again the next day .,art
the rhythm of a professional artist sound a professional anything .,art
yes it turn out it is work .,art
you mean you are not up at three oclock in the morning waiting for the muse to appear ?,art
but it is yeah sometimes it show up .,art
but i am there whether or not the muse is there .,art
thats the goal .,art
and you are working on real quickly you are working on animation now .,art
i think you had mentioned earlier that you wanted to be getting into animation and now you finally worked your way around to that .,art
yeah it is i am very grateful for how thats worked out .,art
we do not nothing is nailed down yet but we are all hopeful we have project that we .,art
but it is yeah i am doing traditional handdrawn animation and it is extremely fun .,art
some of the most fun ive had in my entire career i would say. . handdrawn cell animation ?,art
yeah it is not it is not on paper .,art
we are we are drawing directly on the computer .,art
but still all we are doing is we are skipping the scanning process .,art
other than that it is the same. . my goodness .,art
see that is something .,art
now i am going to say that is something i could never do .,art
yeah it is absurd .,art
i can not it doesnt yeah it is a lot of work .,art
a lot of very detailoriented micro work in a way the subtle change of a facial expression .,art
i couldnt do it. . and back to how we started this conversation .,art
this is why when i am painting i am trying to be sloppy and loose and relax and have fun .,art
because during my day job i am worrying about turning a character in threedimensional space on a page and it is there math involved it is complicated .,art
see that make a lot of sense .,art
we started talking about the difference between a crispen and the impressionistic painting in the gallery .,art
i know youve got a lot of work to do today .,art
thank you much for the generosity of your time and walking me and walking u through your artwork .,art
is there some place that people can go online to find a gallery of your painting or image of your painting or something that ?,art
yeah forestdickison.com is you can go there .,art
there a newsletter to sign up for .,art
the only time i send out a newsletter is when i have new painting which is rare these day .,art
but then you can find me on instagram .,art
i do have a twitter but mostly i repost painting of dead people .,art
thats not my own work .,art
painting of dead people ?,art
yeah the master the old the old dead guy who knew how to paint .,art
i repost what i on my twitter .,art
painting of dead people .,art
i should say painting by dead people .,art
thats not a terrible .,art
whatever we do not need to go there .,art
painting by old master who are now deceased but because their painting are still around theyve stood the test of time and they are great painting of dead people .,art
thats terrible .,art
what is the way to sign off ?,art
thats great .,art
who are some of your favorite master ?,art
my favorite dead people .,art
yes exactly .,art
your favorite painting of dead people .,art
thats great .,art
i love the old japanese master yoshida hiroshi in particular .,art
i love the california impressionist .,art
edgar payne william wint are some of my favorite .,art
i love the end page of christmas or any day are a nod to nc wyeth. . and recently ive been reading a biography of the artist maynard dixon who wa painting a little before nc wyeth in the american southwest .,art
yeah those are some of my gotos .,art
ive always been a big fan of alfred bierstadt and casper david friedreich .,art
i originally liked the wonder about the sea of fog .,art
i think thats still a classic painting but there are many others of his that they are beautiful .,art
yeah thats a good one .,art
and bierstadts landscape of the american west is time traveling .,art
yeah those are great .,art
thank you much again for your time .,art
be sure to send people to your website and your twitter .,art
thank you much forrest .,art
yeah thanks for having me will .,art
take care .,art
take care .,art
the lighting wa great the scene the environment and my eye made that connection .,art
for me light and color there a certain frequency i have to feel when you listen to music and that rhythm hit you .,art
claudio eschen i am super excited to talk to you .,art
i am very excited to be here dude .,art
a lot of the other people that have been on before you have lot of conversation especially when we are driving out to take photograph .,art
and i am excited that you are cool sitting down and recording one of those conversation .,art
and much appreciated .,art
i do not know can you give a little bit about your background ?,art
i think your story is fantastic .,art
and i think you appreciate how much that or understand how much i appreciate you being a part of the team and our friendship .,art
i know now you are part of the story and journey too .,art
i wa born in ghana at the age of two moved to italy .,art
and then at the age of nine moved to whistler massachusetts where my family and i currently live .,art
and then ever since then i grew up trying to find myself a i wa undocumented still i am .,art
but through that journey i wa able to land in bridgewater state where they accepted me without looking at any financial background .,art
and then i pursued a biology degree .,art
and through that i wa a freelance photographer .,art
i wa passionate to photography to the point .,art
there wa a point where i had to choose if i wanted to pursue a career in biology or art .,art
and thats where i ended up finding a job a social medium job post in from you guy .,art
and i wa what i think i am going to go to grad school at massart .,art
and while i am at grad school at massart i want to pursue a more of our artistic career .,art
and thats where i met you and introduced myself saying not only i can do social medium but i can do photography and other versatile creative task .,art
and since two thousand and nineteen ive been here and spend that life .,art
and ever since ive learned a lot about framing how to present work and starting to be that professional artist .,art
i wa more of a freelance artist .,art
i wa taken but i wa a little nervous on being gallery represented .,art
i honestly felt i did not think i wa worthy enough or it felt very alienating .,art
i think that thats probably part of that imposter syndrome that everybody ha including podcasts .,art
i even mentioned to you your brother one time i had imposter syndrome about being a photographer because i never thought this early in my career .,art
and i am twenty seven to be a professional photographer be acquired by museum have conversation with student teach college student photography .,art
the reason why i also talk about that .,art
me with my immigration background i felt difficulty sometimes in the real world .,art
i felt the digital world there wa no citizenship type situation where you can bring yourself everywhere and still be in one place .,art
and now i am here trying to continue that journey .,art
no i think your story is great .,art
i appreciate all the hard work that you do in watching you go through school go through graduate school working at other job .,art
because you were working doing the overnight showing up here to put in some hour before going to graduate school .,art
it is much appreciated because i think that everything you get rid of that imposter syndrome once you have done something long enough and youve hit the fast forward button and you are blasting through a lot of it .,art
it is impressive .,art
thank you .,art
but then also having fun with it i used to be a control freak with a lot of the making .,art
i let that go a lot of it to have more enjoyment in the process .,art
you have that wide cherry looking frame that youve used in the ton of stuff .,art
this one here you found one of the one that you have .,art
yeah i stood out to me .,art
it wa the texture the hint of gold .,art
and it started trickling or doing something to me inside when i paired it with this print light shine from her finger taken in two thousand and twenty one that wa also part of the hanover day show .,art
and i do not know that combination and the tone of color .,art
no it work fantastic .,art
i think it is cool that it is an older looking frame with a new more contemporary looking photograph .,art
it tie in the thing .,art
and a little bit of the background of the photograph .,art
i photograph my family and friend a lot .,art
and this print is my mom who a hairdresser who started at the age of twelve .,art
and then my sister who wa a cosmetology major in her vocational school .,art
and that trickle of passing on not only dna information but the root of learning hairdressing and my sister having that appreciation .,art
and highlighting theme of ritual practice and passing on information .,art
now weve talked a couple of time too .,art
some of the stuff that you are trying to do is bring awareness to your culture from ghana and whatnot .,art
is the hair stuff .,art
yeah hair braiding is known in the african community a lot .,art
and my mom learned hair braiding in a very traditional sense .,art
and because she wa at the age of twelve and now shes in her 50 that whole journey of carrying that skill set everywhere she went and finding way to create a business out of it .,art
how do they feel about being subject for you when you are shooting ?,art
i will say at first .,art
ive seen your mom in a couple shot .,art
ill be honest .,art
at first it wa a push and pull .,art
but with the ritualness of me photographing the practice of constantly doing it and then showing them and then having a conversation about why i am making the work and what they see and feel .,art
after a while they started to understand and to the point once the camera is out they ready to pose .,art
i will say with my mom and sister it wa way more easier .,art
with my brother it took some time .,art
a lot of the early work you do not see him and some people are you have a brother ?,art
and i am yeah i have a brother .,art
and after a few conversation with him and how i am trying to also express the male figure side of our family .,art
and he now is on board .,art
i think it is cool .,art
it is interesting to see subject over and over again .,art
people paint the same type of scene .,art
to see them grow too with the photograph and if you continue to shoot them they become older .,art
it is a cool thing .,art
i do not know what the technical term for something that is .,art
bailey portraiture work .,art
i do have phase where now i am trying to work more with object and garment and trying to mix it up .,art
it is not too overly people centered .,art
and then also thinking about how to photograph environment without people in it .,art
and now you also added a couple piece over at the james that we got to peek at last night at the opening reception .,art
pretty received .,art
it is surprising .,art
lurking shadow in the state house .,art
and she talked le to do more .,art
and lurking shadow in the state house is the guy with the .,art
and the kente cloth .,art
and thats a traditional ghana .,art
thats textile fabric that it is very known there .,art
and i wanted to use that very fabric that gentleman is me .,art
someone said that to me and i looked at it and i wa it doesnt look i tried .,art
thats the don claude side that come out .,art
and i try to morph myself because it is sometimes difficult to find men of color to work with .,art
and either schedule conflict doesnt work .,art
ive been shifting myself to transform into a figure who is a male figure to do performative act in front of the camera that .,art
and then the kente cloth since with my immigration background i can not leave the country .,art
i have conversation with my family in ghana by having them send material to me in america and that garment wa sent to by my aunt who owns a story in ghana .,art
and i wa wearing it and remembering .,art
. . and thats interesting .,art
i think it is cool that you are part of the subject matter also .,art
but is that tricky ?,art
and it is tricky but is part of that staging .,art
you have somebody else hit the button .,art
i have somebody staging hitting the button to the point .,art
that day wa windy .,art
i had somebody day to keep an eye on the camera from shaking .,art
the first few try i clicked wasnt working .,art
after that i made sure to my assistant to help me click .,art
because i wasnt getting back in time .,art
it is it go to show how thought out there .,art
and up the two that wa the one that came that got second place .,art
and which i never know how juror go about it .,art
but yeah i wa hoping that she talked le to do more .,art
that that shot is me and don were talking about that this morning because when i saw which one were there i immediately assumed that that wa the one that one because that shot is it is it is a perfect shot .,art
i think it is great .,art
and i do not know a lot about the technical end of taking those photograph .,art
i more at the the back end i see a lot of thing when i am getting ready to frame them and that one is perfect and it is i do not know if it is the lighting .,art
no it is definitely the lighting .,art
the way you staged it .,art
because when i saw it and that family the lahans family reached out to me to do a portrait family portrait for them .,art
every time somebody hire me for a job or a gig in the back of my head i always want to make one or two image .,art
that resonate with the body of work i am creating .,art
in the process the lighting wa great the scene the environment and my eye made that connection .,art
for me light and color there certain frequency i have to feel when you listen to music and that rhythm hit you .,art
and because of that the lighting i wa this is perfect .,art
and i told jeff to stand stale the gentleman in the background and ask his family and his wife and child to walk towards him while he standing still .,art
and i took a few shot but then there wa the leg of the child of the young child brought me back into my own young self when i wa a little wild and a little stubborn and want to be playful all the time .,art
but and then there the hiding my mom face or a woman who represented my mom a shes not a woman who talk a lot .,art
shes more about action .,art
that that wa what wa going on .,art
how is that ?,art
and you show up to that shoot and you in that piece together are they receptive or it took some time .,art
because they are they are supposed to be taking our picture .,art
which i did .,art
because i know this child involved you guy are involved and i want to be respectful of that .,art
and once i got the approval i wa very thankful and pleased and they even came to my show and they signed in person and they they understood and they are they excited and proud to be that .,art
and when i see that you could see that that could be a magazine shot that you could see it in a museum that .,art
thats the one thats in the harvard .,art
don we are having the conversation when i wa this morning i wa telling her how we are going to sit down and we are talking about that when i wa thats not the one that got the prize and same thing .,art
it is that could be the photograph you hang your hat on .,art
i am sure that youll produce other one that are you got a long way to go but that one is stunning .,art
no thank you .,art
no i would highly recommend people stop by because there some other great work there too .,art
and did you get to meet the woman that won the show .,art
yes first .,art
yes the water reflection .,art
it is wild how it look a real a you would be in the caribbean and the clear water scene .,art
shes wild .,art
i wa talking with bill and the guy who jared who doe the sculpture who ha a show coming up there .,art
we were closing up the place and she wa still there and i got introduced to her because bill is you should meet .,art
interesting woman .,art
interesting backstory too .,art
yes and i love how shes hustling or how she hustled to get where shes at and now shes an educator at tuft too .,art
shes holland .,art
i forgot her last name but i wanted to say at least say the first name .,art
yeah she wa an intern for warhol .,art
that wa crazy .,art
but super interesting lady .,art
she said that you want to come to the thing because i wa asking her how she made it and she wa telling me and hopefully ill get a chance to follow up with her .,art
and try to talk to her more because she seemed super interesting .,art
yeah how shes collecting recycled bottle and repurposing them .,art
i love that whole initiative .,art
the whole story wa fascinating and to come to the second place to her is .,art
a soon a i saw it online and in person too i honestly understood .,art
yeah i understood .,art
truthfully entering contest grant .,art
it is always once you enter you also got to let go of it a little .,art
not take it personal .,art
i feel ive had that conversation with a number of people too and it is always the judge .,art
who know who the judge is and who know if they have a bias against something that you are a style or they want to see all cat picture .,art
or maybe they landscape more than portrait .,art
because in their head they are putting together something too .,art
and youve been on the other side of thing .,art
and ive been a juror once and it wa for a college student show and it wa very intense because it wa what over three hundred submission and you have to choose three and i ended up giving my stipend away to make it four .,art
because i wa yeah there a lot of good work .,art
and i applaud people who do this on a regular basis .,art
yeah my guess is that youll probably be doing some more of it at some point .,art
but you think about it .,art
they are essentially curating a show which i know youve had experience with that .,art
i saw the show you put together at massart .,art
a they are selecting the stuff they are i do not know .,art
maybe they pick out i that one a lot .,art
i that one there no tie in but somebody got to then hang them and .,art
youd to think that they are somewhat conscious of they are putting a body of work together .,art
i am not thinking something .,art
i do not know interesting .,art
i also want to break out this one .,art
yeah the .,art
let switch the room real quick .,art
that one is this is one of your early work .,art
this is while i wa in undergrad at bridgewater state every weekend or i would have photo shoot with people on campus friend .,art
and kyla wa one of the people that i wanted to work with .,art
shes very energetic bubbly i wa the color yellow would be a good way for her to highlight her personality .,art
prior to going to grad school i wasnt thinking about the work a much a more of going what what aesthetically wa pleasing to me .,art
and then from there i started shifting towards my mom .,art
but yeah this is one of the first early work and i wa very excited because i wa stepping away from the traditional way of framing .,art
and i used to either go michael a walmart for framing .,art
and this is a whole new shift when i came across frame center .,art
yeah frame and the relationship of how to present the work .,art
yeah i think we even used this we framed it two different way to show it show how you can use frame and how there not always there not always a or a wrong .,art
some thing look better than others but some of thats personal and whats to me might not be to you or a a photographer i guess you are trying to get whats to a larger part of the audience that people are drawn in .,art
but we did it the two way and i think we even put it out and got feedback from again not not a not a wrong .,art
i am glad i ended up with this one .,art
yes there only two of them thats good .,art
yeah no it it mean a lot to me this wa the one that you gave me for i do not know maybe weve got the year on it .,art
two thousand and twenty one .,art
yes that one in i the yellow a little bit better that wa my choice in the beginning anyway but where it go is where it hang it ha the brightness work for me .,art
the frame in of it and the texture of the frame and the texture of the orange it wa wild to me .,art
yeah yeah and i think thats what gravitates toward wow start thinking about presentation .,art
with anything exciting coming up i know that you are working on another interesting project with that with the yes if you are not ready to unveil that .,art
you are from worcester .,art
yeah you do not know that .,art
nice and you said are you working specifically with a few gallery now too ?,art
now thirteen horace gallery is going to be the gallery thats going to represent me .,art
we are slowing the work of finalizing thing but i am very much excited for them to represent me a ive had many conversation with them that came to many of my show .,art
we had a few studio visit in my studio in boston it is i felt it wa the time and the fit .,art
i am sure it will work out for you and i said hopefully that doesnt mean you can not hit your head over to his next year .,art
theyll still let you put some stuff out in other place .,art
harvard another one too that working there is that an interesting ... it definitely is .,art
the creative process a you are teaching some of that stuff too i feel you are reinforcing the belief that you need too .,art
it help you become that master .,art
talking about master helped me even become a better problem solver ill say with the idea because theyll come with the project i am what ?,art
and then trying to break it down and work backwards and execute it especially in a very short timely manner .,art
yeah and you still can learn from the student too ?,art
me and jacob talked about that a while back about how you ... people that need to learn come with great idea .,art
awesome i am excited you sat down with me i am trying to think if there any other thing i wanted to ask you about .,art
i feel there going to be more .,art
i feel you are around i can probably get you back here .,art
but fantastic photographer and great guy and i am excited to see what else what come next and i love seeing you get more involved down this area too .,art
it is a challenge but it is the great thing about those ride when we are going to some of those place that hopefully well see more of your work at .,art

good morning good afternoon good evening wherever you may be watching u from .,art
welcome to the talent plug podcast a space where we pretty much dive deep into different and varied career choice that individual take up .,art
i am your host francis malomban .,art
in this episode weve got a very interesting personality .,art
shes a friend of mine somebody that i have seen evolve over time .,art
her story is very interesting in the sense that shell talk about it .,art
yeah but gwana thank you much for coming through to the talent plug podcast .,art
a pleasure to see you and have you .,art
thank you for having me .,art
all there is much i want to ask you that i might skip the intro which is the most important thing .,art
before we do that let get into how no let get into whom gwana is .,art
tell u a bit about yourself .,art
i always find it hard to answer a question because i am a lot of thing .,art
ive come to realize i am a lot of thing .,art
but recently someone one ill start .,art
what do you mean by that ?,art
i think one person wa brave enough to tell me you are freaking weird but it wa a good weird .,art
i am wait and also i wa in the face of my life where i wa doing a lot of introspection .,art
i wa i realized a lot of thing about life .,art
what do they mean when they said you are weird ?,art
this is what i am about to explain .,art
and i think i do not know why specifically but on face value someone will think theyve clocked me .,art
they know that shes this .,art
but when they get to know me i could be not different but off of what they thought .,art
youve got split personality .,art
i am resistant to that .,art
if i could break out in hive i would probably .,art
but then i do not always i do not put it out there .,art
i do not show up everywhere .,art
hey i am thats me .,art
and i think it is only recently when ive started trying to do that intentionally but obviously managed in a managed way .,art
anyway someone described me a weird .,art
i wa talking to someone else another person that i met and got to know .,art
thats how weird i am .,art
ill ask you that .,art
because i could tell they were when you are getting to know people you have your first impression and then i easily break people first impression .,art
thats another thing .,art
i could tell that they were in that space where they are i think this person is trying to figure me out and they can not .,art
i wa presenting the opportunity to talk about it. . yeah .,art
then they were no you are not weird .,art
you are free spirited and you are focused and what you want .,art
and i am for the first time someone ha described me in a way that i can agree .,art
and in a way that thats particularly relevant at that time .,art
yeah. . very very interesting .,art
youve talked about the personality that you have .,art
speak a little bit about the upbringing that you had because i pretty much want to understand how youve gotten to this level .,art
obviously you are bringing played a very pivotal role in shaping who you are now .,art
can you speak about that ? .,art
where can i start ?,art
most of what i can see about my upbringing it is stuff that ive processed and realized a of going older obviously. . i grew up very curious .,art
and i think i spent a lot of time alone. . being an only girl .,art
it is me and my older brother. . being an only girl .,art
i wa always the little sister thats tagging along with my brother and he chased me .,art
but ill be i am coming or ill cry or manipulate you now .,art
i grew up i think people would describe me a a tomboy. . i enjoyed being outside .,art
i enjoyed being active climbing tree and playing football. . but i wa also smart .,art
i would use my girliness but it wa convenient .,art
for example if i am losing at the game and then ill start i am no i said i did what exactly. . and then my brother is there .,art
his friend are my older brother .,art
it protects me a even if they are frustrated .,art
i grew up not stereotypical girl and very early in my life getting pretty adolescent face .,art
i started realizing i can not be a human girl and this boy .,art
i struggled with that .,art
also i think my parent and my dad specifically wa very intentional about not how can i say not enabling society to define you yeah yeah a girl and you play with doll and whatever .,art
it wa very intentional about that .,art
i remember specifically he would the toy that i had were gender neutral .,art
i only had one door and it wa the door .,art
it wa there for some time .,art
i did not relate to having a door for me i would rather have had a door that ha organ and what and i can open it up .,art
but it had it had brown skin .,art
it had brown skin .,art
that wa also very intentional because i think he did not want the whole .,art
funny story .,art
i used to run out .,art
there one time my brother friend younger sister wait should i tell this story ?,art
anyway i do not think they are listening .,art
i do not think they are listening .,art
but there wa a thing where now i am getting into adolescence .,art
my aunty and my mom and i think this is what i concluded ?,art
where now making an effort to say tell my brother do not take her with you because now shes getting into a girly age and we want her to stop playing with boy .,art
if anything find your friend sister i wanted to play with her .,art
one of the girl came over .,art
they organized a play date for me .,art
but i have my own idea .,art
and i do not telling me what not to do. . she came over .,art
i gave it a chance .,art
i did not know what wa happening .,art
this is all in hindsight when i figured out that thats what they were doing .,art
but i wa fine fine fine .,art
let her come one time and get off my back and move on back to my sport .,art
she came over and she had this barbie a play set and and tea .,art
i am this is not for me .,art
i would go and get a mini meal from the house. . and i would cook feed me and my crew raw stuff .,art
someone got sick at some point .,art
then she came over and i ran away from her .,art
i went to lock myself in my room .,art
and then i remember the help at the time had to come and look for me the chick wa outside waiting .,art
i wa i can not play with i can not i can not do this .,art
it wa at that point you realized this is not for me .,art
yeah needle to say i think my brother wa very ashamed .,art
yeah but yeah i thats how i grew up i guess .,art
i do not know if you want to know anything else .,art
thats thats pretty much decent .,art
thanks much for sharing .,art
i think something that wa skipped wa pretty much highlighting the journey and the transition that you have made throughout your your upbringing and obviously part of the other hood a . id for you to speak into how your journey ha evolved over time .,art
kindly run u through how you started out in term of the professional setup what you studied and what you are ultimately doing now .,art
relating to my upbringing one thing i forgot to mention is my dad wa always an entrepreneur. . i remember he worked for paris state or something .,art
anyway a government something for a bit .,art
and then after that he went into music business. . yeah .,art
for the longest time ive always known him to be an entrepreneur and obviously starting out back then .,art
selling music essentially music related product .,art
it wa a new thing .,art
at some point in the beginning family wa involved every employee wa the family member. . and we i remember when the first shop wa open we had to go and paint and da da da da funny story .,art
i ate styrofoam and got sick and poisoned ourselves me and my cousin .,art
i wa they are corn puff .,art
we had to look for ish .,art
it wa a problem .,art
hold it being hand on your hand .,art
and i wa curious. . and i believe you couldnt tell me anything you do not answer my question all the more reason to go and figure it out myself. . you are better off answering my question .,art
i always that rubbed off onto me .,art
and it wa the natural thing for me that when i grow up i am going to be an entrepreneur .,art
i am going to do my own thing run my own business and that thing .,art
i grew up with that .,art
and then even when i went to uni and did a degree i always had that in mind. . it is been with me .,art
what did you study ?,art
why that career choice ?,art
for the specific reason that by that time id realized by the time it wa time to go to uni id realized that i need to be doing something that i love doing something that i am interested in .,art
but where i wa where we are from in zambia and especially at that time i would have if i would grew up in a different environment in the western environment for example i probably would have been in an art school a dance school music school something .,art
who influenced that decision to study marketing ?,art
it wa myself .,art
because why why did not you pursue those those field ?,art
you i did not know it wa an option .,art
i did not know it wa an option because i did not know that i would be able to go even i went to uct university of cape town and they have a school of dance .,art
but i did not know until i got there .,art
i grew up thinking i am probably going to go to unsa one of these place .,art
then i started looking at my option i do not know if you remember but i left in palembe in grade eleven first term because then i started seeing there are option to go and study abroad and what you need to do that .,art
i left because i wanted to do alevels and condense my program that i do not get into university too late. . yeah .,art
all that wa me realizing that those were possible option .,art
and then out of all the option i had in term of my grade and what i could be accepted in marketing wa the closest thing to being creative and being free .,art
for me ive always had a thing about i need to be free .,art
yes i need to be free .,art
i need to be free to be me .,art
i think there only one you .,art
that wa i knew i had nothing an accountant .,art
even if i did those thing i am sure i would do it in a way where i wa still able to integrate something thats uniquely me .,art
i did not want to feel a robot. . interesting .,art
thats how i ended up marketing. . you started marketing .,art
what transition from there ?,art
i got to a point where i had to figure out after my degree am i going to try and stay on in sa and build a career because the stream wa there and ive built somewhat built a life there or come back home .,art
and what are my option ?,art
me coming back home i knew i wasnt going to stick with marketing .,art
staying in sa i would have. . but then i listened to my heart a lot .,art
i think my heart told me this is not home .,art
and it is also the the corporate life is the corporate life .,art
i also got to realize that is it boring ?,art
i also got to realize that .,art
i am getting to it. . i got into marketing thinking we are going to be doing creative thing all day making ad learning graphic no no no no no no .,art
you sit in pitch meeting you do administrative work all that is all that is an aspect of it .,art
wonderful a it wa .,art
there a lot of even going through the degree it opened my mind a lot and allowed me to see the possibility .,art
and not in marketing in the business world in general .,art
but then i figured out you can not escape the business .,art
even a an a i realized the amount of work that would have to form a work that need to be done .,art
i said if i am going to do this formal work id rather do it in my own term .,art
it is not boring .,art
but it is not my thing .,art
it is not your thing .,art
very clever .,art
it is not your thing .,art
yeah. . interesting .,art
before you transitioned into something thats more you ?,art
yeah ive had technically five jobs. . all of them in line with marketing .,art
first one wa a small marketing business. . i did a lot of administrative work .,art
and thats the thing for you to climb the rank to get to a point where you are feeling you you can make a choice and have more stuff done on your own term .,art
it is a process .,art
id rather go through that process building my own customized thing .,art
anyway it wa a small deal of administrative work .,art
then i got into the family business ?,art
administrative work .,art
no i went to airtel first. . but yeah i went to airtel .,art
from a small company to a big corporation .,art
then after that i went into a family business .,art
then after that i went into i do not know but yeah something in entertainment .,art
is it three or four ?,art
anyway about there. . now you get to your fourth or fifth job .,art
what wa that one thing that made you realize what ?,art
i am not going to do this anymore .,art
and i am diving into my own thing .,art
wa there a specific incident ?,art
wa there something that triggered that ?,art
i wouldnt say there wa something specific but especially at that time it wa it is that thing where i am ive gotten out of the forest .,art
i am much more clear about what i want where i want to go .,art
even that other job wa a parttime job .,art
and it wa working with airtel and that thing with them .,art
i am this again .,art
this again ?,art
it validated for me that you need to go this path is pretty set .,art
no matter where you go it is pretty set .,art
it cemented for me use this a a springboard for your next job. . interesting .,art
for those who may not know the transition that you have had from your formal training can you speak into what journey you then decided to travel post that ?,art
post what ?,art
post the corporate or the admin .,art
the corporate ha been happening in and out .,art
but then the difficulty with that is that it is not sustainable to be straddling the fence .,art
i would find that for example i wouldnt work towards a promotion because i am anytime now you get then that affect the amount of i guess resource or benefit that you get from doing the stable job .,art
at some point you have to commit to something .,art
it wa always a game of yeah .,art
even the formal job it wa in out i spent a few year working then i go and try my own thing come back to it .,art
and also because i wa very unsure and i am going through life different phase of life where family is why are you doing ?,art
why did you leave that job ?,art
why are you making all up in your face ?,art
and you can not explain the ive got a hunch that something will pop off outside of them .,art
you can not explain that ?,art
it wa difficult .,art
it wa very difficult .,art
the decision to go into what i am doing now specifically did not come at a moment .,art
it is been a buildup .,art
and i do not think it could have been done otherwise because there a lot that i learned from being in formal employment thats helping me now to manage myself when ive been able .,art
and it is not that i did not commit .,art
i wa always committed to making that full time transition .,art
. . it is how the condition needed to align. . . . you say youve been in and out of that space .,art
i want you to speak into the aspect of when you entered the art full time when you were this is something that i want to do now .,art
and i will devote everything that i have .,art
ill devote my energy to making sure that this kick off .,art
what did you start with ?,art
and how did that journey then move on to where you are now ?,art
my first entry into the art wa with dance .,art
and it i made that decision when i wa in my last year of university. . because by that time i had spent about a year and some month almost two year training with a dance crew. . yeah .,art
they they happened upon me one time and then they are you are talented .,art
and thats without going too much into the because that story is a very significant one .,art
it took one person to look me in the eye and say you have something special and it sparked. . i can even to this day i remember that day i can remember where i wa standing it is something sparked in me .,art
and then spending time training with them .,art
i realized these people pay their rent from dance. . they they are building their career .,art
and this is what i wanted .,art
it wa it felt home this is what ive been searching for .,art
when i when i experienced that thats also part of what prompted me to come back home. . because i am here an opportunity .,art
but in my thinking the opportunity are much more vast there do not you think ?,art
but it is not home. . it is not home .,art
and then also i think thats part of my purpose .,art
i love to teach .,art
i am not the type of person whod be guy there a plug this side .,art
i found this. . . . i am not type of person i think .,art
i wa i can go back home and also i am a homebody .,art
i think it is also my personality .,art
by love being able to come back home and spend time and ground myself .,art
thats what i wanted to do .,art
and i took it a an opportunity to say i can take this dance thing that ive learned here and build .,art
and i wa i wa convinced .,art
i do not know how the world works. . i wa i am going to go back to zambia and immediately i am going to hit the ground running and boom we are gone .,art
hey i came back and i saw flame .,art
yeah but i still decided because for me i took it a an opportunity .,art
if there nothing this in zambia let me be the one to bring it .,art
yeah. . that one i committed to that wa my first time i committed this is what i want to do .,art
it wa in the free space .,art
i call these thing i do not call it in the table but it wa a free space where you get to set your your standard and not such a standard but work on your own terms. . yeah .,art
thats what i started with .,art
but the intention wa always to get to dance .,art
dance ha been a thing thats been pulling me it is been my notestar .,art
is it something that you do up loving or is it because of the one interaction you had with with the person you talked about ?,art
the interaction sparked it .,art
but i remember when i wa in high school. . i think i wa depressed .,art
who dumped you ?,art
let not even start talking about thing from high school here because there are people watching .,art
let leave it at that .,art
but i think i wa depressed .,art
i only realized when i introspected and looked at my life but i think i wa depressed .,art
i remember i had a habit of i called i would get into this gray space. . and i think i wa numb to a lot of thing but probably people wouldnt tell .,art
but i think i wa numb and i spent a lot of time in my head and then i would feel i think ive felt let me say i feel numb and what i would do is i would dance in my head .,art
i would i would be this dark space .,art
most of the time i wa in a spotlight and i wa probably wearing white white stuff and i wa dancing and i can not tell you what type of dance i wa doing .,art
but the only thing i can liken it to now when ive known about dance is contemporary dance .,art
and it would be i think what i wa also doing wa meditating and going into that space. . and that helped me a lot .,art
even when i went to uni how i ended up in dance again i listened to my i listened to my intuition a lot. . i would love a lot le than i would love to but i realized i do listen to it a lot .,art
when i went to uni in my second year or i wa the contribution hit me again .,art
but this time i wa aware of it because i wa going through some stuff .,art
and something told me you need to be active .,art
you need to be active .,art
i looked around for different society .,art
i ended up in a cheerleading society that only lasted two week .,art
i ended up in a dance society on campus .,art
and thats where i met an external person who wa looking for dancer for an amateur music video .,art
and boom the rest is history .,art
something kept pushing me go and look for something active to do .,art
and when i started dancing i that feeling came back. . that soothing feeling of when i would be in my head but now i am experiencing it awake .,art
i wa there something here in liberation .,art
there something here .,art
that thats i can not say i had a thing for that .,art
then i met an old i think it wa a primary school schoolmate of mine .,art
that had been seeing me posting dance .,art
. . and they are you were always a dancer .,art
i do not what ?,art
no you remember then i remember that there wa a time i wa choreographing people .,art
and this wa a early a fifth grade .,art
then he started remembering that .,art
then i started remembering this thing ha always been in my life .,art
for me it is more than a super special thing .,art
it is a spiritual thing .,art
nice. . now you talked about how you came back to the nba ?,art
and how in your mind you were look when i go back and do this i am you had it in your mind how the whole thing wa going to play out and how you are going to blow .,art
what happens from there ?,art
i came back and then they were not that but you yeah .,art
and then i tried looking for some and i found one or two .,art
but they were doing something completely different .,art
and it is being exposed to olympic level not olympic level but it wa more advanced ?,art
people are playing that rent .,art
and then you come back here and then it is ground zero .,art
i even thought about going back .,art
it is not too late .,art
but then something ha always been pulling me i said for me it is spiritual .,art
there a lot of my life thats destined to be lived through dance. . and it is also tied to a lot of other people .,art
ive tried even all those nine to five. . thats me trying to get away .,art
but then it pull me back .,art
i came back and then i remember i linked up with a cousin of mine who wa teaching salsa and then thats another thing my brother and my cousin they were into the salsa world because i wa the dance thing that wa biggest .,art
other than rumba and traditional dance i think the salsa wa the salsa latin ballroom type dance were the most common one .,art
i wa let go close enough to this .,art
and then he wa a dj and did wedding choreography .,art
i am close enough .,art
everything that i would end up doing this is close enough .,art
this is close enough .,art
thats how i ended up also joining him .,art
and then i wa id to try out teaching .,art
i think i can teach that .,art
that also prompted me to get my teaching skill and everything is self taught .,art
thats the beauty about the freedom .,art
but it is also the burden at times. . yeah thats i said let me focus on doing this .,art
and also i think because everything wa you can do anything because there nothing .,art
that also gave me some fulfillment .,art
when it wasnt stressing me out .,art
speaking of the mentorship aspect youve talked about how you pretty much went into something without any form of guidance .,art
ha that shaped who you are now ?,art
or do you feel that if you had somebody to pretty much hold your hand thing would have been fast tracked in term of where you would be now .,art
how ha that played out ?,art
having somebody starting out some something without having someone hold your hand .,art
i think ive never been that type of person .,art
and most of my most of my teacher or teaching come out of a challenge you think i can not do it ?,art
i think for me that wasnt an issue .,art
it wa very freeing though there are time where i wa i wish someone could check out me .,art
because then you make mistake .,art
but then it is a learning experience .,art
and then again my ability to say this is an opportunity for me to be that for someone else .,art
even a i am learning i learn to teach .,art
but i also i also feel the spiritual side of thing is in my dna to teach my older brother is a teacher my grandparent were teacher even my dad ha a lot of that teaching thing .,art
even when you talk about the music business even when you bring home cd and whatever and that wa new at the time you are moving from cassette to cd .,art
and then i would be there how doe this work ?,art
ill be confused .,art
i am what is it ?,art
you break it down .,art
i think the teaching thing is in my blood .,art
for me it wa it worked out .,art
it worked out .,art
and you say that wa the introduction to the art .,art
what then did you transition into in term of exploring what is out there within the art industry ?,art
i have to say for me i never looked at it the art .,art
it wa the obvious thing. . it wa it wa the way i and unfortunately i thought everybody lived that .,art
i thought everybody followed their heart .,art
and this is supposed to be though .,art
for me it wasnt it wasnt a focal point .,art
i am going into the art .,art
for me it wa always the feeling .,art
with the even with the fashion thing .,art
i love fashion .,art
and i wa willing to try everything for a long a it felt good .,art
and a long a obviously the condition were thats liberating .,art
i want to speak into film now because you pretty much transitioned from from dance to film .,art
how did that transition come about ?,art
anyway long story short i decided to do a masterclass with kazadi film .,art
i think that wa the first masterclass i think .,art
and then but i went there to try and network .,art
because i my contract wa in renewed in the last job that i wa doing .,art
i wa what am i going to do with my time ?,art
and where am i going next ? .,art
and it wasnt intention .,art
it wasnt intended to transition into something else .,art
it is the stream weve been going on .,art
how can we build on it ?,art
. . for me it wa more about dance .,art
but also i said i do not focus on the art a art and i do not categorize them a dance .,art
for me it is expression .,art
it is the feeling is different plate you use .,art
you use dance you use film you use fashion you use podcast you use public speaking .,art
for me it is one and the same .,art
i wa how can i enrich my journey ?,art
and my intention wa to find something more stable and structured. . i realized i need to network .,art
and also it wa the phase of my life .,art
i wa personal life that i wa in i had hermited for a while. . i wa trying to get myself out of it .,art
let me go to thing that will allow me to meet up because i know with dance people are recording all the time .,art
i wa i wa trying to meet industry people that i can get more access to more structured yeah .,art
that wa my intention .,art
i wa going to network and learn a new skill .,art
heck what what ?,art
that wa my intention .,art
and then lo and behold i got feedback that you are a good actress .,art
again it felt good to me .,art
and i am let me try this .,art
and also ive always had an interest in in acting ?,art
and even in dance there element of that .,art
for me thats what i am saying .,art
it is one in this .,art
it is no distinction because yeah you pretty much .,art
yeah i get your point .,art
you get into this space which is pretty much natural you are saying it is not even a transition from one element to another .,art
do you feel that youve gotten to the point where you are not fulfilled ?,art
no. . but ive gotten to a point where i feel i feel more at peace with even the instability ?,art
of it .,art
i might not be good now but that clarity about who i am what make me at peace is sharper .,art
it is more stable .,art
i am more stable within myself .,art
i wouldnt say and i think fulfillment is eternal .,art
once you are fulfilled in one thing you get unfulfilled with being fulfilled. . and then you want to see whats out there .,art
youve talked about these two element .,art
and my thinking is whenever somebody would want to venture into something that look it is going to bring them fulfillment yet doesnt sit with the general populace .,art
it is something that people usually shelf .,art
they would rather hide .,art
how did you get the courage to get in this place ?,art
i think it come from not to sound esoteric and everything .,art
it come from my blueprint .,art
. . i have always been that person .,art
i wa even saying that kid thats why doe this happen ?,art
. . thats it .,art
anytime someone say you can not do this .,art
i am going to ask why and i am going to figure it out a long a i am interested enough .,art
. . if i am interested enough already by default i am taking it on .,art
i do not even know if the ball come from somewhere .,art
i have them .,art
but thats it that excites me. . to be you think i can not do this .,art
but it is not even a personal thing .,art
it is more i believe thats how everyone should be .,art
and i certainly believe thats how i am .,art
but i am no but you can not tell me that i can not do that .,art
let me show you .,art
but i do not do it for them .,art
it is a personal a personal task that i feel i have to prove to myself and in proving to myself i know other people will see it .,art
and the people that are meant to interact with that engage with that integrate that for themselves who see it .,art
because thats also how it is been done for me seeing other people defy the odds and be different .,art
those are the people that drive me .,art
those are the people that i watch .,art
those are the people that are inspiring to me. . interesting .,art
gwana it is it is yeah ive always told you your journey is very interesting .,art
and and i find it very interesting because it is very unorthodox in term of we have our mind are sent growing up your parent are going to tell you what what career choice they should make .,art
the moment you deviate from that is you are you are you are perceived to be an outcast or theyll look at you in a certain way .,art
did you get that negative vibe from your family or people close to you ?,art
and yes. . yes .,art
but i think what happened and what i usually tell other because i mentor a few dancer .,art
and i have mentored some knowing and unknowingly because also in the dance world another unorthodox an orthodox thing is that a girl your age the style that you are doing shouldnt be doing this .,art
and those who do not conform will stay far enough away from you that they will not engage you .,art
and if they do you will be unmoved if you truly are standing in your truth .,art
eventually it dy down .,art
it is not sustainable when who you are and when you decide .,art
thats it took that to be i do not care .,art
it is a process because there different layer .,art
why do i keep trying to do this thing ?,art
i am sure the investment that you put in it a is it ha to show at some point because it is not only the time it is not only the spiritual connection that you have with it but there also finance involved .,art
because if you have a baby and you want to see something grow out of what you are doing there a lot of stuff that go in it .,art
but i want to also speak into what make somebody successful at what you are doing ?,art
because i do realize that obviously you need to have the formal i do not know if you need to have the formal education because we talked about doing something even without going to school for that .,art
but i want to speak into if somebody is trying to get into this space is there a blueprint that they should follow other than the passion that they have ?,art
i would say the blueprint is know thyself. . thats it .,art
because anything else is not in your control. . if you are going to go and swim where the current is unpredictable creature that you never could have imagined or dreamed of would come at you then the only thing you can bank on is you .,art
through whatever phase you are of the journey you always the only grounding thing the only stable thing the only thing you can rely on is you .,art
and you will not always know you .,art
it is up and down .,art
you feel i know me tomorrow something happens .,art
they are wait wa that me ? .,art
but that should always be your north star .,art
that should always be your blueprint .,art
doe this when i put me and what i know about me far gap and everything shadow badsided everything you have to also be real with yourself .,art
when i put it over this thing is it aligned ?,art
for me the alignment ha always come with ha always been confirmed with the feeling .,art
it used to be ridiculous .,art
i couldnt even say to people but now i say it proudly because thats the one thing that ha helped me .,art
how doe this feel ?,art
thats it .,art
how doe this feel ?,art
and then that informs everything whether it is a logical decision whether it is an emotional decision and you learn because thats how life is .,art
i do not think there a blueprint for life .,art
there definitely no blueprint .,art
even if you were in accounting there no guarantee that it is going to work out exactly a the conventional blueprint lay it out .,art
speaking into zambia and where we are currently in term of maturity how at what level do you think we are at in term of the art ?,art
i think it is growing .,art
i think it is growing for me .,art
if i focus on the dance community or industry definitely where it is at now is where i thought it wa when i came fresh from uni .,art
and i am this is where we are going .,art
for me it is bittersweet a that this is where it is now but everything happens a it should for a reason .,art
with that i feel everything ha it own journey .,art
i do not try to attach to the idea of it is supposed to be .,art
because if it wa supposed to be it is whats happening .,art
if it is happening thats what it is supposed to be .,art
and it is for a reason .,art
you need to find whats your place in that ?,art
how are you interacting with what is going on now ?,art
doe it frustrate you that the maturity level in the industry are not where they are supposed to be ?,art
and doe that sometimes make you feel what ?,art
is this even worth doing ?,art
because in my mind my vision is we should be .,art
i know youve talked about appreciating where you currently are .,art
i am not thinking much where we should be .,art
but if youve got a conception in your mind it is probably frustrating if it is taking age to get to where you are supposed to be .,art
doe that frustrate you ?,art
back to what i said .,art
i do not believe in supposed to be .,art
yes ill have my idea and my ideal .,art
because it is also about perspective .,art
for some people who had a different experience let say ill use dance a a reference who had a different experience to mine .,art
where it is now is my god and thats their experience .,art
where is it ?,art
maybe i need to understand where it is now .,art
where is it ?,art
it is where it is supposed to be .,art
but no i want to answer your question .,art
it is a moment type of thing .,art
and there are time where it is great .,art
for me i think my default when i am struck now ive learned something ive learned my default .,art
and i am struggling with something when i am feeling i am forcing why i want i where i want to be and all of that .,art
i am what do i need to know from now ?,art
because when you figure out now the closer you are the faster you get to where you think you are supposed to be .,art
for me i think that that i call it the conversion rate ?,art
of realizing that ha become shorter and shorter and shorter .,art
i do not to stress about thing that are there to stress especially when there are other thing that i can choose to focus on that i have better use of my energy .,art
the perception out there is this specific area dance is pretty much very young in our in our context or in our setup in zambia .,art
it is very very young .,art
and you will make money out of it .,art
people shy away from it not because they are not passionate about it but because they feel it is not sustainable .,art
can you speak into that ?,art
is it an area that would bring satisfaction both in term of what you are passionate about a a something that is sustainable for you ?,art
thats a heavy question because i am now thinking back to all the different answer i have for that depending on where i am .,art
but for now i think it come down to even i think what i would have wanted to say the previous question is that you determine what success is to you .,art
for a lot of people and it is normal ive been through that phase a where success is resource finance these world standard .,art
but you got ta eat you got ta be on that .,art
you make decision and you live with them and you live with the consequence and you learn and you move .,art
i think ... my question is is this decision paying off ?,art
honestly no .,art
but also at a certain point i decided to not do dance for commercial purpose .,art
and that wa intentional .,art
for some people because they are a measure of success is how commercially profitable something is .,art
they will go for that and they will pursue that .,art
but i reached a fork in the road i guess where i had to decide do i go the commercial route or do i focus on a different way ?,art
of course with my track record i focus on a different way .,art
not that i do not want to make money out of it but how i make money is very important to me. . and if i am not making money in a way that feel good to me ultimately it even affect my work .,art
yeah thats very ethical of you to stick to the part that you feel is insane .,art
look you speak about how at the moment this is something that is not bringing in the amount of finance you would want .,art
whats your motivation to keep going ?,art
because i know what i am building .,art
and i am playing the long game .,art
there a guy called gary vee gary vaynerchuk .,art
i used to listen to his stuff a lot .,art
ive listened that i do not necessarily need to listen to new stuff because his message is the same .,art
and from him i got validation about or clarity about why i operate the way i do .,art
i am a long game type of person .,art
i find comfort in that .,art
i said that wa mentioned off camera but i love process. . even the commercial thing it became i am sure you heard of maybe even let say what example can i give ?,art
maybe sport when they focus too much on the commercial it affect their ability to deliver in the actual technical side of the game and what the game is about .,art
i started experiencing that .,art
and i realized that i am not a i am not the type of person that can sustainably do that for a long period of time .,art
i love the process .,art
i love the self discovery that happens .,art
when you are checking out stuff for number for money for me it get old quick .,art
and it negatively affect me. . yeah .,art
and i think it doesnt align with my purpose for an extended period of time .,art
and it is not my thing .,art
thats real .,art
thats real .,art
ive always played the long game .,art
even now i know and thats where even the the time spent in company because company do not i worked in airtel .,art
airtel did not register today and all of a sudden it is a big a it is. . ive learned even seeing my dad build this company from where it wa it is no longer existing now but it is it wa successfully existing for twenty five year .,art
. . twenty five year is a long time .,art
ive only been doing dance officially for fifteen years. . yeah .,art
i know i i know where i laid the brick .,art
i know the foundation and the intention wa always to get to the long game .,art
i know it touched on it a bit .,art
tell u about your journey in film .,art
my journey in film did i mention the masterclass ?,art
after i did the masterclass i wa i think let me try and do this .,art
ive always been working towards that and depending on the opportunity that come i push in one direction .,art
a lot of the music you sing ?,art
let me put it out there .,art
i hesitate because there always this standard .,art
if you sing then theyll ask you to sing and then i i i can sing and also i am someone who belief i can do anything .,art
thats what even got me with dance .,art
i am i can see that i am a human being .,art
ive got limb and i understand enough .,art
i can do that .,art
i can if it take me ten year if i want it enough i can do it .,art
even with singing .,art
and you have perfected your craft .,art
i when i see the clip of you dancing i am how doe she even do that ? ?,art
for me my attitude especially with my older year in fact it is been throughout you can do anything .,art
it is how long are you willing to take to get there ?,art
. . and even are you willing to take the risk of not getting there but knowing that you going through that process is going to sprout many other thing that you even have no idea .,art
you might find yourself on the moon .,art
you started through singing then you meet elon musk or whatever .,art
i do not know but it is something i am a person that belief in that .,art
i do not have the greatest voice .,art
i am not with houston but i can sing .,art
ive tried out some people have heard me whether they were lying or not down for it but i am going with it .,art
is this something that you want to explore ?,art
yeah i have started .,art
ive talked to a few people .,art
you were collab .,art
i am not yet at freestyle level but i write. . yeah .,art
even with singing i write .,art
ive written a few song .,art
we are not going to play them today .,art
that transition is very interesting .,art
you get into film after the masterclass and everything you when did you then realize that i can do this .,art
it happened to be honest .,art
it happened .,art
most thing i set an intention in internally this is what i want to do .,art
it would be nice .,art
i wonder and then my energy go towards that direction .,art
and when an opportunity come i gravitate towards it .,art
also depending on how excited i am by it i am i think there something here .,art
ill move maybe faster towards more intentionally towards it .,art
even with film i went to masterclass and then it wa it is something you can do .,art
i started going back to thing that i used to do before where i would when i watch a movie i would sit and i think what would it take for me to pull off this character a authentically a this person ?,art
i wouldnt think what would it take to act ?,art
for me it wa what would it feel ?,art
what would how would they do it ? .,art
and i would try it out .,art
and it would come out of interest of whatever character or the movie or the story .,art
thats where it came from .,art
now when i am i think i can someone ha confirmed for me because when you are doing it by yourself you are am i maybe i am guessing myself ?,art
and when it wa confirmed for me then i am i think let try this more intentionally .,art
now i start going on youtube bless youtube the university of youtube .,art
and i am looking at stuff and trying out different thing .,art
and also even realizing in the masterclass i wasnt completely lost because of dance again editing my own video and what i understood thing color grading and that i might not know them on a professional app but i know them on on capcats or whatever .,art
i understand the basic enough that i can even see i am more interested in this and le of this and but i wa generally interested in everything .,art
from then for a few month i gave it maybe even a month i gave it a try i looking for i did not even look for edition it started popping up .,art
and the beauty of social medium is that when you search something for example on youtube now all of a sudden there a connection or something pop up on your facebook or whatever .,art
yeah i started seeing thing and started following them up .,art
and i did not even do that many .,art
and thats where the spiritual side of thing come here .,art
when you are good with yourself what you need come to you without fighting for it .,art
i did an online audition for something .,art
and then i even missed the deadline .,art
i know my video wa bad but i pushed myself to finally do it .,art
and i wa struggling with a lot of thing why do you always it wa but then what ive learned about such moment in my life is there always something .,art
i did not go through but i wa also very open minded .,art
and it wa it is anyway i ended up in a group chat where there a lot of actor or whatever .,art
it kept that interest alive .,art
and then all of a sudden an all the pointer of mine that i met through dance and hadnt seen for ten year met them at the master class .,art
and then they were both surprised dancer .,art
what are you doing here ?,art
and then he wa no i am into film and i work for a production company and i am a writer and all that .,art
and then sound cool .,art
this seems interesting .,art
if you have any project whatever it doesnt even have to be acting i can come and intern for you or whatever that thing .,art
let me know .,art
putting myself out there .,art
remember i said that that period of time i wa intentionally trying to get out more .,art
i think maybe three no in fact a year a whole almost a whole year past .,art
and then he called me up and he hey there this audition .,art
you should go through that .,art
and thats how i went through and got the part .,art
and now i am in a series tv series .,art
you are you are you are practically doing something that is airing ?,art
the tv series is on zambezi magic. . it is called chocolo .,art
it is a local production. . and it air every monday tuesday wednesday .,art
thats huge .,art
thats huge .,art
first time on set .,art
no those are big move .,art
those are big move .,art
and yeah i can already see where this is going .,art
i do realize that having such a routine can be strenuous .,art
it can be stressful .,art
how do you keep yourself sane in such an environment and with everything that that you do ? .,art
it is true .,art
it is true .,art
it is let me not sit up here .,art
i do not because thats one reason why i documented my dance journey a lot .,art
and i started free styling because that wa a whole everything i do ha a deeper story behind it .,art
when i started documenting and it is something ive also always had i think from childhood ive always seen what i do a a message. . even if i am doing it for me i know it is a message .,art
i know it is hitting someone somewhere .,art
i always project this thing that i am doing .,art
what level of clarity do i have about how i am going to explain it when i am sitting before it be when i am sitting with oprah doing my interview ?,art
when i made the decision to document it wa i do not want people it will be hard for me to say remember that time when i want to reference this is what wa going on .,art
and then you can see the .,art
you can even see the progression .,art
now remind me there wa a reason i went there .,art
it wa how do you maintain the sanity ?,art
it is trial and error .,art
and also everything i do is personal to me .,art
there always a story there .,art
even in the time where now it is easy to say i did this and this but no it wa going with whats happening at the time and trying to survive it .,art
now it is even hard for me to talk about let say the struggle .,art
i know you even mentioned about the struggle with family and whatever it is a very real thing .,art
it is a very real thing .,art
and it is not easy by any mean .,art
and you have to make choice and sacrifice .,art
you have to be able to live with it .,art
and thats why i go back to saying when yourself what you are able to deal with .,art
other people can deal with at my age not being married .,art
other people can deal with not having kid .,art
other people can deal with the pressure of their family saying yo why are not you married ?,art
i want to be married i think .,art
but yeah those are sound the huge sacrifice in term of whats conventional .,art
but to me because of what i am getting out of it it balance out .,art
not that it doesnt irk me or it doesnt frustrate me .,art
no but the other thing that i get from doing thing the way ive done that are fulfilling to me .,art
it balance out .,art
and it will happen when it will happen .,art
if it is meant to happen. . we are wrapping up our conversation now ghana .,art
but id to hear from you how what advice you would give to somebody who want to be liberated you .,art
yeah this following a path and much identifying that opportunity are there .,art
what mindset should they have ?,art
and what guidance would you give them ?,art
i think first of all i would say define for yourself what liberation is to you. . because this for me it is for some people what i am doing is radical. . they do not get it .,art
and they would definitely wouldnt dare do it .,art
for some people they see certain thing and they think thats cool .,art
and i want to do it too .,art
maybe they are very few though .,art
on the surface i understand it can look a certain way but you do not know the number of time that ive been i think i messed up .,art
but this is not for me .,art
know what liberation is for you .,art
and it doesnt have to look anybody el .,art
and sometimes even when it doe you still have to deal with you .,art
be real with yourself and and strive to know yourself truly know yourself .,art
and even i can not i am not sitting here claiming that i know myself .,art
i am much more comfortable with where i am and who i am now .,art
and i think that also come with age but also what you do with your age is important .,art
yeah i think thats know know what you know who you are and accept who you are for a long a it give you peace .,art
because even when i say i want to say feel good but feel good can often be miscontrude to only mean good feeling .,art
no i even know but when i am when i am being unreasonable this is how i am .,art
and also it is a selfawareness that how other people receive you because you always have an explanation for but it is because you pissed me off .,art
thats why .,art
but to someone else it is a different thing .,art
yeah it is a process of knowing yourself and use your intuition .,art
you are where you are .,art
you think what you think you say what you say you do what you do for a reason. . and the more clear you are about that i think the easiest to navigate life .,art
what next fonguana ?,art
have you set out a strategy for yourself ?,art
yes but i am not about to tell you because well be here for another three hour .,art
but yeah i mentioned i am now we finished shooting for the season two of chocolo .,art
and now i want to develop a much skill a i can and fast track my progression and my growth .,art
yeah because even being on set i learned much and i am still eager to learn .,art
i want to do that now .,art
thank you much for coming through to the talent plug podcast .,art

ऄह जय त ग same enemy champion same enemy trash 축 combat subdivision my life in wa construction i lost my job got my job parasite ? ?,art

yeah if you have any question for future qas drop them in the comment and well try to include them in future interview .,art
with that said do you have any question ?,art
i butchered the story but you get the point .,art
i guess the question is how can you build that nonattachment to thing and people and stuff that happen throughout the day that that meditation or whenever we have time to meditate that meditation is taken care of the real stuff .,art
welcome back to the honest art podcast today .,art
i want you to know that i have been deliberating on whether to do this podcast for for quite a while about a year .,art
and finally i decided that it wa time to talk about it .,art
and if you look at the title of the podcast you can see that it is probably something that we are going to weed a lot of men out because of the title on podcast .,art
if you are a man and you are still listening to this i want to bow and i appreciate you doing .,art
if you have a partner though that is a woman and shes a creative you might want to stick around and listen to this because i do think it is important .,art
what we are going to be talking about obviously is the menopause ?,art
and in particular my menopausal journey and what happened if anything youll know what it wa but what happened to my creative practice a i started going through this huge change in my life because ill admit that it hasnt been fun that the process ha not been great .,art
but on the other side it ha caused some great thing to happen for me my creative process and for my art .,art
let me share all of the deed with you .,art
are you ready ?,art
first of all i want to be honest .,art
and i know this is embarrassing to admit but i want to tell you i truly did not think that the menopause train wa going to stop at my house .,art
now i know that it affect one hundred of woman if we have the pleasure the honor of living long enough for it to happen .,art
but i did not think it wa going to happen to me full stop .,art
that happens to other woman not much to me .,art
but here why .,art
i wa raised by three generation of woman before me .,art
not only wa there my mother but there wa my grandmother and my great grandmother .,art
and when i say my great grandmother i am not talking i knew her and she wa in a nursing home .,art
this woman made me gumbo almost every day .,art
i woke up in the morning a she wa there .,art
when i say three generation of woman i mean three generation of woman .,art
thats how much either any any of them talked about menopause any of them not one .,art
there wa not one talk of a hot flash .,art
there wa not one talk of brain fog .,art
there wa not one talk of dry anything .,art
none of them talked about it never heard a word .,art
of course i thought i come from that special family where we were not affected by menopause .,art
and then all of a sudden not all of a sudden it started happening in my four day .,art
i started having hot flash ?,art
and i thought thats a hot flash .,art
i did not i did not attach it to anything big menopause. ?,art
it wa hot flash ?,art
but then the last couple of year i started having all of these other symptom i could not concentrate .,art
and it wa even to the point when i have a fantastic amazing team of woman around me .,art
and they are top of the line top of their field .,art
they are incredible .,art
but when wed be having our team call and i did not want them to realize i did not want them to know that i wa having such a hard time remembering what they were saying and the brain fog wa that bad .,art
and on top of that i wa cry on and off throughout the day .,art
now i do not mind being emotional .,art
i i embraced if i think something is moving i am going to cry about it .,art
i am going to let all of that flow .,art
but yall it is i remember one time i wa talking to i wa writing a book the book wa finished and i wa trying to decide whether i wa going to go with publisher or not .,art
and i had a friend who wanted me to meet with somebody who wa in the publishing world .,art
and i started talking about the book and i started cry a i wa and i thought what is wrong with me ?,art
throughout the day i would randomly start cry and thing that wouldnt normally get to me that much .,art
i wa intermittently cry on and off throughout the day which tell me that my brain chemistry wa off ?,art
it meant that i wa when you get down to it i wa cycling through period of anxiety and depression .,art
and there look at this up .,art
there have been many study that show that the highest rate of diagnosed depression by psychologist and doctor is they and the highest number of prescription written are woman in their fifty and menopause .,art
it is not that we are depressed .,art
we are not clinically depressed .,art
we are fucking in menopause people .,art
and i did not know that ?,art
but none of that none of the fact that my eye when i would wake up in the morning they would stick together my all of the thing in my body that needed moisture were drying up all of that .,art
none of that did the trick for me to finally go to my doctor and say my god something is wrong .,art
it wa it wa the fact that i wasnt sleeping .,art
and it i had not had a great night sleep and i can not tell you how long .,art
all of these thing started happening to me .,art
and you guy know we are not robot ?,art
and the fact that i wa had much brain fog i wasnt sleeping .,art
i wa starting to fall asleep on the regular .,art
if i sat still long enough i would fall asleep at two in the afternoon three in the afternoon .,art
and the exhaustion that i can not drag my as off the sofa .,art
and i am not a napper .,art
nothing say i do not feel sexy anymore .,art
your hair falling out. . all of these thing started happening which led me to finally going to my gynecologist and saying i need support .,art
now i am telling you guy this now because i am going to tell you what i did but i am not a doctor .,art
i know there a lot of different idea out there .,art
there a lot of helpful thing .,art
you have to decide whats for you .,art
i am going to tell you what i did but do not you dm me .,art
do not come for me in any i am not telling you what i am doing is for you .,art
for me what wa for me wa hormone replacement therapy .,art
i do not have a lot of the risk factor and everything but anyway hormone replacement therapy .,art
you guy within two night of taking progesterone your girl wa sleeping .,art
i hadnt slept through the night in maybe a decade .,art
it had been year since i had slept through the night .,art
i got on hrt progesterone finally got on estrogen and there go the hot flash sleeping through the night .,art
no hot flash but it wasnt that that i did .,art
i also i also went on these supplement that absolutely changed my life .,art
and if you are part of my patreon community if you are a patron from patreon i am going to share on there what all of the supplement that i am doing because i feel i am thirty five again .,art
and my when friend see me they are that havent seen me in a year .,art
they are what are you doing ?,art
whats your secret ?,art
all of that .,art
and on patreon i am sharing all of those thing .,art
but we head over to that .,art
but all i am want you to get from this is i first i did not know this this wa coming .,art
second i wa in the middle of it deeply that i did not even know what it wa .,art
i couldnt crawl out of it .,art
and then finally i wa i can not take this anymore .,art
and i reached out for help to my gynecologist .,art
and there are many resource out there .,art
again ill list some more of these in patreon .,art
but anyway that that part sucked .,art
but i will tell you there were in term of my art there were some benefit of menopause that you couldnt have told me ahead of time .,art
i think it is impacted my work .,art
the first thing now that i know now that i feel good again this is important the first thing that i will say now that i feel good again is that i have run out of fuck to give .,art
and that change and affect your art .,art
when you do not care who see it you do not care what they are going to say it is creativity for the sake of fun and play and enjoying yourself .,art
that is what this time in my life and this menopausal journey ha given me .,art
you you do not you do not you run out of fuck and it is beautiful .,art
and a a result of that and seeing the response to my work and what i am doing to the response to what i am saying on social medium what i am saying to my if you are part of patreon or my email list ?,art
what i am saying because the response ha been good now i am learning to trust myself more .,art
imagine what trusting myself ha done for my art .,art
it mean that i i self edit a lot le .,art
i can not say i am completely free of it .,art
but when i start to second guess myself and my judgment ill be no hold up hold up and ill trust myself to continue to move forward .,art
that is huge when it come to our creativity .,art
and then additionally it ha made me more curious it is made me le apprehensive to explore a different area .,art
maybe it is exploring a new tool exploring a new modality .,art
maybe it is ordering those those new supply from amazon .,art
i am leaning into my curiosity and exploring that in a way that honestly i can not say i have done in other time in my creative career .,art
and the only way i can the only thing i can attach that to is i am in that phase of my life and it is it is completely freeing .,art
it is beautiful .,art
because of that it is it is a self exploration for myself a self exploration of what do what do i want to put on the campus ?,art
and that part of that if giving fewer fox the self exploration the the beautiful freedom of putting whatever i want on the canvas without fear of judgment from other people that ha made me much more confident a an artist .,art
while the majority of the experience sucked ?,art
i did not even go into how my joint ached .,art
while the majority of that sucked when i wa in the middle of it the the fact that i i did not sit back and go thats my lot in life .,art
guess it is going to die slowly now. . and the fact that i did not do that i wa no hold up hold up .,art
because i did not have three generation ahead of me talking about this doesnt mean that i have to accept this a my new reality .,art
i am not that person .,art
i am glad that i acknowledged this time in my life .,art
i am glad that i explored what option were available to me but i also am excited and i am happy that i have gone through this because it ha impacted my art and it ha impacted who i believe and know i am a an artist .,art
this is coming for all of u lady .,art
maybe you are already past it .,art
maybe it is going to be coming for you .,art
maybe you are in the middle of it .,art

please tell me a bit about yourself and how you got started a an animal painting artist and tell me a bit about your medium a . my name is annalise .,art
i am based in australia this is fun having two different time zone .,art
i started painting pet during lockdown .,art
good old covid lockdown i think .,art
i am not sure what happened in the uk but we had about a couple of year of lockdown .,art
i do not know if i it .,art
it is hectic .,art
and everyone loved their pet and my neighbour down the street were doing a paint off .,art
she wa doing watercolor powsers and putting them in people letter box .,art
and weve got a lot of pet in our street .,art
i thought i am going to paint pet .,art
i started to paint people pet for fun .,art
and then my sister suggested i start up an instagram account .,art
and then kept on posting .,art
and now it is my fulltime job you .,art
it is fun .,art
what did you used to do before ?,art
i have a bachelor of food and nutrition science which i never used .,art
it is always fun .,art
and then these day i paint i now do event managing .,art
and then run my own market still selling cute card and all of that which yeah it is amazing how going into uni thinking one thing and then coming here and doing something completely different .,art
yes i wanted to ask you why watercolor .,art
thats my simple thing .,art
my mom an art teacher .,art
ive heard art around me and we got the beautiful cuy nor pallet which these are the original one that i started painting pet with .,art
and then yeah i i love the flow .,art
i love the ability to build which i guess you get from pencil .,art
and i see a lot of people doing pencil .,art
i thought why not watercolor ?,art
yes definitely .,art
i find watercolor impossible .,art
i can not get my head around it .,art
i am interested to understand your process and what you do .,art
what are you doing now ?,art
now no this is a huge i compared to what i normally paint .,art
this is fun .,art
i with eye normally i start with the base color which i can see that youll be doing with the past making sure because the eye are much different for the fur .,art
where i paint each hair one by one without a base layer .,art
without a base layer .,art
thats one that ive been working on .,art
it is beautiful .,art
each hair one by one .,art
driving me mental but i would not do anything else .,art
sometimes i am guessing you get the point where when you do a portrait you are it is going through the ugly stage you need to start over and then you push through it and you are .,art
yeah i feel you get that a lot with watercolor .,art
especially you guy have rubber .,art
ive had to use a couple of the rubbing out technique when my cat decided to join in a watercolor portrait .,art
he wa tiny and he decided that he wanted to get in .,art
id freshly made some paint for myself and he stepped in it and it is a beautiful red pigment which i might use a burnt umber and he stepped all over the portrait .,art
no in red .,art
in red .,art
it wa it killed me .,art
did you have to start again ?,art
i wa able to .,art
there this technique where you flood it with water. . and then you can lift it with qtips .,art
which sound interesting .,art
which wa painful because red pigment i am guessing you get it with the color the pencil .,art
red pigment have that little bit stronger staining ability .,art
even though it is one of the first color to bleach .,art
i messaged the customer on my home .,art
and they all i did not notice it .,art
it is a challenge if you did the mistake or let say something .,art
it is .,art
thats for nothing .,art
i do not know who ha sleepless stressful time when you are yeah i can not see it .,art
no i feel that sometimes a when ive done a commission or something .,art
and i feel i normally only send it out if i am one hundred happy with it .,art
but there are some niggling thing should i work on it a bit longer ?,art
or should i have stopped several layer ago or that thing .,art
and then you send it i always send a picture to the client first they can approve it before i send it to them .,art
and it is when they say it is fantastic .,art
you are thank goodness .,art
weight off my shoulder .,art
thats i am pleased .,art
i had that it is normally the one with time crunch to me .,art
i need it for this day. . . . and then the more you paint whats happening do i start over ?,art
this is not my goodness i can go bumping this .,art
it is all .,art
i get all the time day .,art
it is always the one with time crunch that always you are my goodness .,art
this is not working .,art
the pencil are not deciding to pencil .,art
but for me my brush have decided to go in retirement .,art
and then they are my god it is perfect .,art
it is i am glad you did not see the stress behind it .,art
thats a thing because nowadays you have to record all of your artwork .,art
instead of take a picture at nice stage .,art
and i feel it add to the stress somehow .,art
that you have to make sure that you have time to stop tape photo tape footage .,art
then do it and then .,art
you get in with the flow and stuff and it wa much easier in the day .,art
it wa easier in the day where you could leave a camera on and do a time lapse .,art
because then you can forget about the camera and leave it running a you are drawing and painting .,art
and people would find that interesting .,art
but now people are i am done with that .,art
what else ?,art
but i liked doing that .,art
it is interesting .,art
let see what people on social medium .,art
and i had one viral video of my brush and then post a video finishing a portrait .,art
and it is a couple of thousand. . it is a weird world now trying to get out there .,art
yes definitely tricky .,art
it is why it is good to try and not rely i think on social medium to make your money .,art
it is more of a way of being out there and showing what you are doing .,art
but you are not relying on it for gaining client .,art
because i think it is with the algorithm it can be very unpredictable .,art
it is .,art
when did you start doing pet portrait and all that ?,art
it wa eight year ago now .,art
eight year ago .,art
there proof in the pudding .,art
but yeah you thought we would have seen all the different change the different trend .,art
yeah definitely .,art
because i remember when i first because i used to do video quite a lot of i called them finishing touch video .,art
and it wa when you are putting the finishing whisker or something on it .,art
and those did on facebook .,art
and now people seem to hate video on facebook .,art
they do on my page anyway .,art
i get no comment or anything .,art
but they love picture .,art
it is trying to understand what platform people certain thing .,art
and it can change .,art
you need to keep that in mind when you are doing it .,art
i these day i am i am not it sound weird .,art
i am not creating content for others .,art
i am creating the content for me .,art
the way that i see this my instagram is a portfolio. . yeah .,art
and almost i have a mentor and she said to me present your instagram a it is a dinner party and you are inviting guest to it .,art
what are they going to see ?,art
and yeah i need to show my customer the real me because thats who they are going to be talking to .,art
and yeah exactly .,art
why pretend to be someone else when i want to attract the same people with the same energy that i have ?,art
it is no thats good .,art
thats a good way of seeing it .,art
how am i going to attract those people ?,art
because it is easy to get sucked in is not it ?,art
and feel because i definitely do that sometimes a . it is but ive got all these follower and they are not seeing it .,art
and you can get frustrated and why is not it working ?,art
and then one day it doe work .,art
and you are thats how you do it .,art
and then you try again the next day is and it doesnt work .,art
it is give me give me something please .,art
god i thought i nailed this .,art
yeah i got the viral video .,art
let let do another one. . that video .,art
it is even a wish to talk .,art
i feel you have to use social medium what it is for which is to be social .,art
what we are doing now we are using it to have a live and a chat and hang out .,art
and i think thats what you need to use social medium for is networking and chatting to people and being social .,art
and thats i think thats the one good thing about social medium is that we can now you are in the uk .,art
back then it would have been pigeon .,art
i am up to this bit on the eyeball .,art
i am up to this bit .,art
thats how i am done now .,art
i wa done month ago .,art
here the photo of the pigeon .,art
they are funny .,art
do you find watercolour to be quite a fast medium then ?,art
i find it quite slow .,art
i am guessing that you get it the same .,art
there much to build upon .,art
all the layer is not it ?,art
it is and it is the layer you can not fast track .,art
and looking at this eye i am my goodness there all these different yellow .,art
all these different variation of yellow .,art
i feel it is harder for you watercolour because it dry a different colour .,art
then you put it on no ?,art
how do what colour you are using ?,art
thats what i want to know .,art
please tell me .,art
i had that thought the other day of quickly show my palette .,art
thats what my palette look .,art
and i think thats what i love about it .,art
it is nine.18pm in australia .,art
i got my cup of tea .,art
i used to paint this late when i wa working and painting .,art
now ive got the luxury of not painting earlier .,art
painting earlier .,art
i think how many of u are artist ?,art
theyll be yeah .,art
sometimes i paint or pack order in pyjama .,art
i am guilty of that .,art
you can do that when you work from home can not you ?,art
it can .,art
but sometimes it surprise me when ive got a customer picking up their order and i forget and i am in my pyjama .,art
but then also thats me .,art
i am honestly impressed with these book that you created .,art
my grandfather came over and i showed him look what ive got .,art
i am excited for this .,art
and he but why did you get it on my ... it is my own personal development thing .,art
one hundred will be using and practicing a lot the poodle .,art
i do not know about you but i hate curly hair dog .,art
it is definitely a tactic to it .,art
and i do not get them enough that it is i said i probably will have a whole lot now .,art
i do not get a lot in a row for it to be in my brain .,art
and then the moment i get it i am here i remember this .,art
and then it is almost retraining yourself .,art
youve got one in here and it is a red the red poodle i want to say .,art
i am glad that nobody asked to do that live yet .,art
ill be watching that live when you do it .,art
i might turn that one into a tutorial .,art
i think that would be better .,art
you can be i am doing this over a couple of day .,art
do you have ... they havent been taking me too long .,art
theyve been all about id say up to two hour maximum for these. . and i guess it also depends on what detail you want to focus on .,art
me and brian are focusing on the eye and the vein while you are going more for the hair. . every now and then i look up and i am you are up to this .,art
no ive honestly been using this book myself a a way of getting quicker because now that i have a kid i do not have a much time a i used to .,art
i want to be a good but quickly. ?,art
thats what ive been mainly using this book for .,art
i love that .,art
and when you suggested to me using the paper rather than going straight on it thats going to be helpful when they are today .,art
i need to practice those curl again .,art
i need to practice those curl and even practicing in different color .,art
do you have a ... yeah definitely .,art
read or love anything that you love when you get a lover .,art
i have a breed that i owe .,art
i do not know .,art
no it is i small that i the problem i have is that i a challenge .,art
the more complicated it is the more i it .,art
thats my issue .,art
give me ten multicolored poodle .,art
i will be very excited .,art
thats thats what i quite i also it when i get a customer ask me to do a drawing from several reference photo and add them all together and they do not even have the reference photo that they want .,art
i feel thats a cool challenge because it give me a bit of i guess artistic license to come up with a nice composition for them using their picture .,art
and it is a little bit more exciting than being a photocopier .,art
i do prefer the more complicated stuff .,art
i love them .,art
everyone asks me do you must hate painting white pit ?,art
and i love painting white pit .,art
it is the black .,art
it is black that challenge me. ?,art
i feel black is much easier .,art
why do you struggle with black ?,art
there many variation about ill show you on my palette that i made here on the black .,art
to me this is blue black when i need it to be brown black .,art
it is it is a interesting thing .,art
and black is hard to layer up because then it start getting pasty .,art
versus white .,art
i am using wash of wash of color where yeah sometimes it is a green wash. if it is you can clearly see the dog being in grass or mulled teaser where theyve got that true red wash around their mouth .,art
yeah i i love painting white pit because you get a little bit more freedom i guess with the watercolor .,art
do you use the paper a lot with white pit then and have the paper a the color ?,art
or do you cover the whole paper still ?,art
i do use the the paper a lot .,art
i am trying to think yeah use the paper .,art
but a lot of the time it will be the backing almost how you do the pastel .,art
and then build up on it .,art
lot of gray although i still use white watercolor thats still not the white .,art
for my card series i painted a japanese spitz and a white a white cat .,art
and that wa fun .,art
it wa different white .,art
it wa i love those .,art
i am also excited in your book there fish .,art
there fish .,art
there fish .,art
are you going to try that next then ?,art
i have painted a fish .,art
and do i have them with me ?,art
you would this is one thing that i do not think you can get your pencil .,art
ive got these beautiful handmade wow .,art
shimmer watercolor .,art
and this is why i wish i do watercolor .,art
and these one are multicone .,art
what brand are those ?,art
these are handmade .,art
they are called shimmer drop .,art
shes based in based in australia .,art
thats funny .,art
they are all handmade .,art
they are nice .,art
and they smell clove because shes the preservative in it .,art
thats what i am excited to do with the fish and add those tiny little detail that will ... hello that would look amazing .,art
yeah thats going to look amazing .,art
and then you want to do watercolor .,art
i would to try but i am also very scared .,art
do not be silly .,art
it is honestly much fun .,art
i think it is letting the brush do and not fight .,art
thats one thing .,art
do not be frightened. . not a lot of water .,art
i do not use a lot of water. . half the time ive got a tissue near me and i dab it off or youll always hear me wiping against my jar .,art
it doesnt bleed too much or something .,art
then i can have more control because i think thats one thing .,art
i see a lot of watercolor artist and they do big wash and the wash are watery. . and then they paint on top of that and thats when you do not have the control over the paint .,art
and thats when it start to go .,art
i could probably use that technique here .,art
it you flood it a bit .,art
and then add the paint and you can see how the paint go on it own little writing and then it creates those harsh border sometimes .,art
it is a interesting thing .,art
i feel pencil or my my thought of pencil .,art
i get annoyed at the pencil not being sharp enough all the time. ?,art
and you should not should get one of these .,art
i love this sharpener much .,art
it is a heavy brass sharpener and it is it is fantastic .,art
i use it all the time .,art
ive got my little tabletop bin and sharpen it in there. . yeah .,art
i havent emptied it in the two year that ive been using it .,art
youve got my little in the key .,art
i feel when you fill that up you need to put resin in it .,art
it look a little in there .,art
a trophy of your ear sharpening .,art
but i think it is good for how much you havent sharpened .,art
i guess because i use ive got every pencil .,art
i go through them and i do not need to sharpen them that often i guess because i use many i keep switching much .,art
and also it is not normally a couple of turn anyway .,art
because you constantly are using it .,art
have you found it a color that you havent matched ?,art
or have you been able to match about every single color or blend ?,art
there are some thing that you get with i do not know maybe tabby cat .,art
theyve got this brown ochery greeny color that can be quite hard to match .,art
but then i have found i think this is quite a good color for it .,art
it is called earth green .,art
and this is such a good undertone for stuff .,art
but you wouldnt necessarily know unless you try them all out .,art
and then karen dash came out with a new color a couple of year ago called what is this ?,art
middle the third third digress .,art
i can not believe that .,art
and this ha been useful .,art
ive been using it quite a lot .,art
it is getting shorter and shorter. . i that the nice nail color for you .,art
this is lovely .,art
ive been using this quite a lot a . i do not know .,art
i also think that sometimes if it is not exactly the color in the picture thats .,art
because it is your interpretation .,art
because again we are not photocopier .,art
we are artist .,art
we are trying to get the overall look and feel and especially when it is a pet .,art
we are trying to get the personality and the character and the life .,art
and i do not think it necessarily matter that thats not the exact yellow or thats not the exact green .,art
it is meant to be what it is in that picture .,art
because yeah because also they change color in the sunlight .,art
they change color in the house .,art
the cat and the dog and pet are always looking slightly different color anyway when them in real life .,art
i do not think it is that important to get the exact color .,art
thats amazing .,art
i need to send you a photo of a customer who sent me a photo that i can use this a a reference .,art
it is hilarious .,art
the pet wasnt in focus at all .,art
because yeah what you are saying about color though if you are in focus ive got a tux in your cat .,art
but in the sunlight he this the only thing thats reflected is he almost marmite or vegemite color .,art
it is he black but he got that brown undertone that yeah only sunlight can catch .,art
yeah i always love pet in sunlight .,art
i always ask my customer could you have a picture of them in the sunlight ?,art
because it doe shine differently .,art
and i feel you can capture a lot more different depth of color .,art
you get the true color i reckon in sunlight .,art
and better detail thats always the hardest .,art
i am guessing you get the same with memorial piece when it is an older photo .,art
and it is not you can ask for more you can piece your thought .,art
and you want to i find memorial are the hardest because you want to do the best possible for them .,art
and yeah wanting to make it look them .,art
and yeah .,art
and then it is that guessing game .,art
i guess thats where the knowledge of anatomy and generally research a come in handy .,art
lot and lot of practice .,art
i think thats one thing i realized i forgot about even though i paint a lot and i paint a lot of people pet i forget to personally practice .,art
because i made this book for myself .,art
and i thought maybe other people might want something this since ive needed something this because i i wanted to have a chance to try out different paper try out different technique try out different medium .,art
and i never find the time because i am always doing commission .,art
and i thought why do not i do little square of stuff .,art
it started off a my idea wa a sheet of paper of different different part of fur and then try those out .,art
and i thought wouldnt it be cool to do that the rule of one hundred where you do something one hundred time and then you are a master at it thing .,art
and i thought when my husband wa will not you do a book of one hundred picture ?,art
he a book of one hundred picture .,art
and now that amazon can print i thought i can do a book for myself .,art
that would be cool .,art
i thought might a see if other artist need it .,art
and it is been it is blown up .,art
people love this idea .,art
and i am happy that i could be the one to share it with people and make something that people enjoy .,art
it is helpful .,art
whether you are starting out or this is your six hundred and thirty twozero portrait .,art
and you realize that you havent painted an annoying poodle in a while .,art
and youve seen the headache of the cow and you are going i need to spend an hour looking at these girl in the book rather than looking at the customer per girl .,art
but yeah i think it is helpful .,art
the thing that you think i should do this for myself ha become something that people go wow i need that .,art
i need this in my life to assist .,art
and yeah with the fact that amazon this book wa printed in sydney .,art
all the way from the uk .,art
all the way from your brain to the uk .,art
from something .,art
it is very cool .,art
and i your idea .,art
and i think i am going to start practicing that at timed not timed a in pressure but time .,art
ive got an hour .,art
let work on this cat nose .,art
because i know that there feature that ive either spent too long on it or overthought for too much over on one piece .,art
i think this will be good to refining and controlling i guess .,art
not controlling .,art
i am trying to figure out the word of ensuring that the quality is the same but giving myself that time and precision still .,art
yes definitely .,art
and i also have come up with the there the british wildlife edition of this now .,art
and it is filled with british wildlife one .,art
yeah look this is a british wildlife one .,art
i think you should .,art
it is not on my list now but it will be for the future .,art
weve done possum and weve got possum here .,art
thats true .,art
yeah that is for a client in australia .,art
i think i think we need to do .,art
now it will be on my list for the future but now ive got ten others .,art
ive been working on because ive also ive released the florals edition .,art
if you are interested in practicing flower and greenery and raindrop and dew drop on petal and all that stuff thats all in the florals edition .,art
and then i am currently working on the african wildlife one .,art
elephant and giraffe and lion and all that stuff .,art
i am very excited about because ive never drawn any of this ever .,art
and it is been fun because i draw the cover myself .,art
all of the one on the cover are my drawing .,art
it is been nice to practice and have that on the cover a to show whats possible for the bird .,art
ive been doing that for the african wildlife one .,art
and then ive got a human portrait one coming out .,art
if you want to practice human portraiture .,art
that but i do not know about you but human scummy .,art
human portrait scummy .,art
i do not know there something about human portrait that i am no no .,art
have you done much of it ?,art
i have done one portrait and it wa a side profile with a dog and it owner .,art
and luckily it wa quite easy but gosh no .,art
i will never advertise that i do human .,art
they i do not know there something about it .,art
what about you ?,art
i used to do it all the time for my friend at school i because i did not have any money or anything when you are at school and i used to draw a portrait of them and give it to them for their birthday .,art
that wa all i did all my friend year of portrait of themselves or a portrait of u together and that thing .,art
i think i wa born in the wrong year .,art
maybe back in the renaissance or yeah .,art
yeah youd be surely paint during the king and queen .,art
then i could be a kept woman .,art
but how bizarre she ha a job and she paint .,art
i think i am born in the perfect year especially with social medium .,art
where we love our pet crucially .,art
people love their pet equally a crucially a i do .,art
do you have pet then ?,art
ive got two cat .,art
they are absolutely bonkers .,art
they are two boy and i love them to piece and they tolerate me .,art
i am a little bit of a fan .,art
what about you ?,art
tell me more about your cat .,art
what breed are they ?,art
i can not logistically but it is fine .,art
ive got my yeah weve got boy and here an xstraight .,art
weve got our backyard and then we coached him in .,art
we showed him that fume are nice and now he is he domestic .,art
it is gon na be evil .,art
cry for food .,art
he will beg for him .,art
he love being tucked up in bed .,art
he is a he hit the truck .,art
this is boy .,art
ive got him on card .,art
he beautiful .,art
he an eight kilo cat .,art
wow he a beautiful cat .,art
he lovely .,art
i love him to piece and then we i say recently it is been two to three year .,art
recently adopted this one and that one percy who like to paint with me .,art
he a typical tuxedo .,art
they spray themselves a bit .,art
hell run after the dog in our street .,art
he play with them .,art
yep he missing brain cell but i love him at the same time .,art
yeah green that .,art
i think it is almost that color that you are showing that green .,art
yeah this one this would be a good color for you .,art
i think if i wa gon na yeah i always practice with my pet first .,art
yeah i feel it is very handy .,art
thats it is your water color it is lovely and unique and i am loving how this eye is progressing it is interesting to see it develop .,art
because normally i leave eye to the last .,art
see you thats funny .,art
if they go through that freaky stage i am ooh you do not look .,art
but then the moment i finish the eye i am yep painting done .,art
i can scan it you send it off .,art
why do you to do the eye last ?,art
i think because i can clean my palette .,art
ive never i do not think there a reason why i do it last it is being habitual .,art
but then it varies when i wa doing the white cat i did her eye first .,art
and then built around the eye because being white it is i wanted to something to look at while painting .,art
but with the eye i think because they are such a treat .,art
almost they are my dessert i guess .,art
and i very .,art
yeah they can transform you start with the eye .,art
yeah again for that same reason they are my favorite part to do .,art
i do not want to wait till the end no i do not want to do it now .,art
i do not want my dessert after food i want them afterwards .,art
yeah i always do the eye first and then i feel ive got a focal point to develop because i always start from the eye and then the nose and then spread out from there with the fur .,art
this is weird i do backwards .,art
thats funny .,art
i do fur and then either ear if it is the cavalia ear or nose then eye or sometimes nose ear eye but thats weird .,art
yeah thats the way that you do the complete opposite .,art
and ive noticed i do it a lot many other people .,art
another artist i am not sure if her .,art
she doe it back .,art
i do it backwards .,art
she doe it technically the way you .,art
there no way .,art
i love seeing how people work it is almost being at market .,art
seeing clay is one of those awesome thing that make me go wow .,art
it is the same mud same particle of glass and material and all that .,art
and then you put it under high temperature and it all turn out different .,art
yeah and thats what i love running the market being at a market seeing all the different material same material but different us .,art
it is amazing what our brain are able to do .,art
sometimes even the same material with u is ive done color pencil drawing with other color pencil artist and it always look different and specifically the other artist style you can tell who drawn what and i find that interesting .,art
and it is refreshing .,art
thats it .,art
it is refreshing because you do not want to know that there a reason why people go for you .,art
there a reason why they capture i wa watching some of your reel and i holy moly using the pastel capture those undertone .,art
that doesnt versus some people they they do not use that .,art
they do a whole lot of layering with the stroke .,art
thats wow it is moving more against same material .,art
definitely can create the same outcome and thats what i am looking forward to seeing the difference in these eye .,art
same reference .,art
two artist .,art
i am going to claim that two different time zone make it different a . yes .,art
we are across the world from each other during a scene .,art
it is magical i find it is it is cool to be able to weve both got the same book and we are drawing the same thing and we are world apart and it is it is very exciting .,art
my family from england and i go yeah you go yeah we are off to the pub now and i am wait if it is this time here how is it that time why are you going to a pub now it is all because i can not yeah .,art
thats funny .,art
but thats what i love about yeah the fact that you can go on a tiktok live and people are yeah i am watching it from france .,art
i would never thought back i am trying to think emerson wa probably the closest to travel chatting when i wa little .,art
but i only talked to my friend though that i saw at school i saw i go but how are you doing ?,art
yeah i saw you but how you going what are you doing ?,art
yeah and now yeah perfectly two stranger can talk to each other on social medium catch up .,art
and learn i am learning much from you about watercolor i am very tempted to try i do have a set of watercolor ive got these windsor and newton one .,art
the black is that good ?,art
yeah it is always i found out many thing going to the art shop i never realized there a brand called rembrandt i think .,art
theyve got kotman kotman windsor and newton owns them and they have a little bit le pigment dense than what windsor and newton have i love tracking these people .,art
whats in it ?,art
i find the their paint are quite beautiful they are nicely mould one thing ive learned ive dabbled in making my own watercolor .,art
is you you grind it extra on glass you have this glass muller and you grind it and thats what can assist in the binding of the binder i am the great explanation analysis .,art
it is it is .,art
you bind it with the binder it is distilled water ive got the other one .,art
ox skull and yeah you mull it and it is the granulation is what they look for when you mix in it is the granulation when you test it out .,art
no i understand that ive got i got ta do camera to take to do the video for my tutorial and i feel i am i have no idea how to use it ive looked up instruction and youtube video and it is too many setting .,art
i am doing it on my phone .,art
it is too many setting .,art
sorry this is one of the learn my craft website tutorial .,art
take a deep cleansing breath .,art
deep cleansing breath .,art
thats how we are going to start this podcast .,art
we are going to start with that .,art
hey guy it is lost .,art
and this is the second episode of the apple sleep another apple sleep experiment podcast .,art
i am joined by a lovely group of people today and we are going to be coming together to talk about the art process .,art
i am more of a moderator here this time .,art
i am not going to necessarily be because your girl can not draw .,art
i did not necessarily help that much in that sense but my lovely wife mag she wa the one who you were the art director .,art
you were the one in charge when it came to the how the art wa distributed and everything .,art
and we are going to go over those process .,art
we are going to talk to a few of the artist and yeah .,art
let go down the list and let introduce ourselves .,art
let start with cloud9 .,art
my name is cloud9 or the life on cloud9 if you want to be fancy .,art
my pronoun are they them theirs .,art
i wa an artist for pretty much the entirety of another apple sleep experiment featured in all four episode a me and my compadre over here recently discovered .,art
took part in a big deal of it .,art
yeah thats pretty much me .,art
i do not have anything else exciting .,art
please move on .,art
and then we have callisto .,art
i go by he him and i have a cat viper .,art
i love that .,art
then it is me magpie .,art
she her or she ?,art
or she i realized it is sound the candy .,art
i am chocolate and my factoid is i do not know .,art
i wa going to say your chocolate .,art
thats your factoid .,art
thats my factoid .,art
the end .,art
a cloud said i wa in all four and did not realize it until today .,art
my pronoun are he they .,art
and i do not have a factoid about myself. . marci you have factoid sir .,art
my factoid is i have no brain today .,art
and that is completely valid .,art
we are going to try to get through this .,art
we got this .,art
it is fact .,art
it is fact .,art
it is fact .,art
we have nick .,art
yeah my name is nick .,art
i go by mindless sketching or nick or mindless nick .,art
it depends what medium i am on .,art
but i use she her pronoun .,art
and i drove six hour .,art
thats arbitrary .,art
but i drove six hour to be here .,art
very excited to get started .,art
i think you win fact .,art
and then sunny .,art
hello my name is sunny .,art
my pronoun are he him and she her .,art
i have done lot of art thing for lot of people in the ten plus year ive been in fandom .,art
ive also done voice acting thing .,art
and today i am voice acting someone who is not sick .,art
and then lastly but not leastly but not leastly flutty voice .,art
and i got over the covid .,art
nothing can kill me bitch .,art
life is the best factoid .,art
the process of doing art for project is a lost come to me and say i need art .,art
and then i sit i am a computer for a moment and i think to myself can i do it all myself ?,art
and ninety nine.nine of the time i answer no .,art
there is that zero.one of the time that i take on too much then my friend have to bail me out .,art
i love and hate them both .,art
they are great .,art
they are horrible .,art
i go into way too much detail but i feel thats a benefit for artist in my opinion i hope .,art
not only do i put the script of what it is based on but i will give them character reference background reference .,art
ill give them the expression from the character the context surrounding the image that they do not have to read everything because reading suck .,art
how long are your art doc usually ?,art
this is not for apple sleep specifically but i have a comparison .,art
there wa a project we were doing and the script itself wa about fourteen to fifteen page and the art doc ended up being one hundred page that did not include the reference page .,art
but it make everything cohesive and hopefully it make people not worry about whether or not their art going to match the next person .,art
i am a stickler for detail i always try to remember every nitpick little thing .,art
and even then i can not predict everything .,art
and then based on the project we will create a server with the artist .,art
we did for this one because it wa a very very massive undertaking .,art
and to be honest it is one of my favorite part of the production process is hanging out with all the artist .,art
i find that we lift each other up .,art
and thats not always true for server on discord .,art
but artist seem to promote other artist or help whenever they can .,art
or i do not know it is such a joy to go and see work in progress and stuff that is not even for the project .,art
one of my favorite thing when i am down is scrolling through the show me what you are doing show me what you are working on .,art
i am interested in all that .,art
it is fun .,art
how many artist in total did we have for this for all the project ?,art
that would have been a fantastic number to realize before coming here .,art
i glanced at the server .,art
it look there about thirtyish people in there now .,art
that sound about .,art
i think the most on any project ive ever had wa about fifty .,art
but i think for apple sleep too it wa somewhere in the mid30s .,art
a couple did not want to be a part of the server and thats fine .,art
reaching out to artist i talked about this to sunny the other day .,art
i have such crippling anxiety when it come to reaching out to people because ninety nine of the time i feel they are annoyed or bothered .,art
why would i want to go back and make more pony art for you ?,art
there this inherent fear in my head of i am asking too much .,art
i am asking too much of people .,art
they are going to be too busy .,art
i am bugging them .,art
i am annoying them .,art
and it is almost never the case .,art
and even when they are not available it is always but catch me next time .,art
or i enjoyed working with you in the past .,art
ill watch it when it is done to support you that way .,art
but my top priority a the art director is to make sure every single artist feel respected and appreciated .,art
a detailed a the art doc is i also want their creative interpretation too .,art
there a reason we go to many different people .,art
god i love seeing all the different art style .,art
there a few that came to me and they are i do not know if i can match show style .,art
and i am great cool .,art
thats what we are looking for .,art
i love some people call it the chaos of different style but i love it .,art
and especially work for a grimdark series because you never know what to expect .,art
and every single person that wa a part of this project put ten time the amount of detail in each image than i wa ever expecting .,art
and it is a treat .,art
it made the story come alive in a completely different way than even myself a the author anticipated .,art
because i do not remember if i said this in the first podcast episode or not .,art
a i am writing i see it play out a movie .,art
and my finger try to keep up .,art
when i look at other people interpretation of it visually it is much fun .,art
i have a blast with that .,art
i try to make realistic deadline with wiggle room because for me it is life always come before pony art .,art
and there sometimes where you can not make a deadline and youve got to have that little week or two extension .,art
and i understand that .,art
i always try to give artist .,art
i would love to give them two month but depending on how quickly we need it i always give them a minimum of a month to get me an image .,art
and far thats been pretty reasonable for most people .,art
because yeah life happens .,art
and i am not going to be that person to be all upset with them if they do not get it done or whatever .,art
and with some wiggle room i can either tackle the image myself if they need to back out which again fine .,art
or i can have someone from the server help .,art
i said that server is a lifesaver in many aspect .,art
i know that i had marcy specifically bail me out for the first part of appalachic part two .,art
i wa marcy i need an additional image for this thing .,art
and he yeah .,art
how many image do you usually ask per scene ?,art
obviously we have a history with doing similar project this with princess trixie sparkle and thing on your channel .,art
but with my channel obviously it is more of we use one image per scene .,art
but there are instance where we get multiple image .,art
this is based off my own opinion of the story and the piece .,art
and it is not because it is my writing .,art
it is for any project i go into where i am putting together an art doc .,art
there wasnt anything else technically going on that needed clarification visually .,art
plus i would also say too the attention to detail on sunnys image is i love doing slow panouts or slow zoom in when there lot of detail in the image .,art
and i know weve been very very blessed with a lot of the artist that we work with .,art
that the detailing is fucking insane .,art
absolutely incredible .,art
for narration and stuff that it is perfect .,art
but in that same part one there are three image in a very short amount of time because the scene shifted .,art
we had twilight outside of starlight room and then twilight crawling through with the broken wall and then twilight in the room .,art
and that happened much quicker than different other segment of the story .,art
i break it up depending on what do i think would be visually dynamic and not necessarily about every little thing ha to be visually showcased .,art
because a lot of i would say half of the art of this project is art and half of it is audio .,art
and i want the audio to shine too .,art
pt a a side note because i know thats another one i am known for doing big project with is a little bit different because it is not audio driven .,art
it is all dialogue .,art
image need to tell more of the story whereas this is a narrative .,art
and the audio is supposed to be a companion to the art .,art
i wanted to go down the list and have everybody talk about their experience on the project .,art
there a couple bullet point that ive already given everybody to .,art
but for the most part though you guy are going to be hearing what it wa to work on the project and what wa expected and thing that .,art
starting with callisto .,art
it wa wonderful to work on this project .,art
it wa an experience that i wa very happy to have and i am grateful for it .,art
my art appeared in all the episode except for episode two .,art
i wa sadly absent for that one .,art
i wa going to say you had a big part in episode three .,art
i do remember three having much callisto art .,art
especially when aj pop out of her cocoon .,art
i do not know how to fucking describe it .,art
i the interpretation of the monster from callisto .,art
yeah though when it wa first transforming .,art
that wa good .,art
it is a digital software .,art
ive never even heard of that one .,art
i wa going to say i havent heard that one too .,art
you use tablet then ?,art
is it possible to have a piece that you both hate and love ?,art
yes it is .,art
i have plenty of fanfics that that is the case .,art
yall remember the piece where i finally got to do some bloody artwork with apple bloom ?,art
that one wa a pain to do .,art
i loved the outcome .,art
but when i wa first doing the sketch work the layout of the room messed with me .,art
i think it wa my dyslexia because i wasnt reading it .,art
but it took me forever to get it in my opinion .,art
everybody always mention the little cameo of lost and me in the corner of that image .,art
it is cheerful amidst all the death .,art
it is great .,art
see no my favorite piece is not even a piece that ended up in the reading .,art
it wa that shitpost art that you drew of twilight back all you drawn shitpost art .,art
ti a bitch .,art
ti a bitch .,art
ti a bitch .,art
it wa yeah thats thats the whole vibe .,art
thats the vibe .,art
when we all found out about ending i guess it did not affect it a much .,art
i guess the only one would have to be the sculpture painting where i had to know all the face and who had died .,art
i wa sad about i can not remember his name .,art
he the white pegasus with the yellow main dying because i wa no not him .,art
wa it both biceps ?,art
yeah that wa .,art
luckily i am not one to get easily upset because there wa nothing that made me upset about this community .,art
it wa wonderful and i have nothing negative to say .,art
from an art perspective it wa fun because it challenged me .,art
ive never done a lot of background piece that before .,art
it wa very fun from a fan expected .,art
it wa having an anime moment there because i am crap i am working with two big youtubers .,art
terrifying and happy .,art
it is not too excited .,art
you are a good company for terrifying .,art
thats about it .,art
wa close to the one that did the most artwork piece .,art
we have that written down .,art
hold on .,art
yeah we have a doc for that one moment .,art
let find the doc .,art
yes callisto did the most .,art
thats what i thought .,art
i wa going to say because thats what i thought .,art
no thank you again for that .,art
this statement is from spen charlie .,art
firstly i never thought i would be part of such a big project .,art
it wa an honor a an artist and a great experience .,art
i also learned a lot .,art
i will continue to try and improve my art style and look forward to future collaboration .,art
thank you lost and mag .,art
i appear in all four .,art
i believe i did have to double check on that a . marcia and i are in the same boat currently and that boat ha multiple hole in it sinking .,art
i did appear in all four .,art
i did a piece for the the intro .,art
i guess build up before shit go down in episode one of twilight handing out checklist of all the shit for the main six to do .,art
and then episode two i wa pinkie pie focused .,art
episode three i did one for rd and one for rarity .,art
and then episode four with the big reveal .,art
that wa i think that wa the most i contributed to to episode four .,art
yeah pretty much in all four episode for me .,art
i do try to sketch sometimes on paper to get a rough feel for thing .,art
i i remember there wa one banner of the fallen that i designed for mag that i crudely threw together on paper .,art
but i am ninety to ninety five digital on procreate the mobile program on a tablet .,art
i liked everything that i did for this pretty much .,art
i say i think the one that were my favorite were for the last episode .,art
episode four with apple .,art
have we i am sorry have we given a spoiler warning for this ?,art
am i allowed to talk about the ending ?,art
fuck it it is been a year .,art
if they havent seen it it is their fault .,art
you have to watch it by now .,art
what are you doing ?,art
what are you doing ?,art
why are you here ?,art
why are you here ?,art
anyways yeah you should go watch the fucking sequel .,art
yeah my favorite i think were in the last episode with the reveal of apple bloom .,art
i had the most fun putting that one together .,art
it wa the most i think attention to detail ive put into a piece in a while .,art
enjoyed that one .,art
episode three with rarity specifically wa another artistic challenge for me but it ended up being fun .,art
i got to write bloody message on wall thats always fun and a great time .,art
my part wa when sugarcube corner get burned to the ground and all pinky can do is watch .,art
that one trying to draw a building on fire and then the interior where aj is still in the building .,art
shes in a building thats burning but not burning herself .,art
trying to figure that one out .,art
yeah that one i say i do say i had to take a step back a couple time and reach out to people and being am i doing this ?,art
i think that one maybe wa took the longest i would say .,art
i liked the piece that wa in part one with the sticky note .,art
that wa that wa that wa perfection for me .,art
i wa telling meg i my logic behind that wa because i reached out to meg and i wa hey my scene take place in the throne room .,art
starlight now the element of honesty .,art
and they are trying to erase all evidence of aj pretty much existing it seems .,art
would they make any effort to cover up that cutie mark on the seat on her throne ?,art
and my thought behind it because meg wa yeah sure it would probably be covered up in some capacity .,art
my brain they are going to try to erase it and get rid of it and pretend it is not there but they are not going to think too hard about it .,art
they want to cover it up and forget about it .,art
they are going to hastily yeah we are going to sticky note some shit on top of it with starlight cutie mark and call it a day .,art
we do not have to think about it anymore .,art
that wa my logic behind that .,art
and i am glad it worked out .,art
we were privy to some early draft over here .,art
we werent given away a ton out the gate obviously .,art
but we did get some early little teaser here and there and bouncing idea back and forth .,art
a lot of it wasnt for me at least too surprising when it came out the gate for everyone else .,art
but it wa fun to see everyone el reaction .,art
can confirm that is one of the best part .,art
i i love community aspect of any project .,art
i love seeing everyone el work that get put into it .,art
i always love bouncing off of other artist and seeing what they are doing .,art
ive been in project this many a year at this point .,art
it is it is always fun to see .,art
i always love the community aspect .,art
people coming together to make some awesome shit .,art
it is great .,art
it is a great tag line .,art
people come together to make some awesome shit .,art
i only have one word for it and it is good .,art
it wa gentle too .,art
the following statement is from flutterpaws .,art
working on aase wa a fantastic experience overall .,art
i got the opportunity to work on this project during a time when i wa struggling to find any momentum to draw .,art
accepting the offer helped break me out of the i do not know what to draw i will not draw at all cycle .,art
honestly i fangirled a little bit being able to work with mag on this project .,art
plus ive always been a fan of psychological horror this wa up my alley .,art
it wa also a fun challenge to fit all my idea into a single image .,art
it tested my art block and let me have a nice amount of creative liberty .,art
overall creating art for this project helped me remember to enjoy the process and not set any heavy expectation on yourself when creating .,art
because it might turn out better than you expected .,art
thank you both .,art
i am in all four segment much to my surprise .,art
do you remember what scene or stuff that ?,art
i can not remember the exact segment .,art
but i know for episode one i wa near the beginning .,art
no no maybe towards the middle .,art
for applesuite specifically i only used a tablet for procreate .,art
but funnily enough i now i have my own .,art
but at the time i wa using cloud tablet to draw everything .,art
it wa interesting trying to find time to trade off the tablet for each of u to do our segment .,art
mom said it is my turn with the ipad .,art
let me tell you a little thing about brick .,art
there wa two to start out there are two segment that i enjoyed .,art
one of them wa a mag referred to it a her rescue piece where she forgot to put in a segment for art .,art
and i came in the first episode and did it for her and it is twilight in her room .,art
i liked that one .,art
and then there wa another one i liked with pinkie pie and applejack in sugarcube corner .,art
i love the detail and stuff on that one .,art
but the thing that got under my skin is for my first segment i decided let draw twilight walking up to her basement door .,art
and obviously it is in a castle basement there all your brick for you .,art
and i wa i can do that .,art
i can individually shade all these brick .,art
and after that segment wa done i messaged in the server and said i am never drawing another brick ever again .,art
episode four i am i am going to jump on this .,art
i am going to be one of the first to pick a segment .,art
and i picked my segment and i wa it is apple bloom breaking applejack out of prison .,art
and they are running away from the guard .,art
and i am they are going to be running through canterlot .,art
and i wa convinced they were running through a canterlot street .,art
and i went what ?,art
i should probably message mag .,art
are they running through canterlot or somewhere else ?,art
and mag wa no they are in a dungeon a brick dungeon .,art
he made the biggest deal in the discord server about his hatred for brick from part one .,art
to have you pick the only image in part four with brick the only one .,art
the only one .,art
it wa it wa i am going to i thought they were running through canterlot and then mag wa no they are in a dungeon .,art
they are in a brick dungeon .,art
and i went let let do this .,art
and yeah i i drew about one hundred more brick and four full body pose .,art
on top of that .,art
and yeah i never ever want to look at another fucking brick again .,art
such a good story though .,art
it is one of my favorite .,art
i remember the watch party and everyone being about the brick .,art
a mentioned with cloud i believe i am not sure if cloud and i were together the first time we talked about it .,art
i think i remember mag and i talking about it when i wa over one time .,art
and i before i think it wa even before you guy were writing it yet .,art
you were we have this idea and you guy you guy laid it out for me .,art
the end plot twist and everything .,art
and i wa this sound interesting .,art
i did know do not think it affected my art that much .,art
the thing that affected my art the most wa i wa is there an official design for applejack ?,art
and i remember lost specifically saying no we want there to be a discrepancy because of the plot twist because it is in everyones it is everyones different depiction in their mind .,art
that wa one of my favorite thing about with reading the comment with each of the episode because everyone wa why doe he look different here ?,art
what the hell going on ?,art
and then they would all speculate .,art
and a lot of people got it .,art
a lot of people were yeah they are they are on the shit .,art
we know what the fuck .,art
but that wa the lovely thing about the artwork .,art
the thing that everybody used to point out especially with other audio drama wa the artwork are all different .,art
i remember i would see fuckloads of comment that .,art
and i looked at mag and i remember when we were trying to figure out those idea i wa no i want to fucking utilize it and twist it on it head because now people are thinking is that a ten ?,art
i am exploiting it at that point i guess on some level .,art
and looking at marcys piece the one in the kitchen with pinkie pie ajs eye are almost completely blackened .,art
and yet in the very next scene it talk about ajs eye being red and glowing .,art
and i did not give direction to marcy to blacken the eye there .,art
but that wa a nice little thing of why are her eye different visually ?,art
i that that affected my art the most wa the no there not an official design for applejack go hog wild with it .,art
even in my applejack in different segment if she wa in another segment that i did she purposely looked different because i wa if thats the case then i am going to mess around with it in each of my different art piece .,art
because i remember lost looking at me and going no have fun with it .,art
i loved the group chat .,art
i remember i swear there wasnt a single day that we did not talk in it whether itd be about a project about the project about something else .,art
i feel we were all we all fit in the same pod if that make sense .,art
we were all talking and happy about it .,art
any voice channel that we had wa super nice .,art
everyone wa super nice .,art
and then i remember after the project wa over i think i think it wa calypso .,art
i can not remember who messaged and said are we deleting this server ?,art
or can we please keep this server ?,art
because we all we all loved it much .,art
i know that that made my heart melt too .,art
i loved working on this project .,art
i always love mag art document not even going to lie .,art
they are easy to navigate .,art
thank you .,art
they it explains it .,art
but there still a point where you have that artistic freedom .,art
and i love i love it when creator give artist a little bit of freedom .,art
funnily enough i did used to watch all these the grimdarks and thing that growing up .,art
but i fell out of it .,art
it wasnt until i met cloud that i got back into it .,art
i had not seen the first one until i met cloud .,art
working on it wa i wasnt huge geeking out about it because i did not i did not know what it wa until a year or two prior .,art
i think it wa fun .,art
this statement is by bella pink savage .,art
i had a great time drawing for this production .,art
when magpie asked me if i wanted to partake i wa immediately on board .,art
but only if i could have a scene with no gore in it .,art
a i am used to drawing pony being cute and doing wholesome stuff .,art
and i usually get freaked out by the sight of too much blood or viscera .,art
naturally i ended up testing my limit lol .,art
i do not know why but i decided to draw a little outside of my comfort zone .,art
a little blood on rarity forehead did not sound too bad .,art
but the longer i worked on the rarity and twilight picture the more detail i wanted to add .,art
i am proud how they came out .,art
i am happy i stepped out of my comfort zone .,art
it wa a great learning experience .,art
i can not thank you enough mag for the opportunity .,art
i am looking forward to drawing more fucked up pony in the future .,art
yeah i wa in episode one three and four .,art
in episode one i got to have the real fun part of ending the episode where starlight dy .,art
and we twilight get bonked out by a known figure which we learn later .,art
and then in episode three i had two different part .,art
i had the scene where the syringe is thrown through the window and rarity is reacting to it during the dark and stormy night .,art
and then i also had the scene later on where her and applejack are fighting for the scissors to try and outbrew each other and stuff that .,art
and then in the final episode i had the scene where start to have a resolution and apple bloom is called outside by the royal guard and shes explaining to them whats going on .,art
all of my artwork is digital from the beginning to the end .,art
i do all of my artwork on photoshop .,art
thats what ive always used my bread and butter .,art
and for my specific tablet i have used the same wacom intuos that ive had since i started drawing ten year ago .,art
and shes on her last leg but shes the old reliable .,art
i can not trade her out .,art
thats a mood .,art
i think for my favorite piece it is a toss up between my piece i did for the first episode where twilight find starlight and shes bleeding out on the floor .,art
and the image i did where applejack and barrity are fighting for the scissors in both for different reason .,art
one of the thing i about halloween project in general is not the tangent but my style is generally a little bit more on the clean side .,art
and i enjoy these sort of project because it let me experiment and expand on my style in way that i usually do not get the opportunity to .,art
and thats way i experimented i guess with both piece .,art
in the first one experimented with some different shading method where starlight is bleeding and twilight is holding her a shes taking her final breath and stuff that .,art
and composition wise i think it is also one of my favorite with the lighting and the shadow .,art
and then for the second image with applejack and barrity where they are fighting and applejack is overpowering her .,art
i experimented with that one .,art
it wa in a rush and i guess it worked in my favor because i used a lot le of a clean lining style for that image .,art
and i think it added to the overall ruggedness and the mood and the atmosphere that is already being conveyed through the voice acting and stuff that .,art
and then i guess the only not trouble thing that infuriated me wa in the last image i did for episode four i the wheelchair .,art
and i loved that .,art
yeah it is not angle and perspective that you typically see .,art
i think for that one of the i always try to make my image a little bit more cinematic and a little bit more interesting .,art
i always to try and play with rule of third and perspective .,art
and whats important to the audience versus what do i know a the artist what do i want you to focus on versus what do you think you are supposed to focus on ?,art
and i always try to i guess i do not say make them boring but one of the thing ive been trying to experiment with my art the last few year is different angle different perspective .,art
and i think that it look cool but it also ha helped me grow a an artist a . i did not know about any of the plot twist .,art
i am going to be honest going into this project i knew i wanted to help but a lot of the time for a lot of project i am in i also want to experience it a a viewer a much a possible .,art
i try to gather a much information a i need to holistically complete whatever my portion of the project is in a way thats effective and conveys the information it need to .,art
but also i do not to be spoiled and i to view the content i am creating and all the content that other people are creating when it is all put together .,art
and i am going to be honest most of the time whoever i am working with i say give me something and then i focus on that .,art
i did not know about i did not know about any of the plot twist .,art
i am thoroughly impressed with that .,art
it is a not common but if ive a few artist have said that they want to enjoy the ride .,art
and they i wa going to say your art doc are good at facilitating that because they realistically only have to look at their segment and there enough information there that they could technically get away with not getting spoiled .,art
and i am thoroughly impressed with that .,art
because i with the attention to detail that you put into your art i would have not known that .,art
or doe it not matter what doe matter ?,art
that way it also doesnt break your atmosphere a a viewer .,art
i think a far a the community aspect it went smoothly .,art
it wa nice to be able to have access to all the document in one place .,art
that wa organized and community wise with having access to everybody else in the project in a respectful way .,art
if you have a question you can always ask it and there always going to be an answer which i always think is helpful especially for i know there some newer people on this project and i know that there are a lot of question asked .,art
and i think creating a solid community which you guy have you guy usually do is the foundation for how smoothly thing go .,art
but i think thats a big aspect of it is you guy make thing easy and you create a space where people know they can ask question of other people and of yourselves and that facilitates how smoothly thing run .,art
my gosh doe that mean weve run good project mag ?,art
i got apparently apparently apparently .,art
it is project these where i get to step out of my comfort zone and in a good way .,art
i think a an artist you always need to be stepping outside of what you are comfortable in in order to get better .,art
i think thats with a lot of thing but especially with art .,art
and i do not think there any harm in trying new medium or anything that .,art
i think thats how thats how style change and grow but thats how we become who we are a artist .,art
and it is always i can say for example there are thing from this project that i did not used to do before .,art
and then i experimented with it and then now it is part of my actual style in a cleaner method .,art
from a fan perspective though it is always it is nice to see thing a not reimagined but continued wa a big fan of the original apple sleep .,art
and i think the other thing wa that there wa a lot of people in this project who ive known for a while and who ive worked with for a while .,art
and whenever everything come together it is cool to see how everybody ha changed and improved and grown .,art
one hundred percent .,art
can i eat my mcdonalds now ?,art
yes yes you fucking can .,art
i believe that in .,art
it is it is one of the more valid extra thought it is it is the thought that is going through my head now a my food is staring at me .,art
the following statement is from corva bug .,art
my name is corva bug formerly known a fokie yacht or kninety studio .,art
and i adore this project and had much fun being a part of such a spooky tale .,art
i love how mind bending the end reveal wa finding out the mare behind all of the chaos wa very interesting to me .,art
the little clue to thing not being what they seemed were another thing i adored .,art
i love how we made aj seem some unstoppable force .,art
you never know what truly happened until the end .,art
i wish we had pushed the mind breaking and twisting a bit more showing glimpse of the others point of view or flickering into reality and hallucination .,art
however i can not complain with the end product .,art
this project made me jump out of my comfort zone and push my art much more .,art
i am blessed to have worked on such a production .,art
everybody did such an incredible job and all of them are the most talented and inspiring people i have ever met .,art
i hope they are all proud of what they have accomplished .,art
all the work they have poured into this is incredible .,art
this project changed how i looked at my art and pushed my skill .,art
i can look at what i had done in this project and how much it ha affected my art now .,art
i am incredibly blessed to have been a part of this with many amazing people .,art
next time ill for sure push my creepiness more or maybe keep thing cutesy and fun .,art
sincerely raven .,art
i did the first look that we get of applejack in part one .,art
i did the scene of rarity when shes got her back on the floor and shes bloodied up with the scissors next to her .,art
and then and that wa in part three .,art
i knew i did the part where twilight wandering around the orchard being scared of tree .,art
but i also did the part where ditsy is bringing all of the package back to apple bloom at the castle .,art
i use in term of hardware i use a desktop computer and a wacom .,art
i think it is nintendos pro .,art
it is very old and very janky .,art
in term of program i use clip studio paint and i do it all in clip studio paint .,art
yay a clip friend .,art
thats what i used .,art
my wing clipped .,art
my favorite is the first shot of applejack because i experimented a lot with ive always loved doing rendered background that do not rely on line work and character that have a little bit of line work in them .,art
getting to experiment with that wa great .,art
and i how it came out overall .,art
that wa the first time i got a feel for how i do my style now .,art
that wa neat .,art
you are an integral part of my current artistic style .,art
i love hearing shit that to be honest .,art
yeah yeah i think working with the time constraint and you guy do set reasonable time limit for the art .,art
that definitely help push me to cut corner in a way where i am still happy with the final product .,art
that wa definitely the case with that picture .,art
i wa a little i wouldnt say frustrated but i pushed myself a little too hard with part four where i wa already going through some rl stuff .,art
and i desperately wanted to multiple picture of that scene with twilight and the old orchard because i thought it would look cool to have different interlacing picture of her disoriented and wandering around with all these creepy looking tree .,art
and there some some background element .,art
i think if you squint i i am not sure how visible they are in the final product but where you can see pony on the tree hanging or or with a shovel in them they were in part one .,art
my god i found some .,art
hold on .,art
i know now now i am going to go back and look at the fucking art .,art
hold on .,art
i did not know that .,art
fuck those piece with twilight losing her fucking shit .,art
they were they were some of my favorite because it wa whats obvious we do not twilight in this .,art
but the the emotional anguish you are good with facial expression and the way it is conveyed in the insanity and stuff that .,art
but the picture with ditsy on the step that it wasnt firmly established in the little blurb the guide blurb that it wa ditsy .,art
i made it because shes the the the tm ponyville male pony .,art
fuck it .,art
there one pure wholesome untouched character in the entirety of apple sleep .,art
she is precious that it take you out of the story because you want to .,art
you are we needed a pallet cleanser .,art
a brief to make the horror push that much harder .,art
one cute little ditsy face. . my god .,art
yeah but all those fucking present though that wa a struggle .,art
presence were my brick .,art
i wound up copy pasting and morphing and color shifting them .,art
i did not have to deal with it .,art
and the angle wa hard .,art
it is it is very much but i think it worked out .,art
no it look you would never be able to tell .,art
thank you .,art
a little bit .,art
i can not remember if mac would come to me to talk to them or if we would get talking and then itd be hey i were talking what did you think of this scene or how is this reading far ?,art
i remember we had a conversation about something is obviously going on .,art
there is a reveal here .,art
what do you think the reveal is ?,art
i did not i did not guess that it would be apple bloom who the culprit wa .,art
i wasnt sure if applejack wa involved or not .,art
but i definitely knew that there were part where she either wasnt there or everyone wa super messed up or something .,art
i think that did play a little bit into how i did my scene but not too much because you are trying to keep it a surprise .,art
i would read ahead in the dock a to everyone el scene because mac is very good about having blurb that are very detailed .,art
and i think thats a positive because it mean that i do not have to think too hard about what detail am i missing ?,art
i do not have to scrub through the entire talk .,art
i never do a thing and make sure that it is cohesive .,art
but i did do that that i wouldnt accidentally contradict something that wa happening later on or if i needed to i could foreshadow something a . i did join the group chat .,art
i am very much the artist working on these project where you give me the deadline i pick my part i disappear from the face of the planet .,art
and then a couple day before the deadline here here your art .,art
and then i run away .,art
but i did pop into the group chat every now and then .,art
and it wa it wa very fun seeing everybody uplift each others art and people were struggling with their whip sometimes and the feedback that everyone wa giving and how cool everyone wa being .,art
it wa it wa a definite good in the project to have that group chat .,art
and the energy wa great .,art
project these are a big part of why i am still in the fandom because i love seeing many different people with many varied talent come together and make something great .,art
and i think you guy were on the money when you said that the disjointed art style work especially for horror because it keep you guessing and you do not know what the next scene is going to look .,art
and that lack of consistency is an underlaying not anxiety but extra little spice little salt on the experience .,art
i especially love how the editing guy were talking earlier about how certain image can linger longer because they convey all you needed to .,art
you also do a lot with the editing that help convey action scene even on a static image .,art
and i think it wa cool to see that play out that .,art
i bring it is not even that my brain i could give you a twenty minute spiel a to why a certain thing wa the end of everything for me mentally .,art
but thats why it is it own podcast .,art
yeah thats why .,art
yeah thats why the editing and the production is it is on podcast because it is going to be an hour of me pitching .,art
and because of that i when it come to the artwork i try to always honor it .,art
and if there a way to amplify it within the editing in how you said with the movement or glitch or weird thing to amp up and bring up the best part of that artwork .,art
thats what i try to do because the project wouldnt be nearly a successful .,art
if not for your guy art it wouldnt .,art
i can tell you that now .,art
yeah thats it .,art
it would not be where it is if not for the art .,art
and thats why the art credit are the biggest aneurysm that i freaking have because and man can tell you i fucking will sit here for hour and meticulously go over the art credit because i am did i spell this person name ?,art
is it on the is there art on the screen long enough mag ?,art
do i need to extend it ?,art
it doesnt help that i have a problem spelling thing correctly .,art
my god do not even give me a start .,art
two writer everyone .,art
two writer .,art
but yeah no i think thats thats a good thing too .,art
is mag wa talking about how great it is to see her writing come alive in the art .,art
the same thing is for the editing .,art
it is a positive feedback loop of mag writes the scene and then my god look at this art .,art
it is the movie i saw in my head and then i give you the art and it is my god look at what you did with the art .,art
thats amazing .,art
you give me life to this thing ive been staring at for three day .,art
yeah this is also part of why i watch project these even when i am not involved is seeing that community effort and that love for what everyone is doing and appreciation for each other .,art
it is great .,art
there are two line i want to highlight .,art
it is it is not necessarily art related but because i wa listening to it the part where pinkie pie is listing all of the cupcake flavor in one of them is blue .,art
i live for that blue flavor lover representation .,art
pinkie pie is such a personal place too .,art
but yeah and then the other line wa when rarity and applejack are facing each other down and rarity is thinking about her dad and then thinking about the syringe and applejack asks lose something .,art
my god the heart punch though .,art
you guy you guy are great writer .,art
you are great at everything .,art
it is it is always wonderful working with you .,art
this statement is by dannys art den .,art
it allowed me to get out of a depressive slump .,art
i knew i would love working with magpie and lost .,art
they had been a pleasure to work with before from previous project angel of mercy and princess trixie sparkle .,art
getting to draw cute colorful character getting violently torn apart is very therapeutic after a day of working retail .,art
mag and lost have been absolute sweetheart .,art
i havent had director that were vocally appreciative of artwork i had never been praised much for my work than i have working for mag and lost .,art
they are hella sweet .,art
they care if we are sick mentally or physically .,art
they kept communication open and friendly .,art
the following statement is from the artist urban kool .,art
this is urban kool in text form because talking is scary .,art
magpie wanted my two cent on working a an artist on another apple sleep experiment .,art
here are my quick thought and feel .,art
the original apple sleep experiment wa one of the first mlp audio drama project i ever assisted with .,art
ive always loved listening to fanfics from the lost narrator and magpie pony while i draw .,art
it wa beyond exciting to contribute to them .,art
naturally when mag poked me about the sequel i wa super hyped to join in .,art
it felt all the work ive done for them wa coming full circle by revisiting the apple sleep universe .,art
i love seeing how it all came together and how hard everyone worked on the project .,art
from the voice acting to the editing and the art it feel a big love letter to everyones journey a creatives .,art
doing art for them ha genuinely helped me improve much and pushed me to come out of my shell .,art
it gave me the confidence i needed to pursue my dream career a a freelance illustrator and start my own project .,art
though i am probably always going to be a social anxious hermit .,art
i want to say that i love and appreciate the fuck out of lost mag for everything .,art
thank you for picking me to be an artist all that time ago and keeping me around to draw edgy horse for you guy .,art
i wa in part two three and four .,art
i wa only at nine and one because i wa not made privy to this magpie .,art
listen you were real busy helping with other thing .,art
yeah i am almost positive .,art
the reason why we did not pull you for the first one is because you were working on the merch for debt .,art
wa it debt to society ?,art
the merch ?,art
you were out busy .,art
you were doing everything else .,art
i will bend over backwards for your guy story. . mostly digital with the what ?,art
they use paint tool side with the wake up tablet .,art
thats my go to .,art
which one did not i ?,art
i think my my two favorite one are the fluttershy fighting off her own animal and rarity getting ready to stab a bitch .,art
that fluttershy .,art
that fluttershy image bloody .,art
that fluttershy image with the fucking animal and her fucking raging .,art
my personal favorite of yours this is a side side thing is .,art
it is the apple bloom with the evil pyramid finger apple bloom .,art
in part four it is great .,art
yeah she had to have her fill and reveal moment .,art
she had to be yes .,art
ive seen a lot of artwork mimicking that or fan art mimicking that pose where shes got her hand her hoof together and diabolicalness .,art
i can not word it is phenomenal .,art
but a picture being bane and i will kill you twilight .,art
i want to go on record .,art
i knew i knew apple bloom wa alive .,art
i knew it .,art
never said that to that mental life .,art
and also yes it affected some of the art because i knew fluttershy wa losing her shit .,art
i am let make this a abstract a possible .,art
and then same with when rarity facing off with applejack .,art
mostly when applejack first breaking in try to have little abstractness and of course rainbow dash panic attack here and little tannock pick .,art
yeah you drew that one too .,art
where rainbow losing her shit .,art
everyone here had contributed a lot which is why we were happy to have you here .,art
and there are a lot of artist that did one or two piece .,art
but you guy and a couple others specifically gave it your all .,art
and i can not thank you enough .,art
he he you deserve it .,art
thank you for letting u be a part of it .,art
it is fun .,art
again from the fan perspective getting to see all the art coming through and it could also help feel inspiration for my own piece be this look cool .,art
i want to try get that level to stuff .,art
it never good a everyone el but it all look cool to see .,art
it is funny how a server based around murder horse and stuff is what some of the most wholesome people .,art
art perspective i loved it .,art
i i do always feel spoiled with magpie art doc because i can i know i can scroll to my segment and everything i need there .,art
i am yeah i do not have to read back on other doc .,art
not that anyone ha to but it is nice to be spoiled to be bring me the reference .,art
it is very nice .,art
it let me turn off my brain and go creative mode .,art
and of course a a fan absolutely love these story .,art
it is what fuel the creativity of art .,art
i i always think art fuel more art .,art
whether thats the story writing or the voice acting or of course the 2d artwork it is always amazing to see .,art
yeah thats thats the one cool thing .,art
i think weve weve talked about it a few time already but the it is it is artwork building upon more artwork building upon art more artwork and there everybody ha different genre that we are creating them in but they are all blending together very very .,art
and i would say beautifully too because of the production aspect and stuff that .,art
brangle burr .,art
thats how we are in there .,art
thats how we are in there .,art
the statement is from safina .,art
hello my name is safina .,art
getting to be an artist on another apple sleep experiment wa a massive honor to me .,art
an apple sleep experiment wa one of the first mlp grimdarks i ever watched after tale of the lost narrator .,art
after working on many other project for lost in mag along with other creator having the opportunity presented to me to work on another apple sleep experiment wa amazing .,art
i begged to be included during a call while watching the premiere of an episode of princess trixie sparkle two when they first announced aase wa in the work .,art
once i wa accepted into the project i got the chance to read over the part of the script before the video were posted .,art
and i wa over the moon with the story that wa being told .,art
mag is a fantastic author and i wa excited to get to be a part of this and work with both lost in mag .,art
having worked on many grimdarks at this point i always loved the challenge of getting an assignment of making something creative within the bound of a story making an art piece that help to tell the story itself .,art
mag and lost have been kind in that regard .,art
not once when something needed changing did i ever feel i wa being spoken down to or not being respected for my work .,art
apology and thanks were always plentiful when a correction need to be made .,art
another aspect that ha fascinated me is the editing .,art
how our work a artist that already say much are brought to life in the video themselves .,art
i am always excited to see the final product of the work everyone put in .,art
overall aase is one of the project that i had the most fun working on .,art
up there with friendship is tragic by scribbler and princess trixie sparkle two by magpypony .,art
ive made many friend and working with other artist always help me to improve my skill by seeing what i love in their art which is a lot because all of these people are crazy talented and trying to incorporate it into my own style .,art
thank you lost and mag for this amazing opportunity .,art
and i look forward to working with you both on pt immortal fliction and any project that come after .,art
it is important that i do this but i will get emotional .,art
do not make fun of me .,art
i want to say this to all of you and to all of the artist who are not here with u in this moment that i am honored .,art
i am honored that you would give me u these hour and sometimes day of your time .,art
i talked about this a little bit in the first podcast but this story i wrote largely on my own .,art
i did not have editor this time around .,art
it wa me and there wa a sense of fear going into the art aspect that people werent going to be jibing with it .,art
i poured a lot of myself into this both knowingly and annoyingly .,art
to have such amazingly talented people be willing and almost happy not almost but happy to help bring a vision from my brain to life is overwhelming which is why i have such a hard time sometimes asking for help because it is i do not always feel worthy .,art
i do not always feel worthy of all of your talent and all of your friendship .,art
that server wa a friendship for me .,art
it wa it wa a fun place to go where i felt i felt i belonged .,art
it is not a secret to lost but i have often said to her i do not consider myself an artist .,art
it make it all the more unmemorable and positive .,art
we even found out detail in image from this podcast .,art
i did not realize for there everything is a new experience every time .,art
and i know there were ups and down but you guy are the best .,art
you were some of my best friend .,art
and some of the best people i know .,art
and i want to thank you .,art
and i want to thank the viewer too because if not for you and if not for your love for the original apple sleep none of this would have even been a thing .,art
i wouldnt have been able to bear my soul creatively in the medium that you wouldnt expect from me .,art
but yeah i i am honored every single day to be magpypony and to know all of you .,art
and thats all i want to say .,art
all i am going to have to give you snuggle when we are done .,art
you were the cat .,art
and on that note i think that is it .,art
thank you all for listening .,art
i want to thank all the artist how meg wa saying earlier .,art
the biggest reason why these production are even able to be a good a they are is because of you guy .,art
and i i yeah i am forever grateful for this .,art
it blow my mind that much talent is is willing to help u make these vision come to life .,art
and it is it it blow my mind every day .,art
but yes let let go down the list for a while .,art
is everybody cry ?,art
did i not have everybody say goodbye ?,art
it is going to be bye .,art
it is this mean the world to me .,art
welcome to the michael singer podcast presented by sound true in partnership with shanti publication .,art
for more information about michael singer work access to all prior episode and information about upcoming release we invite you to join u at www.mickelsingerpodcast.com .,art
people think that making themselves feel big seem big make something bigger themselves is a way to find being peace happiness in life .,art
a truly great being and well get the gap in between know that being nobody is the most beautiful thing in the whole universe .,art
it is total freedom .,art
now it depends on how you mean and how you get to being nobody because nobody want to be nobody .,art
they get mad at me when i talk this .,art
my psychiatrist and therapist teach me to think highly of myself and to be positive etc .,art
and then you tell me to be nobody .,art
it is subtle and we talk about it .,art
why not ?,art
if you want to be somebody and you practice being nobody it is tremendously unhealthy because you are suppressing the part of you that want to be somebody .,art
if you want to impress people and you try not to you try to practice humility thats false humility that you want to impress people .,art
especially if you think by looking humble you are impressing people .,art
you hear me ?,art
thats not whats meant by becoming nobody .,art
whats meant by becoming nobody is that there is nothing inside of you that want to be anybody .,art
you are not somebody who want to say to me it is very beautiful to watch her grow but she want to say to me when she wa in college she decided she wanted to be average because it is safer .,art
she wanted to prove herself .,art
she doesnt always feel that shes being challenged .,art
this particular person wa very brilliant very smart very competent human being but she wa busy being average .,art
because it wa safer .,art
it is a safe place to be .,art
you are not trying to impress people because then you might not impress them .,art
then you feel bad .,art
if you are happy being average then nobody judge you .,art
these are the trick of ego that we are going to talk about them because they interfere with your spiritual growth .,art
wanting to be nobody is not the same a being nobody .,art
wanting to be somebody but practicing humility is not the same a becoming the nobody i am talking about .,art
if you get to the point where youve seen enough experienced enough they call it being done you are done .,art
you are not tired of it .,art
you havent had enough of it .,art
no thats not being done .,art
thats i want more but i know i can not have it go away .,art
i want to be alone .,art
thats not being alone .,art
thats being afraid of being with people .,art
thats not being comfortable interacting .,art
there a deep state in which youve seen enough .,art
you do not read a book .,art
life is your book .,art
youve seen enough and forever for the rest of your resistance .,art
there no reason to impress anybody .,art
that what you get from impressing somebody is a cost because the next time you meet them you have to impress them again .,art
you have to maintain that impression .,art
do you understand that ?,art
a wise being ha gotten past all that .,art
they do not have to try to .,art
they saw enough .,art
if you eat food that make you sick because it taste good eventually you stop eating it .,art
it is not worth it .,art
it is not worth the taste .,art
at some point you are going to find out that impressing people is not anything .,art
it is absolutely nothing .,art
what it doe is give you a cost .,art
you have something to pay back .,art
you go through you do a concert everybody clap .,art
you are nervous to do the next one because they might not clap and youve already built through ego based on the fact that i am somebody people clap about .,art
that go for everything .,art
that go for deciding this is what i want the future to look .,art
these are my dream .,art
these are my hope .,art
these are my view .,art
these are my concept .,art
i talked to you this way because you are mature enough to understand it doesnt mean you do not do thing .,art
it is not about doing or not doing .,art
youve heard that .,art
it is about being .,art
it is about being done that you can stand in the presence of any of this happening and there nothing inside that want anything from it .,art
not that you are not supposed to .,art
not that you should suppress .,art
not that you should renounce .,art
when you were young you played with toy .,art
i usually use barbie a an example .,art
i am glad she came back .,art
all who barbie is now. . but girl maybe some boy also played with barbie. . and you liked barbie .,art
the whole thing wa barbie .,art
whered barbie go ?,art
and the addict somewhere .,art
thats not nice .,art
she wa your best friend .,art
what happened ?,art
you outgrew her .,art
you did not renounce her .,art
you outgrow thing .,art
you see through them .,art
you mature past them .,art
you realize that that wa through giving you .,art
they do not do anymore .,art
you do not need them anymore .,art
thats a very beautiful state .,art
it is called being done .,art
not wanting to be done .,art
not trying to be done .,art
not trying to act somebody who done or not even understanding that done is a very high state .,art
it is a very very good state .,art
what if i am done with relationship ?,art
you got burned you do not have nothing to do anymore ?,art
no thats not done .,art
they say that i am done with that .,art
thats not the done i am talking about .,art
thats the human done not the spiritual done .,art
when are you done with relationship ?,art
when you are done with relationship you are done with barbie .,art
are relationship wrong ?,art
is your toy wrong ?,art
when you grow up ?,art
there nothing wrong or .,art
youve finished that part of your being .,art
it did what it needed to do and now it is not there anymore .,art
thats what done mean .,art
not the done we use the word for .,art
i am done with school .,art
i am done with this job .,art
i am done with this bos .,art
i am done with the politics .,art
i think thats not done in any way shape or form .,art
theyve sat there and said i am not done with it that i can not handle it .,art
is there a difference ?,art
it is important to me and it burn me and i can not handle it .,art
i am done with it .,art
do not use that word done dandron spiritual or yogi a that buddhist because thats not done .,art
done is done is siddhartha .,art
i have gone through this process of life .,art
all of it ha put me through my change .,art
i do not mind if other people feel it .,art
but is not that hollow and dark ?,art
no it is beautiful .,art
it is beautiful to wake up in the morning and realize you are fine and to look and not can not you do not even think about whats going to happen today .,art
and you do not even think about what happened yesterday .,art
you did not expect anything from it .,art
you did not want anything from it .,art
you were here now and walked through the moment a it happened .,art
and when it is done happening it is done .,art
thats what done mean .,art
be here now is the epitome of done .,art
but be here now is not something you do .,art
when that book first came out in the late sixty early seventy you tried to be here now .,art
if you are trying to be here now you are not .,art
trying to be here now is pay attention .,art
focus on it .,art
that mean you are not here now but you are trying to be here now .,art
it is a wonderful thing to do .,art
eventually you are done with that .,art
what doe it mean ?,art
there no other place for you to be .,art
there nothing in your mind thats saying id rather be doing this or i should be doing that .,art
or why did not i do this ?,art
and then you look back on the day and sit there and say what did i get done ?,art
what should i get done ?,art
meaning i am not here now .,art
i am there then .,art
i am not here now .,art
when you are done with it how can you be done with it ?,art
how can you be done with it ?,art
first if you care what other people think of you you will never be done .,art
because you are busy trying to please them or avoid them or justify or defend .,art
you are busy doing something because you are not .,art
and the relationship you have with others is either making you feel better or making you feel worse .,art
and you are not done with that .,art
you are not done with your relationship .,art
i am not talking about close intimate relationship or any relationship .,art
work play school this that driving everything .,art
i wa the example of the driving .,art
someone driving slow in front of you .,art
can you handle that ?,art
are you done with getting upset by the way people drive ?,art
are you done with the weather ?,art
are you done getting upset because it is hot or humid ?,art
or because it is going to storm ? ?,art
have you gone through enough hurricane to where it doesnt mean you do not prepare .,art
it doesnt mean you do not deal with whats here now .,art
but you are not worried anxious scared .,art
you are in harmony with whatever weather unfolds .,art
because you can be with it .,art
youve been with it enough .,art
youve experienced enough .,art
a done mean you are not done with a thing .,art
you are done with your worry about the thing .,art
you are done with your hope and dream and concept and view and fear and desire about a thing .,art
then you are done with it .,art
see the difference ?,art
but if you do not if you have all that stuff going on in there you are not done .,art
you can try to act you are done but you are not done .,art
they are beautiful .,art
done mean you do not even have to talk about it .,art
you do not talk about white line .,art
you are done with them .,art
youve seen yellow one youve seen white one youve seen dotted one youve seen solid one .,art
you are done with them .,art
most day your weather is fine .,art
you do not even think about it .,art
the weather is what it is .,art
it doesnt mean you are not interacting with it .,art
the weather say it is going to rain .,art
it is not that you are not interacting with life .,art
you are not interacting with life with a motive .,art
this is very deep .,art
motivelessness is being done .,art
thats not a word .,art
i think there such a word in the dictionary .,art
there is such a thing in the spiritual dictionary a a very deep state .,art
you have entered into this moment without a motive .,art
not for a second .,art
i am not trying to make it it will make me better later or make up for what happened before or make amends .,art
it is going to chill .,art
it is a very high state .,art
i have no motive for why i am interacting with this moment .,art
are you interacting with it ?,art
i would have to have a motive to not .,art
no by the way god i hope youll listen to me .,art
i am not interacting with it .,art
it is interacting with me .,art
i am interacting with the weather .,art
the weather is interacting with me .,art
it is in charge .,art

i do not need blanket for the cold .,art
thats a motive .,art
you are trying to show how tough you are .,art
thats a motive .,art
god ive never talked to the three guy before .,art
the word motivelessness is a phenomenally deep word from a spiritual point of view .,art
are you getting it ?,art
you have walked into the moment except you did not walk into the moment .,art
the moment came to you .,art
you do not walk into any moment .,art
this is what i do not know why i get this .,art

doe that mean that you are not moving your arm ?,art
have you moving your arm ?,art
did you make the muscle that make your arm move ?,art
at some point you wake up and you realize it is all happening around you .,art
it is happening to you .,art
it is what is from the past inherited into your moment .,art
and then you take that and the other one i give you is here you are having a moment .,art
whatever it is every moment you are having a moment .,art
how big is that moment in relationship to how many moment that are happening at the same time ?,art

how many moment are you missing compared to the one moment you are having ?,art
you are missing .,art
my god there no number big enough is it ?,art
you are missing everything .,art
why do i have to tell you the ego is nothing ?,art
it is a lie .,art
it is a joke .,art
what if you are done with ego ?,art
doesnt mean ego is done with you .,art
you are done with the white line you still see them .,art
you pay attention to them ?,art
but if you are done with ego what if you are the state where anything it say it is ego .,art

yours is not special .,art
everybodys got one .,art
it is hilarious .,art
it mean nothing .,art
you are not trying to get what it want or avoid what it doesnt want or prove yourself to people or make sure that what you want for the future happens .,art
there no blindness going on in there .,art
is ego still there ?,art
but you are done with it .,art
thats why the word done is important .,art
you are not fighting with it .,art
you are trying to change it .,art
you are not denying it .,art
you are not suppressing it .,art
you are not elevating it .,art
you are not proving it .,art
you are not defending it .,art
you understand that ?,art
youve been around the block enough time to see the thing for what it is worth .,art
whats worth ?,art
it is a pain in the butt .,art
all it doe is cause trouble .,art
it is busy wanting and needing and proving and defending it .,art
and you do what it tell you to do .,art
you constantly behave in accordance with this thing .,art
barbie wa a thing this ego is a thing .,art
and you can be done with it .,art
i am trying to teach you it is different than getting rid of it .,art
it is different than it is done talking to you .,art

it may not be insulting to somebody else but it is insulting to you because the way your mother used to talk to you .,art

i call it vomiting. ?,art
the ego vomit into your mind and it go on doesnt it ?,art
and it want you to tell a person off .,art
it want you to make sure it never happens again .,art
people who are not done with your ego do not even know they are defending themselves .,art
they think it is perfectly reasonable logical .,art
how could you say that to me ?,art
somebody who done with their ego realizes the thing is hit .,art
well talk about it in a minute .,art
it is going to do it thing .,art
a snake doe a snake thing .,art
the cloud doe the rain thing .,art
the sun doe the heat thing .,art

it wasnt able to build the mask .,art
wasnt able to build the self concept that let it feel comfortable in there .,art
relatively comfortable in there .,art
it doe that your entire life .,art
it is not when you were little you did that .,art
i extreme example because they wake you up .,art
you are married and you live somewhere .,art
you live in this house .,art
you come home every day from work .,art
this day you come home from work .,art
you are very very happy .,art
turn the corner and somethings wrong .,art
the house is not there .,art
no it wa never there .,art
the neighbor are there no lot .,art
there no place where it wa .,art
i know exactly what you are going to do .,art
you are going to go back out to the street you turned onto and make sure it is straight .,art
there 25th .,art
i am tired or something .,art
i turned the wrong thing .,art
you can see yeah it is 25th .,art
you go turn back there and the house is not there .,art
you go up and knock on a neighbor door where your house used to be a neighbor but now those other neighbor are neighbor to each other because there no house .,art
you knock on the door and your neighbor who your friend come out and say how can i help you ?,art
what are you doing here ?,art
ill tell you not too good because that what you were holding onto which is this is me .,art
this is mine .,art
this is whats real broke .,art
you do not know what to do with yourself .,art
whats going on ?,art
it is only get uncomfortable .,art
there no discussion when thing break that and change that .,art
even little thing not that big .,art
we have trouble do not we ?,art
if all of a sudden you are married to somebody or your friend or somebody or at work and they treat you a certain way the next day they come in and they are treated different .,art
thats hard .,art
it get weird in there .,art
thats ego .,art
thats ego clinging to what it call it norm .,art
it is the selfconcept .,art
this is where everybody belongs and everybodys related to ego .,art
china ha something to do with your ego .,art
because you read it in the paper because somebody told you something because you met a chinese person .,art
a your ego developed this concept about white people and black people and foreign people and you are .,art
you are because you have all this data .,art
everybody ha this .,art
this is your ego .,art
all of it is your ego .,art
do not ever say thats not your ego .,art
thats not a spiritual state .,art
the spiritual state you understand .,art
ive had experience in my life .,art
my daddy taught me this month .,art
this is all your opinion .,art
if you think your opinion are you want to argue with somebody .,art
why is it never argues ?,art
for what purpose ?,art
you are arguing with somebody ego .,art
you are arguing with somebody past .,art
you are arguing with somebody concept and view .,art
why would you bother ?,art
the problem is do yours that way ?,art
do you understand that youve been programmed ?,art
your ego ha been programmed by your past experience .,art
but everybody had different past experience .,art
and tomorrow you are going to have another experience .,art
you can change in a second .,art
ego is nothing .,art
it is nothing .,art
it is absurd that you would build this fake model to make yourself feel comfortable and the only thing that doesnt make you feel uncomfortable is now everybody ha to agree with you .,art
the moment somebody say they say you are wrong with your politics. ?,art
everybodys going to be different .,art
they all had different experience .,art
it is to be strong for the 60 . how can anybody be when everybodys wrong ?,art
it is ridiculous .,art
thats your ego .,art
you think it is you .,art
you think it is worth defending .,art
it is the bane of your existence .,art
what doe it mean to be done with that ?,art
that it is not there ?,art
it is going to be there .,art
psychology say yourself cause of your ego is a summary of learning experience .,art
no but you can watch .,art
you do not this certain religious people or nationality or something that .,art
that always meet somebody or anything about them .,art
and for some reason love happens .,art
you feel this love .,art
and you find out that there are that nationality or that religion which you always poo pooed .,art
and all of a sudden you do not mind it much do you ?,art
love change a lot of thing .,art
all of a sudden you feel way more comfortable and your whole attitude change .,art
and ego is a chameleon that will change in one dillient of a second to anything that make you feel more protected .,art
and it make you feel more comfortable .,art
that sucker change it .,art
now you are getting an understanding of this ego thing but we are lost in it we do not see it a a thing .,art
we see it a me and i am .,art
anytime you say i am boy you aint nowhere .,art
you think you are and do not talk to me that .,art
all that attitude every drop of it is ego .,art
and then people say i have no ego .,art
that is all ego .,art
when you are done with ego somehow it edge .,art
thats all i can tell you .,art
you are back far enough .,art
that do not work .,art
you have been through enough life experience and learned about the stuff going on inside of you and outside to where i am doing my hand .,art
there this little circle in there and the ego fit in that circle .,art
but there all this room outside the circle in which there is no ego .,art
and now youve seen it for what it is the collection of thought that you were lost in and that if it doesnt get what it want boy it wa held to pay .,art
and i guess what it wa .,art
now you are it is being a drug .,art
you are addicted to ego .,art
if i do not have it if it is not getting what it want i am freaking out .,art
i can not live with myself .,art
i can not live with anybody getting what it wants. . thats what drug do .,art
you are addicted to ego .,art
but when you get far enough back naturally by letting go i am telling you it a a collection of thought .,art
you do not think about it .,art
you see it and there all this space outside of it .,art
and eventually you are done with it .,art
you are done with it .,art
it could throw it little tantrum and you do not even pay attention .,art
it is funny .,art
it is not even a meaningful thing that all of a sudden it change what it is thinking about or this or that or somebody my love we are talking about your relationship with the rest of the people in the world .,art
your relationship with the rest of the people in the world is how do i relate to them ?,art
it is an i them situation ?,art
how do i feel about them ?,art
then them could be a single person .,art
how do i feel about that person ?,art
how do i how they treat me ?,art
how do i what they said ?,art
how do i what they are doing ?,art
how do i what they are wearing ?,art
every single thing come back to i doesnt it ?,art
it all come back to i. i once used an example .,art
somebody come in hey man you can not believe it .,art
it is neat all ?,art
what to mine say ?,art
i got one last year .,art
come on watch .,art
it relates everything back to you .,art
because ego is always defending itself it is always building itself it is maintaining itself but we are lost in it that we do not see that and we try to do what it say to do because it is much more comfortable .,art
eventually when you are mature enough in your spiritual growth you get done but they are done with ego is a big thing .,art
it is a very big thing .,art
it is everything i teach you all the time .,art
you can not make it not be ego .,art
do not try to .,art
do not try to make it not relate to itself a the i because thats what ego mean .,art
that which relates to itself a the i. it brings everything back to itself .,art
it doe that .,art
the question is can you handle the different state that ego get in the weather ?,art
it is inner weather .,art
i want you to see it is inner weather .,art
can you handle the wind ?,art
can you handle the rain ?,art
can you handle the heat the cold ?,art
can you handle weather ?,art
can you handle weather ?,art
if you can not handle the weather you can not handle the ego .,art
if you can not learn that the weather is what it is i do not human .,art
it make my hair fizzy .,art
my god it is hot today .,art
all if you can not handle the weather you are going to handle that thing inside the inner weather .,art
thats saying i do not what she said .,art
i do not what shes doing .,art
i do not what she look and i can not believe it .,art
it is judging judging judging comparing constantly the whole thing is not it ?,art
you have to be able to handle and it is not even tolerate .,art
it doesnt mean what you do about it .,art
it ha nothing to do with whether youve been nice to them or killed them .,art
it ha nothing to do with that .,art
the question is can you handle that there are mosquito or they freak you out ?,art
their buzz bother you .,art
you are afraid they got in the house .,art
they are in the car .,art
you can not be at peace in the presence of mosquito .,art
thats what handling mean .,art
i do not have to do anything about it .,art
i am at peace with it .,art
now deal with it .,art
maybe you need to get it out .,art
you need to kill it .,art
i do not care what you end up doing when you are done .,art
thats why you can not judge the behavior of somebody who done .,art
there great master that are done .,art
you do not want to hear because you can not handle .,art
they do not behave the way you think they should .,art
they do not behave that everythings put in box you to put them .,art
i do think a master is .,art
someone who boxed are defined it fit perfectly inside of them and never go outside of them .,art
ha mastered the box game ?,art
a master a true master is someone who done .,art
done with what ?,art
they are done with their ego .,art
they are done with concept view opinion preference hope dream right wrong judgment anything .,art
they are liberated .,art
the ego is a keystone of being done because it is very strong .,art
when it throw tantrum it is very difficult to deal with .,art
therefore you try to interact with people in a way that they you do not you ?,art
you are trying to be accepted in that night .,art
you are trying to create a world trying to create a world that work for you .,art
again it pull it back to me .,art
it is all about me .,art
do i my clothes ?,art
do i how people think about me ?,art
do i my relationship ?,art
do i this ?,art
i i i i i i constantly come back to the eye .,art
being done done with a very rare state is it is not that it is not being an ego .,art
it is that it doesnt even catch your attention the weather .,art
the weather come and go .,art
what are you doing ?,art
this thing come and go .,art
it doesnt make you change anything .,art
it doesnt do a single thing .,art
there are snake there are mosquito .,art
no id say to be fair ive talked about ego .,art
thats the thing in the universe .,art
now i am going to list all the other thing there are .,art
how many thing are there ?,art
eight hundred billion zillion thing .,art
they are what they are .,art
they are what they are .,art
they do what they do and they because they are not in your frame of reference they will affect you .,art
are you judging them all ?,art
are you judging how armadillo behave or kangaroo which youve never seen one ?,art
they are terrible .,art
they carry their kid .,art
what do they call u ?,art
the kid named jimmy ?,art
they carry joey in their little pocket .,art
get that thing inside a womb for god sake .,art
whats the matter with you ?,art
carry a kid in a pocket .,art
do you do that with everything ?,art
then why do you do it with anything ?,art
because it affect your ego .,art
you understand that ?,art
you did not build a concept about joey about the kangaroo or the possum or nor soupy old .,art
but you build the concept about what shes wearing .,art
because of you .,art
build the concept every single thing .,art
get a scale weigh a few pound more or le .,art
how you doing ?,art
nobody ha anything to say about that ?,art
ego can not handle anything .,art
because it built these self concept about itself and it sends everything ha to stay the same .,art
but then it get bored .,art
there no wind .,art
i am going to talk about it .,art
there no wind with ego .,art
if it get what it want it is afraid it is going to lose it .,art
and it get what it want .,art
ive always needed this .,art
it is scared to death of saying something wrong doing something wrong looking .,art
you get older you look in the mirror .,art
i do not look the same a i used to .,art
my god it doesnt fix anything .,art
and you eventually catch on .,art
this is how you get done by noticing this thing is something else .,art
it is not my whole life server nothing .,art
and it is still talking .,art
it is still demanding .,art
it is still complaining .,art
all or wrong .,art
it is still doing it ego stupid thing .,art
try my whole life to make it be .,art
and eventually you look at it and say what ?,art
i can handle the weather in here .,art
do your thing .,art
do whatever you want .,art
i aint doing it out here .,art
but in here you need to throw a tantrum throw a tantrum .,art
you want to get all excited about something ive been there done that seen that .,art
how long is this ?,art
stay excited .,art
how long have you got everything that you wanted and finally came ?,art
how long doe there nothing else before you want something else ?,art
when wa the last time you got what you wanted and you never wanted anything else ?,art
thats what it mean to be done .,art
you are not suppressing .,art
you are not renouncing .,art
when you are done with something whats the person renouncing it ?,art
it is not causing any trouble .,art
it can be here there or sideways around time .,art
and it is fine .,art
thats the state you get when you work with thing .,art
you work with being with thing .,art
because you are not with thing .,art
but work with being .,art
and what will happen is you practice being .,art
you do not realize i can handle the weather .,art
i can handle the heat .,art
i can handle what you said to me .,art
it probably wa because usually it is .,art
and then you got that crap going outside your mind .,art
make yourself miserable .,art
what if somebody say something and you notice your ego start to do this ?,art
you give a little kiss on the head .,art
it is .,art
and it is over .,art
there nothing to do about it .,art
are we getting a feeling for done mean ?,art
how about if you were done with everything ?,art
it doesnt mean you do not do anything .,art
it mean you are not forced to react to the fact that you are not done .,art
how about that ?,art
you have to do something about it do not you ?,art
if you do not the heat you better go go for a house move away from the south go somewhere .,art
you have to do something .,art
you are not done with it .,art
you are not done with the ego .,art
you have to do thing .,art
and most important thing that i am telling you and psychology will teach you this ?,art
is your acceptance .,art
ill ask you how do you feel about being accepted versus rejected ?,art
thats a big test .,art
ill make a psych test for you .,art
you will not want to take it .,art
if you are pretty strong about acceptance do not you ?,art
think about being liked about being accepted .,art
if you are pretty strong about being rejected about being disliked .,art
what if you find out that you heard i heard that mary said that fred heard saul say that paul wa thinking badly about you but you do not know mary .,art
you do not even know paul .,art
it still bother you .,art
do you understand that ?,art
god i wonder if somebody told them something that i did .,art
i want you to get a light on it and see how what a ridiculous thing you are sitting on a little planet spinning a little black empty space caring about somebody thought that somebody thought that somebody said how are you going to ever be ?,art
but you can not change the nature of ego because then you are busy still doing something .,art
it ha to be a with the reaction that ego had to what you said .,art
i can handle it .,art
ive learned to handle it .,art
ive learned there nothing to do about it .,art
itll be what it is .,art
if saul marries joe do not me i do not know whats going to happen .,art
defending yourself i am strong enough to handle .,art
i can handle whatever happened .,art
ive been through my life .,art
ive been thrown up and down and down .,art
my god all kind of stuff going on .,art
i guess i can handle it and ive been letting go of the garbage .,art
i can handle it .,art
now if you can handle it who care ?,art
whatevers going to happen but i am afraid to drive in a car .,art
what if we get in an accident ?,art
your pornorotic person can not enjoy driving in a car .,art
other people do it .,art
whats wrong with you ?,art
grabbing everything jumping everything .,art
and eventually you say what ?,art
who care ?,art
ill learn about doctor and hospital and about broken bone and boy this will be fun .,art
i am done not wanting or wanting or being afraid .,art
fearlessness doe not mean there no fear .,art
it mean you are not afraid of the fear .,art
a human can feel fear .,art
it is another type of weather .,art
it is another thing that can come up inside .,art
i am not afraid of experiencing it .,art
it go everything else .,art
do the difference ?,art
that word somebody say i should never say it by the way but i am done with fear .,art
they think that mean you are fearless or nothing will scare you .,art
no it mean i can handle fear .,art
i do not have to do anything about it .,art
a i always say through the show you love your wife a lot .,art
shes going to die .,art
why would you say that ?,art
what do you mean ?,art
yeah i know .,art
whats going to happen ?,art
whatever happens will you be sad ?,art
whatever happens i can handle sad .,art
i can handle death .,art
that mean you do not feel anything .,art
no i can handle what it feel when these situation take place .,art
done mean i do not have to do anything about it especially not now but it hasnt even happened .,art
what chance do you have in life if you can not handle what you think might happen ?,art
a great being if they can handle the unfolding of the day of their life why would they worry about the future ?,art
thats how you get done .,art
i teach you that .,art
handle this minute then this hour then this day .,art
and the day start to tie together and you realize i can handle them .,art
doe that mean everything went the way you wanted ?,art
of course not but i could handle how it went .,art
i did not bring today into tomorrow and i sure did not bring seventeen year ago into today .,art
i couldnt handle it back then .,art
thing happened .,art
i guess it is hurt .,art
i wasnt assured .,art
what happens now ?,art
it come back up .,art
why doe it come back up ?,art
because you do not have to hold it down .,art
because i am done with holding thing down there .,art
because i am done with me having trouble with thing that happened seventeen year ago that will never happen again .,art
your childhood will never happen again .,art
i do not know why in the world psychology ha to get it out of there and do stuff. ?,art
it doesnt matter because you can not handle it .,art
what happens is you learn i can handle today tomorrow .,art
now all of a sudden i can handle that the past is coming up .,art
whats happening ?,art
i am done holding on to thing .,art
i am done worrying .,art
i can handle whatever it is .,art
i am sitting back here in the witness consciousness .,art
it is all coming up .,art
it is all passing through and i aint stopping the thing with it .,art
i have no motive back to motivlessness .,art
my god if he doesnt me then maybe when i go to get a job hell tell somebody no thats motif .,art
hear me ?,art
i have no reason to manipulate what anybody think about me because i am not looking for anything .,art
but that doe not mean i do not interact with the world .,art
but a beautiful thing to interact with the world with someone who done .,art
it is beautiful .,art
there no noise .,art
there no commotion .,art
but that doesnt mean that somebody not working .,art
doesnt mean somebody not taking their whole .,art
when you are done now you have the and the room to take your entire heart and soul and mind and devote it to the moment thats in front of you because you have no reason to do anything else .,art
thats art .,art
the moment becomes an act of creativity of art .,art
your total being is present in it and there will be much inspiration .,art
there much coming down because you are not in the way .,art
look how much commotion the freaking ego make .,art
if you want to say how they make decision and if somebody teach somebody who done teach you will know when when you need to know because all the force of creation will come together and nobody in the way .,art
and you will be part of the whole and well unfold that way .,art
is it inspiration ?,art
you want to call it that ?,art
what it is is being done .,art
you are out of the way .,art
and then the moment unfold and there no interfering with them .,art
how doe the planet stay in orbit ?,art
who doing that ?,art
how do all your cell in we are back to that .,art
how do all cell in your body talk to each other ?,art
and on .,art
it is that way .,art
it is the nature of thing .,art
everything work except when you are in the way .,art
and you have motif .,art
all of human problem every drop of them is because of motif .,art
because everybodys trying his ego everybodys trying to get thing to be the way they want it to be they feel .,art
boy that will make some serious commotion since everybodys different .,art
these formula are easy .,art
the psychology is and every person is a sum of their learned experience .,art
they are psychies the sum of the learned experience and they are .,art
look at yourself what you what you do not .,art
it is all your past experience building up to your your views. . and everybodys different .,art
now throw them all into a planet together .,art
all eight.five billion of them all completely different because of all the sum of the learned experience how many experience have you had ?,art
and they were different .,art
nobody had the experience you did .,art
now throw them together and instead of having to be done have them be completely not done .,art
they are only if they are getting what they want .,art
they are only if they are avoiding what they do not want .,art
and everybodys different .,art
go on throw them together .,art
tell them how many war they are going to be .,art
tell them what commotion is going to be .,art
tell them how much disturbance there going to be all over the place .,art
you understand that ?,art
thats what it mean being done .,art
you understand that ?,art
you are not part of that .,art
you did not bring that into the show .,art
thats pretty special .,art
all of a sudden le than the peacemaker .,art
you are here and the ego for what it is but that other people do not .,art
what happens ?,art
in my definition of compassion i say it is different than webster .,art
to me compassion is you are done at least in that area .,art
and the suffering that it wa when you werent done .,art
and you look upon others and realize they are not done .,art
and you feel compassion .,art
you understand you do not have to suffer that but i know you do now .,art
what can i do to lift the suffering ?,art
it doesnt mean anything in particular .,art
it mean you understand .,art
it is deep and beautiful .,art
true spiritual state is gorgeous .,art
but i am telling you what it is about is being done .,art
it is not about doing this work or doing that but it doesnt mean you do not do the work .,art
if you are out there being an activist because you can not handle whats going on mausoleum is off good .,art
but you are bringing a much commotion into the world a you are taking out .,art
because there activist on the other side .,art
whatever you are pushing ?,art
if you are done thats how it is .,art
but that doesnt mean that you do not partake in activity .,art
but it is not because you are not .,art
it is because your compassion drive you work with you to work with thing .,art
talked about the deep state of being done .,art
but we also talked about a proplase .,art
it take a whole hour that .,art
because you think i am done with this .,art
i am done with her .,art
that is the opposite of being done mean i am done with this job .,art
thats ego .,art
thats not done .,art
and you get to the point where you understand how doe one get done ?,art
by going through the experience that life put you through .,art
every experience every single experience you have been through and you are going through and you will go through is to help you mature enough spiritually to realize what am i doing ?,art
and i do not want to go back to work .,art
i am trying to cover it .,art
i am talking to the bos .,art
my hand are over it that .,art
you are sitting on a planet in a little nowhere circling around one star at a three hundred billion in one galaxy i wish there were two trillion .,art
and you care about the ketchup on your pant .,art
there ego for you .,art
how would you to be free ?,art
how would you to be free ?,art
not free to do whatever i want .,art
free from that thing that want .,art
they are free to be there .,art
you have no idea how powerful a real being is .,art
everyone else ha got their concept and trying to fit within the box .,art
when they meet someone who they see is not doing that .,art
it is amazing to watch the reactions. . it cause to be that way change them .,art
they have to adjust .,art
theyve never seen such a thing. . he sitting there with ketchup on his pant in a job interview .,art
because he went to lunch and he dropped some ketchup on his pant .,art
but yet he very intelligent and present .,art
i wonder if i could do that .,art
id be embarrassed to say you presented to the world something that doesnt exist .,art
i do not know how to interact with that .,art
i close it up saying you can not make yourself be done .,art
you go through the experience you are going through and let go of what it is thats not done .,art
thats making a commotion out of this stuff .,art
can you handle the moment that happened to you ?,art
the more you can handle the moment that are happening to you the more you will not be afraid that theyll happen again .,art
i would be afraid of that which i handled .,art
are you listening to me ?,art
you do not even by handled passing through .,art
it made it through me .,art
then you are done with that .,art
that build .,art
thats eventually realized i can handle the weather .,art

welcome to st. art the show where we talk about all thing catholic our lady of guadalupe mary and apparition the life of saint art and everything thats happening in the current world that pertains to those subject .,art
today i have such a wonderful guest .,art
for real she is it is such an honor to have my guest today .,art
and i will let her speak most of the show about what she doe .,art
i met her i will only say how i met her .,art
i went with a friend we have a ministry that we studied .,art
we go and pray to clinic where child are aborted .,art
and we take our rosary and i had a rosary thinking that i wa in front of an abortion clinic and someone come from the back and yell something at me .,art
of course the first thing i thought is someone is coming to attack me or someone is going to say something thats not very nice .,art
and no she wa coming to say welcome what are you doing ?,art
you are praying the rosary .,art
thank you much for coming .,art
why are you praying the rosary ?,art
and we said this is an abortion clinic .,art
and she said no this is a center for pregnancy help .,art
we help woman that are pregnant and that are in an emergency situation are lost need guidance and we take them in and we help them out in such various form and way that i wa very surprised .,art
i went into the clinic they showed me around they did a thorough explanation of everything they do .,art
and without further ado i will introduce you to marta my guest .,art
thank you .,art
thank you much for having me here .,art
it is truly an honor to be amongst woman and people that are watching that respect and love life .,art
and we are all defender of life ?,art
and this is what we are doing at heartbeat of miami pregnancy health medical clinic .,art
we are here to equip woman empower them that they can make an informed decision and give them the two beautiful choice which is helping them have their baby or a plan of adoption .,art
we have all been adopted into god family .,art
adoption is a beautiful option .,art
but unless woman have true choice where is that to choose ?,art
when the only choice that most woman have with an unplanned pregnancy is to end the life of the baby to abort that child .,art
and that is what heartbeat of miami is about helping these woman to choose life for their preborn baby .,art
there something that you said everyone defends life .,art
it is true .,art
everyone defends their own life their loved one life .,art
when we say respect life or honor life it is not for a particular religion or faith .,art
no it is everyone .,art
everyone want to defend life .,art
but it is there some stigma in society that when a pregnancy is unplanned then somehow we have to finish it in some form .,art
and here you are to say no we do not .,art
there are other option .,art
and here we are in this show to speak about hey no you can have a child even if it is unplanned .,art
abortion is unthinkable .,art
unthinkable because woman were not created .,art
we were not created to kill our child .,art
and i understand that thing happen .,art
and there forgiveness because we have a forgiving god when we confess and we ask him to forgive u . he doe forgive .,art
but the bottom line is that there are many woman out there that do not know and have not yet done that .,art
and yet they do not have a way out .,art
they think they do not have a way out when there are place such a heartbeat of miami that are there to help them and to equip them and to empower them and to walk with them .,art
because the majority of woman that have abortion is because they think there is no other choice .,art
there no one to help. . they think that they have no support .,art
they think that abortion is the only option .,art
and what happens for those woman ?,art
how do they find help ?,art
what should they do ?,art
can you recommend the practical way of reaching out for help ?,art
do they google ?,art
what is it that they do ?,art
because i found you by chance .,art
how doe someone that ... i am glad because that mean that god is bringing woman thinking it is an abortion place .,art
and obviously when they come in they find life .,art
they find god .,art
they find woman that are there willing to walk with them .,art
and to them it is why is this free ?,art
and we tell them because people that care for you without even knowing you they love god much that that is why it is free .,art
they help u . they support this mission that we can save your child and save you from the pain of a forever pain .,art
and i can second that .,art
i can speak from my personal experience .,art
i wa saying not only how is this free and you are going to tell u more about that because we have a very general soul with u today .,art
and why is everyone nice ?,art
how can you be nice ?,art
you do not know me .,art
this is ... and that tell you that is a love of god .,art
that is truth with a capital letter .,art
that is the truth .,art
you feel that you are with people that are there trying to help you and not trying to sell anything .,art
they do not belong to ... they do not have an agenda .,art
thats how what i felt when i went in .,art
martha did not tell me that .,art
i did not read this in a book .,art
i am not theorizing .,art
thats how i felt .,art
i encourage everyone that know there ha a family member a friend encourage them to find these clinic because this show is nationwide and they see u in all of the united state .,art
and your clinic are in south florida correct ?,art
heartbeat of miami pregnancy health medical clinic we cover all of south florida .,art
but there are pregnancy center and clinic all over the united state that are there willing to help these mom that think that there is no other way out .,art
and a woman with an unplanned pregnancy will never need an abortion .,art
a woman with an unplanned pregnancy need that support that yes i am with you and to u we see it every day .,art
in eighteen year almost that ive had this organization i am the founder cofounder and president of this organization .,art
since we started from the very beginning we have seen how many woman have chosen life for their child and over sixty eightzero baby have been rescued from abortion because at heartbeat of miami .,art
and thats one organization .,art
and when we always say please if this is too much we are here for you we walk with them for an entire year .,art
when an entire year if they need u we are there for them .,art
and we always tell them whatever it is there a plan of adoption you can always come back you can we are here for you .,art
none of them have ever come to return the baby .,art
none of them however those that have aborted because there is a percentage over ninety two of chosen life but there is a percentage that ha aborted .,art
and rania they come back they come back with a broken heart .,art
and thats how we refer them that they can receive that healing of postaborted .,art
you provide that help too .,art
there much to unpack here because the it is the narrative in society is respect life and then prochoice and respect life .,art
there much more .,art
why do not we talk about prevention for example ?,art
why do not we talk about how woman suffer after having an abortion ?,art
physically some can not get pregnant again .,art
mentally emotionally .,art
many family are damaged .,art
boyfriend husband exactly .,art
grandparent there there much more to the to choose .,art
it is not a simple a we a society make it seem .,art
i have the to choose .,art
i will terminate my pregnancy .,art
and then something that id to throw out there and maybe see if you have any thought on it is we are living in a time of a lot of awareness for wellness and mental health .,art
last week wa mental health awareness day .,art
and this month we are in the month of respect life and honoring life in all it form .,art
we are not only speaking of the unborn child we are also speaking of older people and people who are ill ?,art
i always say from the womb to the tomb .,art
from the womb to the tomb .,art
we are no one to take anybodys life .,art
and we are within that month .,art
but in this wellness journey that many people many woman are on and many woman and men where doe the hurt the damage that abortion cause u in again mentally emotionally and physically where doe fit in where doe that fit in in this wellness journey ?,art
it is a if i am eating only organic .,art
i am diving into a very a very difficult topic .,art
but here i am doing all these thing the special diet the special nutrition buying organic food .,art
and but then i continue taking these for example these these chemical or these harsh procedure and surgery because it is that that can hurt me permanently .,art
but thats a taboo .,art
and thats not talked about .,art
it is not talked about .,art
it is not talked about in the church .,art
it is not talked about in woman group .,art
it is not talked about in youth group .,art
it is not talked about freely .,art
yet we freely say all other thing .,art
it is easy to say i used to be in drug but now i found god and i am no longer in drug .,art
but but how often do a woman stand up and say i know what you will suffer if you have an abortion ?,art
it is almost the woman with the issue of blood in the bible .,art
she had gone seen old doctor .,art
she had gone through much for twelve year .,art
she wa suffering from a blood issue .,art
we do not know what that blood issue could have been an abortion for all we know .,art
yet she touched the garment .,art
and immediately she wa healed .,art
woman that find themselves with the pain and believe me when i tell you no matter how many woman you say i celebrate my abortion we know that that can not be true .,art
you can not celebrate the death of that baby that at whatever period of time you carried in your womb and you will always have that blood of that baby in your body .,art
it is impossible to say but this is what the world tell them .,art
and they come become i celebrate my abortion .,art
it is not true .,art
those woman are hurting and we have to see them a such .,art
they are hurting .,art
they come from a place of hurt .,art
they come from a place of hurt .,art
and and they they suffer through an abortion and they will i already did it .,art
then they advise other woman thats nothing when inside they are the walking dead because it can not be possible that a woman can celebrate the death of their child .,art
and i know because ive seen them .,art
and when they come back those that have aborted what an honor to be able to point them to god again and to and to tell them there forgiveness for you let find a place you can confess that you can get that healing that you need .,art
and we see that .,art
we see how they are transformed completely by the grace of our lord the grace and mercy .,art
and mercy is not about pointing to the divine mercy .,art
it is about take care take care of yourself make the decision and education .,art
it is educate yourselves .,art
what go deeper go to heartbeatofmiami.org .,art
go to their website go to their instagram account .,art
and you will see real life testimony and situation that happen every day in those clinic and how happy people are .,art
is it hard ?,art
is it easy ?,art
is it hard ?,art
it is le hard with such caring people that provide much tangible help .,art
they provide you with diaper .,art
they refer you to doctor .,art
they help you in every step of the process .,art
and i get goosebump remembering the thing they refer you to doctor .,art
they even sometimes call them and that you their office that they expect you .,art
they walk with you every step of the way .,art
and this is real .,art
this is not fake .,art
this is real .,art
this is truth .,art
this is life .,art
this is love .,art
this is god love and action .,art
these are the eye of the lord .,art
these are the mouth of the lord the hand of the lord the foot of the lord .,art
this is the heart of god because thats the least of these .,art
that tiny baby and the shedding of innocent blood is horrifying. . we shouldnt it is almost a if we shouldnt even be having to do this .,art
we those woman they it would be ideal to have a village ?,art
a family support and to not have to think of this a a first choice .,art
again this is not about blaming anyone .,art
some people out of ignorance out of not knowing out of here .,art
out of fear .,art
out of fear .,art
but there are other option and there are people that help .,art
and i know that sometimes it seems that there no one to help u but we are here to say there are people that help u and please look it up .,art
harp it of miami .,art
harp it of miami and they can if you are watching from another state thats not florida .,art
call u and well speak for you .,art
we have a we have a a directory that all over the world .,art
there are people that are helping woman that they can have their baby .,art
and thats what we are about .,art
and when you said about education education start at home .,art
education is when the parent come and walk with these child and and tell them whats good or bad .,art
oftentimes i say it is that the abortion issue it is a religious issue .,art
and i am going to ask a question to those that are watching u today .,art
is it a religious issue or is it a moral issue ?,art
is it moral to kill another human being ?,art
if we wouldnt allow it in animal ?,art
we do not allow it in animal .,art
we do not allow it in a a human you can not kill another human being. . but they but then there the argument of the clump of cell .,art
is it not ?,art
. . and scientist know that that it is life .,art
of course science ha proven it is human .,art
but it is they can not it is we are we are i am being perhaps extreme or some people may not to hear it .,art
it is a if we are caught in this in this narrative that society imposes on u . and then we do not we are this is a calling to think beyond that .,art
jesus wa a rebel in a way .,art
and he he invited u to always seek the truth .,art
and thats the invitation to seek the truth .,art
is it is it to say that an animal that is expecting their offspring is expecting whatever puppy for example in the case of a dog but a woman a woman that who pregnant is expecting a clump of cell .,art
why are we with the animal world perhaps but not the human ?,art
these are the deep question that are not that deep that are basic and that we have to ask ourselves .,art
and in africa i heard that the word abortion doesnt exist for example there no translation for the word abortion because it is unfathomable unthinkable that there no word to say it .,art
why would a mother seek to of course there are certain situation but not a a society a a whole .,art
and i think that i think that also we have to think about in this education that we are speaking of we have to think about prevention .,art
what do you think about prevention ?,art
thats a thats a very good question .,art
and and now i am speaking not only to young lady but to woman in childbearing years. . prevention .,art
is there anything that can prevent ?,art
are there any condom for the heart ?,art
there are no condom for the heart .,art
first and foremost i am to these woman that are talking about prevention when god say to wait for marriage he knew what he wa saying because the majority of the men that their girlfriend or whatever have a nonplanned pregnancy they are wanting to run away .,art
thats the bottom line .,art
and and prevention is education .,art
when you look at this young man that you are in love with and crazy about do you think that thats the one that you want to father your child ?,art
because the bottom line is that thats the bottom line .,art
one and one is two .,art
and then a man and a woman get together and they have an intimacy and i am sorry but not whatever birth control you want to pull out of your hat .,art
it is not a hundred percent effective .,art
but first and foremost the heart whats going to happen to your heart ?,art
it get trampled on .,art
it get and then it becomes easier for another partner and another partner and another partner .,art
and that is when we have to come to the truth of saying is this what god want for me ?,art
did god create me for this ?,art
thats when we have to choose .,art
thats when we have to choose .,art
thats when we have to choose .,art
did god create me for this relationship ?,art
is this the man thats going to take me to the altar to be his wife and the mother of his child ?,art
this is what we need to think about because how many time in a night of whatever woman get pregnant even if it is the first time .,art
what i am trying to say is that prevention i do not know .,art
i think that the only prevention is wait for for god to show you the man thats going to be your husband the woman that is going to be your wife .,art
thats prevention and his word is not light and i know that people say everyone is doing it .,art
ive got news for you .,art
not everyone is doing it .,art
there are woman that are saving themselves and there are men that are waiting for that woman that god ha for them .,art
and there an order of thing ?,art
and it is being logical and strategic even .,art
again it is not religion .,art
it is being strategic .,art
would i be undergoing surgery and hurting myself hurting someone else a baby and whatever community or having it ?,art
would i be ?,art
then this is how i am going to act .,art
it is one thing lead to the next .,art
it is not rocket science but in today world one feel we are stepping on egg and we have to be politically correct but it is common sense .,art
but we have to speak truth .,art
we have to speak the truth and it is common sense .,art
because if it is the law of cease or the law of god a for me and my house we are going to serve god and speaking truth ?,art
we are not condemning anyone .,art
we are speaking truth .,art
speak the truth .,art
educate yourself .,art
whatever happens well deal with it but let speak with truth .,art
and tell u about the gala .,art
youve had a gala recently .,art
i wa fortunate to have been able to go to attend .,art
and i will also share this with our audience .,art
i wa surprised .,art
i couldnt believe i wa among hundred of people that were there again in a society that you feel against the grain or you feel you have to stay quiet .,art
and these there were politician .,art
there were mi future mi universe there .,art
there were common people myself .,art
there were all sort of people giving face and showing up for something that is politically incorrect .,art
and a a you all know a a nonprofit it is very difficult to raise fund especially for a cause that is not very popular ?,art
because people think that thats her problem .,art
or i am prochoice or whatever the case may be it is very difficult to raise fund for such an organization .,art
however because god wa the one that opened these door .,art
we started in two thousand and seven .,art
and when we opened our first clinic and now we have five clinic five .,art
we survived the economic meltdown of two thousand and eight two thousand and nine .,art
we survived covid by his grace and mercy .,art
i always say his divine mercy ha brought u to this point .,art
and opening the last clinic in not the last because we only got know how many he going to open in the future .,art
but opening the homestead location it wa such a challenge because it had been in our heart for long .,art
and then all of these happened we had four clinic at that time .,art
and then the homestead location i knew about the sexual traffic .,art
and to be able to be there now and be a part of a community that is being helped finally .,art
and we are teaching these woman how valuable their heart is and how valuable they are and to u . and thats what we do at all of our clinic .,art
but there wa such a deep need in this party in all the one we have but this location there wa nothing from the kendall location to the homestead location .,art
it wa a big drive and there wa nothing there .,art
that help u serve the key a . now we are from the key to broward pretty much helping woman in all the south florida .,art
we have the one in hialeah .,art
that wa the first one that used to be an abortion business by the way in the early 80 . then we had the north we have the north miami clinic which serf a beautiful community .,art
then we have the kendall location which is next to a college .,art
all of them are very close to high school and college .,art
a the abortionist open near high school and college .,art
then we have we opened the one in little havana that wa an abortion business for over twenty eight year .,art
and they close the abortion .,art
thats the one you went to .,art
and they closed and we opened .,art
and now these two clinic that were a previous abortion business are lifesaving clinic .,art
clinic that are transforming the life of woman and saving the life of baby .,art
then the one in homestead which opened a year and a half ago .,art
and i get this joy in my heart .,art
the joy of the lord in my heart because to know that this can only be by his grace and his divine mercy .,art
because this is supernatural that we have been able to do this during these difficult time .,art
our fundraiser is that big event which is the gala .,art
and a you saw it wa a very beautiful taste .,art
it wa very with humble mean if you will .,art
and the people that sponsored it that we could have it .,art
but you saw how beautiful the beautiful venue .,art
it wa all precious .,art
but what make for u a successful gala wa god glorified in that process .,art
you are saying the gala wa gifted in a way to the heartbeat of man ?,art
it is not that it is gifted by people by u selling the dinner people sponsoring .,art
it is not cheap or inexpensive to have a high quality gala god deserves ?,art
he deserves the best .,art
when we bring these woman you saw there were three woman that were previous patient of heartbeat of miami that were there with their baby .,art
one of them wa sitting at my table .,art
it wa a miss cuba .,art
the audience no cuba hasnt had a miss universe in about fifty something year .,art
and now it is happening .,art
and one of the miss cuba went to the clinic .,art
do you want to tell u about that ?,art
her testimony is public .,art
and she wa planning on having an abortion .,art
she came to have an abortion .,art
and it wa beautiful because in one of our gala she and her and her husband testified and we were able to help her see the beautiful life that she wa carrying .,art
and you met that baby .,art
yes i had him in my lap and she went and what wa amazing is that it is love ha a expansive power ?,art
it is contagious .,art
she wa she went to heartbeat of miami .,art
lovingly they explained what her option were how they were going to help her .,art
and she ended up having her baby and it is her life .,art
it is her life and her husband life .,art
he adores that baby .,art
it is a beautiful family .,art
she adores the baby .,art
she brought the baby to the gala very behaved .,art
and she brought all of the other her friend her comiss cuba that are candidate to be miss universe .,art
and how transformative is that ?,art
because it is a form of education because now all of those girl all of those woman that attend many of these event that usually prolife or respect life is not spoken of .,art
and somehow they are ambassador to the happiness that life and the family bring .,art
and thats what this young lady did .,art
she in other word she told them about her story .,art
they chose heartbeat of miami to help heartbeat of miami .,art
and it wa amazing the way that these girl said i had no idea .,art
i thought that maybe an unplanned pregnancy would break my life forever and meeting her and meeting that baby .,art
we understand now and knowing what you do .,art
i think that education is all you said .,art
and we would to touch on the topic of something very important .,art
very important .,art
i would to discus that if we can .,art
yes of course the amendment four .,art
can you tell u whats happening ?,art
what is it that they propose ?,art
yes amendment four it is this same thing is happening in other state a . sadly in the state that ha passed the worst ha happened .,art
and i am going to be truly transparent .,art
please do not be deceived .,art
this the way that it is reading written it is deceitful .,art
and they are making you believe that it is something good for woman .,art
amendment four will be horrible .,art
horrible for our life .,art
horrible for woman .,art
this is not helping woman .,art
amendment four and i pray and please help me pray and fast that it doe not pas .,art
it will be abortion until the moment of birth .,art
if a health professional which is not identified a health professional can be a nutritionist a coach a mental a health whatever the case may be not necessarily a physician an md say you can have an abortion .,art
you should have an abortion .,art
whatever the case that woman can have an abortion up to birth .,art
talking about parent consent parent that are listening to me now your child thirteen fourteen year old can go and have an abortion and you will be notified but you do not have to give a consent .,art
this would be horrific for our for our life for our community for our community .,art
and to me the way that it ha been written is deceitful .,art
and commercial there a lot of money from the opposition that is being spent on this in favor of amendment four .,art
voting yes for amendment four will end the life of thousand and thousand of innocent baby .,art
and also who ha the authority to end the life of this child at the moment of birth when there are parent that are praying to be able to adopt a child ?,art
please please vote no on amendment four .,art
call your your family call your friend and explain to them the danger of this amendment passing .,art
i encourage you to please pray a lot because let me tell you life a we know it it will not be anymore .,art
no and also what what could possibly happen after this ?,art
you are taking away your right a a parent to your child of your child .,art
i think mother teresa said mother mother teresa of calcutta if we can do this to human life whats there what what is left for u to do ?,art
it is the most sacred thing .,art
we are treating it a if it were disposable .,art
we are tearing family apart .,art
yes if you not only if you respect life if you care about life if you care about your faith if you care about truth but also if you care about the right of parent .,art
and this show is about our we always pray to our lady of guadalupe .,art
she is the patroness of the unborn .,art
always pray to her for guidance and we defend family .,art
family and we will speak about this a the show go on but in her eye the latest discovery is that in the iris of our lady of guadalupes eye is a family and in the center of that family is a woman .,art
what we are talking about here today is woman in the center of society family a the basis of society a a nucleus a an important nucleus who going to be there in your best and worst time usually your family .,art
it is a if once again this hidden agenda that i would love for you to maybe you have some word on that but it is a if we are family being attacked constantly and by attacking the woman family is being attacked .,art
the hidden agenda is taking away the right of parent and then of course once the right of parent will be taken away then what ?,art
whats going to happen ?,art
who going to guide these child ?,art
the other thing is taking away the right of the father not eliminating the men and putting them to the side with nothing .,art
and now we come to the mother destroying the woman destroying her heart piercing her heart with the death of her child .,art
i am telling you that this agenda is horrific is to end life a we know it .,art
life a we know it i agree .,art
thank you much marta for this .,art
please keep this in mind when you hear of amendment four tell your friend speak to family member do not be afraid to speak about these clinic that help .,art
do not be afraid to speak up .,art
i think we all have to be a little more braced .,art
we have an example of bravery here marta .,art
yes if you have a clinic thats awesome but partner with a clinic near you that you can help out .,art
be the help that she need .,art
maybe compromise i will help you in this material way shape or form or ill be there for you ill call you every day .,art
there many way we are called to do we are called to spread the gospel and spread which is the word of love .,art
and we all have it is not let wash our hand i do not have a clinic i do not know of anyone by speaking up by doing the small thing we can reach a large audience .,art

welcome to art2heart the podcast where we explore the intricacy of life canvas how to express redefine and embrace our journey through art and conversation .,art
i am your host reena and today we are diving deep into the transmissive power of starting over .,art
whether you are facing a career change moving to a new city or seeking a fresh chapter in your life this episode will help you paint a new picture of whats possible .,art
starting over is not about change it is about renewal creativity and courage .,art
let create something beautiful together in today canvas .,art
i saw this illustration in penetras and i thought this relates much to what we are currently in our life .,art
let start by acknowledging something important .,art
change can be uncomfortable .,art
it is easy to feel stuck you are on a treadmill going nowhere but the truth is sometimes change is exactly what we need to grow .,art
you should come out of your comfort zone .,art
you should be out there in rain in sun to seek what you are built for .,art
imagine standing at a crossroad where every path is unfamiliar .,art
the fear of the unknown can be paralyzing but it is also where opportunity lie .,art
one of the thing i learned from my life is i wa twenty eight once and now i am standing at thirty one and during my peak of my youtube career i stopped posting entirely and took a big break .,art
i never thought that it would take me two long year to come back to start doing what i had enjoyed but at the same time taking care of your health emotion or whatever is happening is very much a priority .,art
of course you may be a part of working culture which is not helpful in following your hobby or in following your dream but at the same time build is something which is daunting every single month every single day of your life .,art
to focus on what is at the current situation we lost ourselves into figuring out what do we want to do but at the same time doing something which is not in your favor doe not mean that you are not doing what you want to do .,art
it is something that you are unstoppable and it is there built in you somewhere that you can become the person you want to and all you have to do is wake up one day and decide no i will start it from today .,art
in your scenario you will definitely be struggling to even think of what you want to do but it is a moment of a second in your brain where you say no i am capable enough to do it and i will do it today not tomorrow .,art
consider these three powerful mindset shift .,art
first from fear to curiosity .,art
replace what if i fail with what can i learn .,art
this simple change open the door to exploration .,art
one thing i did in last december is take up a new design course by google and coursera .,art
it is understanding what the user need from you .,art
thats what i learned in ux design .,art
before that i have no idea whats happening .,art
i would build but do i know what is something which i should look forward to .,art
thats when after doing the course of the certification of ux design i understand it is an empathy .,art
it is a brainstorming .,art
it is an idea which make people to stay longer in your website and take that call to action button .,art
something you learn without even realizing .,art
it is been over eight month nine month since i started implementing this and i still do not have a particular portfolio on that course .,art
despite i should have built two or more website or two or more design i have not done because i am still in the process of learning but doe not stop me from not learning something .,art
the point from fear to curiosity rather than feeling yourself you can stumble upon open that page take up the course and start learning without even thinking further .,art
number two is from isolation to connection .,art
seek out community whether online or in person .,art
youll find others who are also on the journey of reinvention .,art
i can relate to this from the above example about ux design .,art
it is more a notion but also it is much more simpler and much more easier and i happen to attend there .,art
there have been hour where he talked about how you can make few change in your portfolio and you will end up getting job .,art
last and number three from perfection to progress .,art
notice the idea it is to be imperfect every step forward no matter how small is progress .,art
now let get practical here are ten actionable step to help you start over with confidence .,art
number one reflect and define your goal .,art
take time to understand what you truly want journal about your passion and dream .,art
journaling is something which is such a game changer for anybody who ha been doing it is you pinning down your feeling and taking away all those negative thought out of your brain and focusing on the thing you want to focus .,art
number two create a plan .,art
break down your goal into manageable step having a roadmap can make the journey le overwhelming .,art
i said journaling is a key point and everyone should have a dirty notebook or some of the scribble notebook but you can write whatever you are going through and then you will get all the gut and then you will be focusing on the good .,art
number three build a support system .,art
surround yourself with people who uplift and inspire you do not be afraid to lean on them when time get tough .,art
number four celebrate small domain .,art
every little achievement count acknowledging your progress no matter how many are .,art
i am someone who always think of celebrating too long is absolutely madness and being sad too long is also absolutely madness .,art
celebrating those if you are going to celebrate for ten minute you have to feel sorrow for ten minute but our brain doe not work further .,art
we celebrate for ten minute and we keep on thinking of the thing we have not achieved for ten hour and ten day .,art
if you are someone who do not see your progress write it down at the beginning of the month and see at the end of the month how far you have come you will see a difference in it and you will be happy for what you have done .,art
you should not do to seek approval from other but rather from yourself because you are your own best critic out there .,art
number five stay open to new opportunity .,art
life is unpredictable embrace the unexpected twist and turn .,art
if you have lost your job no worry you can upskill yourself go to a better job and where you feel feel accomplished for what you have done .,art
number six practice selfcompassion .,art
be kind to yourself during this transition .,art
acknowledge your feeling and allow yourself to grieve what you are leaving behind .,art
number seven learn continuously .,art
this is my favorite bit .,art
invest in yourself through course book or workshop .,art
knowledge can empower you to make informed decision in your new journey .,art
number eight visualize your future .,art
in time imagining what your ideal life will look .,art
visualization can clarify your goal and motivate you to take action .,art
we all do this mistake .,art
focus on your own journey rather than comparing yourself to others .,art
everyones path is unique and thats what make it special .,art
there are few in our class or in our college who have achieved more than what we are doing today .,art
stop comparing because they have already put that number of effort .,art
for example if you took at ali abdal he started working from the age of fourteen .,art
now he thirty and i can not compare to him saying hey i am elder than ali and i have not done what i have done but looking at his work experience he ha been working for pretty good of a two decade close by .,art
what if i look at my own and not even work for five year down the road .,art
whatever you put in your hard work thats where it will .,art
number ten stay flexible .,art
be willing to adapt your plan a you learn and grow .,art
flexibility can lead to new opportunity you had not considered .,art
flexibility doe not mean you are not going to become the person you have trimmed off but it is becoming the best version of yourself which you have not trimmed off because you are constantly building up yourself .,art
never starting over is not about erasing the past it is about building a future that aligns with who you are now .,art
embrace the journey trust the process and do not be afraid to redefine what success look for you .,art

very thank you .,art
it wa lovely seeing you and the family yesterday .,art
yeah it wa a lovely day did not we ?,art
it wa very very nice .,art
weather wa kind to u and it wa ... canterbury wa bustling wasnt it ?,art
expected christmas but it wasnt quite christmasy enough for me but i spoke to this a bit early yet .,art
yeah halloween first .,art
yes thats .,art
yes but your two little one were absolutely charming .,art
they charmed the pant office .,art
they were on good form yesterday on good form .,art
still on the way out of having this bug thats gone round .,art
we are both but barnabys still on his way out of that .,art
it is stuck around a little bit .,art
it is gone round u multiple time .,art
but we are ... yeah we are doing .,art
tired obviously .,art
tired for the foreseeable .,art
it is tricky is not it ?,art
this thing steve it drain you .,art
especially when youve got the four of you all suffering .,art
it is nice though when it subsides and you are back to normal .,art
life get back to a it wa and especially with the two little one .,art
there lovely moment in every day where even though it is one of them or both of them are not there still lovely moment in the day that make you laugh and make you smile .,art
this week weve got a couple of thing to talk about .,art
weve got the lion to show and you finish that .,art
well talk about that .,art
and then we also had a request on our facebook group which i thought would be interesting to get your advice and get your advice live to see what you think .,art
let start there .,art
ange on facebook on our private facebook group and you can join that .,art
everyone can join that .,art
youve taken one of your class .,art
all youve got to do is go to colin bradley school of art student on facebook and request to join .,art
and then one of the one of the team will approve your request .,art
but i am going to flash up anges picture on screen because ange asks your advice and anyone el advice in the group about background for these cat .,art
ange say i have put the smaller cat closer to the bigger cat and i have included the treat ball .,art
i can not make my mind up whether to leave it a is on the sand past the mat and include the shadow .,art
what doe anyone think ?,art
and you dad shes a bit stumped on this one .,art
it is a very tricky one .,art
i would have tended to do each cat separately .,art
thats what i would have done because when you put two cat together and never quite or two animal together come to that it never quite work a you want it .,art
one and the other one not .,art
what i did with this particular picture you will not be able to see the original because ive cut that down a bit .,art
it wa a larger photograph .,art
what i did is i chopped it to what there a being a reasonable picture .,art
what i would probably have done if it wa possible i would be able to do it is to move the cat on the the one above the ball over slightly nearer to the cat not nearer to the camera on the same distance move it slightly .,art
there a little le and then you can make it a portrait rather than that .,art
i think thats what ang is done .,art
yeah she need to do it more .,art
she need to push it over a bit more in the same a i say do not bring it any nearer because it will look silly .,art
thats what i would do .,art
you can do everybodys got the choice to do what they want to do .,art
i probably would keep the ball in there especially where it is .,art
id probably keep that .,art
now what about the background ?,art
i wouldnt do that background at all .,art
i would do probably it depends if you fancy doing that carpet .,art
yeah do the carpet .,art
but i think i would probably make it that ready tone .,art
there a ready tone in the carpet is not there ?,art
and i did make it that tone all over .,art
and i would probably use the angle .,art
the angle of that cabinet behind the way it cut across at an angle .,art
id keep that angle and then i would perhaps put a skirting board in something that and then make it a plain background .,art
and that background could be that i do not know what it is on the very hand side youve got .,art
thats a speaker i think .,art
is it i quite that colour not the surround the colour .,art
if you made it that colour and then maybe a white or a creamy skirting board .,art
it is got a grey colour this grey colour in the middle .,art
if you look at it it go very with the animal tone wise .,art
i wouldnt make it any darker than that id make it that colour .,art
i am saying what i would do steve but that would be my suggestion .,art
it is a tricky one .,art
it is a complicated picture to figure out because there much going on in that background that you are it is the thing to change it .,art
there is a much much much more complicated one .,art
do you want me to tell you what it would be if it wa me ?,art
what i would do is move the big cat and put it where the other cat is and the other cat where the big cat wa in other word swap them over .,art
but i wouldnt do that id leave the big cat a it is and the small cat id turn it and twist it around .,art
you can do that on the computer you can twist it around .,art
that small cat is looking this way and the other one go there .,art
but thats very complicated and i wouldnt suggest ... who is it ?,art
i wouldnt suggest ang doe that .,art
thats much too complicated .,art
but i could do it .,art
but thats entirely up to her .,art
i would probably advise her to stay a it is .,art
stay a it wa but id move it .,art
but id move that cat slightly closer but not closer nearer to the cat but at the same distance away .,art
i hope that help .,art
yeah interesting .,art
would you include the shadow that are at the bottom ?,art
youve got to because of the lighting of the cat .,art
the cat is lit from almost above there .,art
if you elongated the shadow it would look silly .,art
if you left it out it would look even worse .,art
youve got to put them in .,art
thats good advice .,art
i hope thats helpful ang and obviously others that are watching .,art
it is always interesting to see your advice on a picture and what you would do .,art
and i know thats helpful for others too .,art
let show a couple of stage .,art
we were talking about the lion last week and this is the stage that we showed last week .,art
this is the latest that we had .,art
i thought id remind everyone where you were at .,art
obviously you are putting that background in a a you go along which is a new thing for you because you used to do what you do background last .,art
you can see why i did that can not you ?,art
because youve got a brilliant contrast and you understand that contrast .,art
thats the reason i did it .,art
that wa the colour the original colour .,art
i havent turned much about without that .,art
thats more or le exactly .,art
i may have played with the colour a little bit in term of using the one hundred and seventy five particularly .,art
i think i used oneseven to start with there which is in the animal and one hundred and seventy five which is in the animal .,art
the only two colour i used on that background all the way north i did put a grey on .,art
i think i put a grey on first sorry about that .,art
you can see that grey .,art
if you look on the lefthand side on the edge of the dark background shadow there you can see a bit of grey .,art
youve got a grey pastoral paper i do not know if you use a dark grey pastoral paper .,art
you can see a little bit of that grey .,art
and of course the question would be why do you want that on ?,art
what do you want that for ?,art
you do not have to have that .,art
i do to have something to work my dark colour into and that neutral grey which is two hundred and seventy three thats the colour i wa using .,art
it give it a much richer look .,art
those are the colour that i used .,art
but it is not an easy one this .,art
and thats the reason i did it a youve seen it there .,art
and i think the next one where we show it is even more bitty but i can explain that away i think when we come to watch .,art
you could see this jump a fair bit in term of progression there .,art
all of that background is in .,art
there wa silly doing one little bit in the end .,art
i had to put the i did not have to put it but i decided to put the dead tree in .,art
and the reason is again that link up with the animal and the background .,art
but when i did it subsequently when the last picture ive got that wa a bit light .,art
it wa brighter than that on the original photograph i pulled it down a little bit but i still felt that that wa a bit bright the top part of that wa a bit bright .,art
but you can see here and the reason i put this in you can see the ivory on the animal .,art
it is not going to end up that but you have to put those colour in .,art
there two or three colour there .,art
i can not remember them all .,art
sorry i know it wasnt long ago i did it but i can not remember them now but i know that i used the ivory and i used the grey .,art
the grey i wa using there wa the two hundred and seventy which is an earth grey .,art
and then i used another one a creamy colour i can not remember it wa .,art
i think it wa a one hundred and two i think .,art
anyway the idea wa to try to do exactly the same reason why i did the background and talking about putting a base colour in .,art
i had to put that base colour in and you can see if you look at the pour on the left that wa the same colour a that .,art
you can see that while ive done this ive used a bit of ochre one hundred and eighty seven i think i wa using there a a the two hundred and seventy three .,art
but you can see it beginning to come now .,art
is that finished on the left hand side ?,art
is that pour finished ?,art
yes to all intent and purpose .,art
i did work a little bit more on it but you could say that it is finished .,art
it look good it look finished .,art
and you can see that the build up of that main or the chest a and how you get it .,art
is it the next stage ?,art
let me try and show you it .,art
do not move it yet .,art
id to point out to you is that forward pour ?,art
you are looking at that first we are looking at that first .,art
i wa going to show the difference between doe it go from this and then you immediately make it that .,art
doe that look thats a lot of work to get it from that to that ?,art
not a much a you think .,art
no not a much a you think .,art
because i am using two dark colour there remember .,art
i am using the one hundred and seven and one hundred and seventy five .,art
and then there also a little grey that i put on top of it .,art
the light grey is added afterwards .,art
no it is not a hard a you think .,art
people will see that .,art
it is not easy to put it that way .,art
you were going to talk about the front pour .,art
yeah i am looking at that .,art
when the picture in a minute or two i hope that youll be amazed at the way that pour look a though it is resting over the tree .,art
detail that weve got there .,art
but if you look at it that it start off and then you lose it .,art
yeah it curl around it .,art
now that is critical to this .,art
if i hadnt done that it wouldnt have looked .,art
but i wa particularly pleased with this the way this came up .,art
yeah it is this bit here is not it ?,art
thats it .,art
it is the fact that it is hidden there .,art
that is the key to making it look .,art
it wasnt until afterwards steve that i realised that when i saw it at the end because i wa working on it and working on it and working on it going back and forth .,art
but it is that that i think that i got the most surprised pleasure out of .,art
because when i saw it when you look at it there it wa a bit in a couple of few little dark spot for the claw and a bit of white background .,art
but when that on the next shot .,art
let show the finished picture .,art
see what ? .,art
i see you can imagine you are flopping your arm down .,art
little thing that give me a lot of pleasure .,art
much to mention .,art
this skin these skin ripple fold .,art
no it is hard to believe is not it ?,art
it is hard to believe that that wa the colour .,art
remember that bright yellow colour ?,art
but once you put those colour ive told you about them .,art
there quite a lot of colour on that .,art
and also this section down here .,art
how do you make that happen ?,art
i can not explain it to you .,art
it is you there is very very little colour in there .,art
youve got i use a bit of white a bit of light grey the medium grey and the one hundred and seventy five .,art
but is not very much more than that .,art
i put a little bit of pink in and touch a brown in but not to speak of .,art
but that if i hadnt put that in that poor look doth wouldnt it ?,art
it would have silly flopped in the front .,art
you have to put you have to put the detail in .,art
i love the lion .,art
i think he look amazing .,art
but this is interesting .,art
the tree this section down here the lion is obviously the feature of the picture .,art
but man i want to see how you do all of these section .,art
because i do not i do not think ive seen you do something particularly at this level of detail and intricacy to get such a variety .,art
ive seen you do tree trunk and stuff but there many interesting part to this this tree that i think is fascinating .,art
the secret is the color of the paper .,art
you can see the color of the paper on the outside edge the dark green testament .,art
if i hadnt had that it wouldnt have worked a . id have had to put lot of lot more color on lot of base color .,art
but if you look at that gray especially the area on the lefthand side there you can see that if you put a little bit of gray on thats some two seven three eye i think then .,art
two seven three a little bit of one seven five .,art
youve got that color .,art
it is not a easy a that of course but thats all i did .,art
and then put a little bit of light gray and white of course touch white in there .,art
you do not put white too much underneath .,art
you put the you add the white a you are going along .,art
unlike the line where i said youve got to put a base color you do not have to with this. . you are using the color of the paper a your foundation .,art
and you get it work a if i use any other color paper .,art
such a good picture .,art
how would you rate this in term of difficulty ?,art
you said it wa a hard one earlier .,art
i would say it wa very hard steve .,art
very hard .,art
people that tackle this are going to want a middle at the end of the day .,art
there many thing that can go wrong .,art
even in the simplicity of that tree trunk or tree dead tree i call it the simplicity of that is hard .,art
you wouldnt think it .,art
ive only four color .,art
five if you include a little bit of white going back in .,art
but it is the way you hold the pencil .,art
it is the way you drag the pencil .,art
it is the way you stop .,art
once you achieve the effect thats it .,art
the only thing i did do remember i did say that i darkened that tree on the top .,art
it wa quite bright on the original photograph .,art
but i wanted it to darken .,art
but i wanted it to be faithful to the original photographic reference .,art
and of course that area which i remember when we were talking about it it wa a week before last wa it ?,art
and i said that tail i couldnt understand what that wa at the back .,art
the tail and that area to the hand side .,art
it wa the original picture show it .,art
i havent got that here with me at the moment .,art
but that tail and i said to what i am going to do is extend the tree trunk that we lose that bit of tail .,art
you can still see a bit of it sticking out there but not very much of it .,art
but it wa confusing .,art
and those are the little thing that you can do when you do something this .,art
it doesnt alter the picture very much and it is fairly easy to do a . fantastic .,art
and it feel an audiovisual picture that you filmed that a a class .,art
that will be up on the website in the future people can learn to draw this one .,art
i am working on another picture at the moment the white tiger i think you did at the beginning of the year .,art
that one is about halfway through editing that one .,art
it shouldnt be long before that one come out another line .,art
but yeah great job on that dad .,art
i think it is fantastic .,art
have you thought about another picture ?,art
you thought about what you might do next ?,art
ive got four lined up .,art
i could change my mind on some of them but there two dog and two cat .,art
ive evened it off .,art
all the cat lover were very pleased .,art
two cat and all the dog lover are because there two dog .,art
ive evened it up a bit .,art
and then ive got a grey wolf which came in only this week .,art
i saw it on facebook .,art
i belong to a group of free reference photograph .,art
they allow you to do it .,art
lot of people take the photograph .,art
and ive used quite a few of them .,art
that lion wa one of them .,art
but this grey wolf wa beautiful .,art
it wa beautiful .,art
i love wolf anyway .,art
and ive done a few of them now but i thought maybe another one .,art
i havent earmuffed him for sure yet but ive got him standing in the wing .,art
the dog that i am using is a man .,art
i think ive got the other dog .,art
i might be able to give you a brief .,art
there you go .,art
thats beautiful .,art
look at that .,art
i love that .,art
you can see how you can not resist some of these .,art
quite a lot of work in that background .,art
again similar to the cat we were talking about ive got to alter it and change it .,art
and thatll be interesting .,art
well talk about that next time .,art
how ive got in my mind .,art
thats one that i will do the background afterwards .,art
i am using the white pastime paper for that .,art
can not you use black or grey ?,art
the problem here is you never get the white white enough .,art
you will not get that contrast .,art
by using the light grey pastime i can emphasise the white but still put the dark colour in .,art
we are going to work out hopefully .,art
thats the next one .,art
thats on the chock .,art
ill check in with you and see how you are doing with that picture or a different one you decide next week .,art
maybe well get some more question that have come in a . if you do post something on facebook that youd for u to talk about then tag either one of u in it we can see it .,art
we pick it up and mention that youd u to discus it .,art
perhaps we can talk about it on the show .,art
you can always drop u an email or comment on this video with your question .,art
we can talk about them in the show .,art
otherwise well continue to talk about your artwork dad and the various piece that youve done .,art
well leave it there for this week .,art

i am excited about today topic .,education
it is something thats important for all of u whether we are parent teacher or student .,education
but before we get into that how are you doing julia ?,education
i am doing great too .,education
and yes i agree .,education
today topic is close to my heart and i think it is going to be a great conversation .,education
what are we talking about today adam ?,education
julia today episode is all about the role of parent in supporting childrens education .,education
we know that education is key to a child future but it is not about what happens in the classroom .,education
the support that child get from their parent at home can make a huge difference in how they do in school and in life .,education
parent play such a crucial role in their childrens education from helping with homework to encouraging them to do their best .,education
there are many way that parent can be involved and it doesnt matter if the parent are busy or if they do not have a lot of experience with the school system .,education
there are still simple thing they can do to support their child .,education
and in today episode we are going to break it down and talk about some of those simple but powerful way that parent can support their childrens learning .,education
well be covering everything from creating a positive learning environment at home to staying in touch with teacher and motivating child to do their best .,education
and to help u with this discussion we have a very special guest with u today .,education
he someone who ha a lot of experience in this area both a a parent and a someone who worked closely with school and teacher .,education
please welcome michael .,education
thank you much for joining u today .,education
thank you for having me .,education
i am excited to be here and to talk about this important topic .,education
we are happy to have you with u michael .,education
before we dive into the discussion why do not you tell our listener a little bit about yourself and your experience with supporting childrens education ?,education
i am a father of three and my kid are all in different stage of their education .,education
my oldest is in high school my middle child is in middle school and my youngest is starting elementary school .,education
ive been through a lot of different phase a a parent and ive learned a lot about what work and what doesnt when it come to supporting my kid in their education .,education
thats great michael .,education
it sound you have a wealth of experience to share with u . i am sure our listener will find your insight valuable .,education
yes definitely .,education
we are looking forward to hearing your perspective especially since youve had to support your child at many different stage of their education .,education
and i know that many of our listener are parent who are also trying to figure out the best way to help their child succeed in school .,education
and i think one of the most important thing for parent to remember is that they do not have to be expert to make a difference .,education
sometimes being there and showing that you care can have a huge impact on a child motivation and confidence .,education
thats such an important point michael .,education
i think a lot of parent worry that they do not know enough to help their child with their schoolwork especially if they are busy or if they did not have the same opportunity when they were growing up .,education
but you said being involved and showing interest can make a big difference .,education
yes and thats exactly what we want to focus on today .,education
practical way that any parent can support their child education no matter their background or circumstance .,education
well be talking about how to create a positive learning environment at home how to communicate effectively with teacher and how to encourage and motivate child to do their best .,education
and of course well be hearing from michael about his own experience and the lesson he learned along the way .,education
well also have a qa session later in the podcast where well answer some question from our listener about this topic .,education
if you are a parent a teacher or someone who interested in education this episode is for you .,education
well be keeping thing simple and easy to understand .,education
even if you are starting to learn english youll be able to follow along .,education
and do not forget if you have any question or comment during the podcast you can reach out to u on our social medium channel .,education
we love hearing from our listener and getting your feedback .,education
now let get started with our discussion on the role of parent in supporting childrens education .,education
weve got a lot to cover let dive in .,education
julia before we get into the main discussion i thought it would be nice for u to share a little bit about our own experience with education .,education
i think it is always interesting to hear how different people were supported by their parent when they were growing up .,education
what do you think ?,education
i think thats a great idea adam .,education
after all everyones educational journey is unique and it can shape who we become .,education
for me education wa always a big focus in my family .,education
my parent were very involved but in different way .,education
my mom wa always the one helping me with my homework .,education
she would sit with me at the kitchen table and wed go over my assignment together .,education
she wasnt a teacher but she always encouraged me to try my best and made sure i had everything i needed to succeed .,education
that sound wonderful julia .,education
it is amazing how much of a difference that support can make .,education
my experience wa a bit different .,education
my parent were both very busy with work they did not have a much time to help me with my schoolwork directly .,education
but they always made it clear that education wa important .,education
they set high expectation and they were always there to celebrate my success .,education
even though they couldnt always be there physically their support wa always felt .,education
they made sure i knew that doing in school wa my job and they were proud of me when i worked hard .,education
thats important adam .,education
i think a lot of parent feel they need to be sitting down with their child every night to help with homework but thats not always possible .,education
what matter is the message that parent send about education .,education
whether it is through helping with homework setting expectation or being there to encourage and motivate parent play a huge role in shaping their childrens attitude toward learning .,education
and i think thats something we can all relate to no matter where we come from .,education
parental involvement doesnt have to be about doing the work for your child .,education
it is about being a source of support and encouragement .,education
it is about creating an environment where learning is valued and where child feel confident to take on challenge and ask for help when they need it .,education
yes and that brings u to the bigger picture of why parental involvement is crucial .,education
study have shown that when parent are involved in their childrens education those child tend to do better in school .,education
they have higher grade better attendance and they are more likely to continue their education beyond high school .,education
it is not about helping with homework .,education
it is about being engaged in their overall learning process .,education
when parent show an interest in their childrens education it sends a powerful message that education is important and that can be incredibly motivating for child .,education
it help them see that what they are doing in school matter not to them but to their family a . and it is not about academic success either .,education
parental involvement can also help child develop better social skill and selfesteem .,education
when child know that their parent are there to support them they are more likely to take on new challenge and to keep trying even when thing get tough .,education
it give them the confidence to push through obstacle because they know they are not alone .,education
thats such an important point julia .,education
education is not about getting good grade .,education
it is about developing the skill and confidence to succeed in life and parent have a huge role to play in that .,education
by being involved they are helping to build a foundation for their childrens future success not in school but in everything they do .,education
exactly adam and thats why we wanted to talk about this topic today .,education
whether you are a parent a teacher or even a student it is important to understand the impact that parental involvement can have .,education
it is something that can make a real difference in a child life and it is something that we can all work to improve no matter our circumstance .,education
yes and thats what we are going to explore in more detail today .,education
well be talking about specific way that parent can get involved no matter how busy they are or what their background is .,education
we want to provide practical tip and advice that anyone can use to support their child education .,education
and with michael here to share his experience we are going to get some valuable insight that i think our listener will find helpful .,education
whether you are a parent looking for new way to support your child or someone interested in the topic stay tuned .,education
weve got a lot of great information coming your way .,education
we are getting started and we have much to cover .,education
let dive into our first key point how parent can create a positive learning environment at home .,education
now that weve set the stage it is time to dive into our main discussion .,education
in this section well be talking about three key way parent can support their childrens education creating a positive learning environment communicating with teacher and encouraging and motivating child .,education
let get started with our first key point creating a positive learning environment .,education
one of the most important thing parent can do to support their child education is to create a positive learning environment at home .,education
a child learning environment ha a huge impact on their ability to focus stay organized and feel motivated to do their best .,education
but what exactly doe a positive learning environment look ?,education
and how can parent create one ?,education
for starter it is important to have a designated study space for your child .,education
this doesnt mean you need to have a whole room dedicated to studying but there should be a specific area where your child know they can go to focus on their schoolwork .,education
this space should be quiet free from distraction and organized .,education
when a child ha a clean calm place to work it help them concentrate and signal to them that this is a place where learning happens .,education
thats a great point adam .,education
i know that when i wa a student having a specific spot where i could sit down and focus made all the difference .,education
but i also think it is important to make the learning environment not functional but also engaging .,education
after all learning shouldnt feel a chore .,education
parent can do simple thing to make learning at home more fun and interesting for their child .,education
for example you could incorporate your child interest into their study space .,education
if they love drawing have some art supply nearby that they can use during break .,education
if they are into science you could decorate the area with poster or book about their favorite scientific topic .,education
making the space inviting and relevant to your child interest can help make study time something they look forward to rather than something they dread .,education
thats such a good idea julia .,education
and it emphasizes the fact that a positive learning environment is about more than physical space .,education
it is also about creating an atmosphere that encourages curiosity and a love for learning .,education
michael youve been through this with your own kid .,education
how have you gone about setting up a good learning environment at home ?,education
adam and julia ive found that creating a positive learning environment is about finding what work best for each individual child .,education
with my three kid i quickly learned that what work for one doesnt necessarily work for the others .,education
my oldest for example need complete silence when shes studying .,education
we set up a quiet corner in her room with a desk a comfortable chair and a lamp with adjustable lighting .,education
we made sure it wa a place where she could shut the door and focus without interruption .,education
my middle child on the other hand like a bit of background noise when he study .,education
he often doe his homework at the dining room table where he can still hear whats going on around the house .,education
for him the key wa having a big open space where he could spread out his material .,education
we also keep a basket of school supply on the table he ha everything he need within reach .,education
and for my youngest who starting elementary school weve set up a little learning nook in the living room .,education
it is cozy with a small desk and some shelf where we keep book and educational game .,education
she love having a space that feel her own but where we can still keep an eye on her and step in to help when she need it .,education
thats insightful michael .,education
it sound youve put a lot of thought into creating space that suit each of your childrens need .,education
and i think thats such an important takeaway for our listener .,education
there no one size fit all solution when it come to creating a positive learning environment .,education
it is all about paying attention to what your child need to be able to focus and feel comfortable .,education
yes and i love how youve managed to make those space not only functional but also personalized to each of your child .,education
it go to show that even small change can have a big impact on how a child feel about studying .,education
when kid have a space that they enjoy it can make all the difference in their attitude toward their schoolwork .,education
and i think one of the most important thing is to involve your child in setting up their study space .,education
ask them what they need what make them feel comfortable and what they would to have in their space .,education
when kid have a say in creating their learning environment they are more likely to take ownership of their study time and stay motivated .,education
thats a great tip michael .,education
and it is a perfect segue into our next key point communication between parent and teacher .,education
setting up a good learning environment at home is important but it is one part of the puzzle .,education
staying informed about whats happening at school and working together with teacher is crucial for a child success .,education
exactly adam .,education
communication between parent and teacher is important and it is something that can make a difference in a child education .,education
when parent and teacher are on the same page it help to ensure that child are getting the support they need both at school and at home .,education
but i know that for some parent especially those who are new to the school system or who may not speak english a their first language reaching out to teacher can feel a bit intimidating .,education
one of the most important thing to remember is that teacher are there to help .,education
they want to see your child succeed a much a you do and they are usually very willing to communicate with parent .,education
it doesnt have to be a formal meeting every time .,education
you can start by sending a simple email or making a quick phone call to check in on your child progress .,education
and it doesnt take much to stay informed .,education
for example many school now have online portal where parent can log in and see their child grade assignment and any comment from teacher .,education
this can be a great way to keep track of how your child is doing without having to wait for report card or parentteacher conference .,education
but of course nothing beat direct communication .,education
setting up regular meeting with your child teacher even if it is once or twice a year can help you understand what your child is learning and where they might need extra support .,education
it also give you the opportunity to ask question and share any concern you might have .,education
and another important aspect of communication is sharing information with teacher about your child learning style interest or any challenge they might be facing .,education
teacher often have many student and while they do their best to get to know each child they can benefit from parent insight .,education
if your child is struggling with a particular subject or if there something going on at home that might be affecting their schoolwork letting the teacher know can help them provide the support .,education
i completely agree julia .,education
in my experience being open and communicative with teacher ha made a big difference for my kid .,education
for example my middle child wa having some trouble with math a few year ago .,education
i made sure to speak with his teacher about it and she wa able to recommend some extra resource and strategy that we could use at home .,education
we also set up a system where i would check in with her every few week to see how he wa progressing .,education
it wasnt a big time commitment but it made a world of difference for him .,education
and it is not about addressing problem .,education
regular communication can also help reinforce what your child is doing .,education
when teacher know that you are interested and involved they can share positive feedback with you that you can then pas on to your child .,education
it creates a positive cycle of encouragement that can boost a child confidence and motivation .,education
thats such a good point michael .,education
positive communication between parent and teacher doesnt help with addressing challenge .,education
it also help celebrate success .,education
and when child see that their parent and teacher are working together it sends a strong message that their education is important and valued .,education
yes and i think it is also important to remember that communication doesnt have to be all about academic .,education
teacher can offer insight into other aspect of your child development their social skill behavior and overall being .,education
by staying in touch with teacher parent can get a more complete picture of how their child is doing in school and can provide better support at home .,education
and for parent who might feel hesitant about reaching out to teacher i would say do not be afraid to start the conversation .,education
teacher appreciate when parent are involved and even a small effort to communicate can have a big impact on your child education .,education
it doesnt have to be perfect and it doesnt have to be formal .,education
what matter most is that you are showing an interest in your child learning .,education
i couldnt agree more michael .,education
communication is key and it is something that can help parent teacher and student work together a a team .,education
now let move on to our third key point encouraging and motivating child .,education
this is where parent can make a difference in their child academic success .,education
encouragement is such a powerful tool when it come to helping child succeed in school .,education
a parent you have the ability to shape how your child feel about learning and education .,education
when child feel supported and encouraged they are more likely to stay motivated even when the work get challenging .,education
one of the simplest way to encourage your child is by showing interest in their schoolwork .,education
ask them about what they are learning what they find interesting and what they might be struggling with .,education
even sitting down with them while they do their homework can show that you are invested in their education .,education
it is all about being present and showing that you care .,education
thats true adam .,education
and it is not about praising them when they get good grade or do something .,education
it is also about recognizing their effort even if the result are not perfect .,education
for example if your child is working hard on a difficult math problem but doesnt quite get the answer you can still praise them for trying and encourage them to keep at it .,education
it is important to let child know that making mistake is a part of learning and that their effort are valued .,education
exactly julia .,education
encouragement shouldnt be about the end result .,education
it should also be about the process .,education
when child know that their hard work is noticed and appreciated they are more likely to develop a growth mindset .,education
this mean theyll be more willing to take on challenge and learn from their mistake rather than feeling discouraged when thing do not go perfectly .,education
i can definitely relate to that adam .,education
in my experience one of the best way to motivate child is to focus on the effort they put in rather than the outcome .,education
for instance my youngest wa struggling with reading at the beginning of the school year .,education
she would get frustrated and start to avoid reading altogether .,education
but instead of focusing on whether she got the word we started celebrating every time she sat down to practice even if it wa for a few minute .,education
wed make a big deal out of the fact that she wa trying and gradually her confidence started to grow .,education
we also found way to make reading more enjoyable for her .,education
we let her choose book that interested her and sometimes wed read together a a family .,education
by making it a positive experience and showing her that we were proud of her effort she started to improve .,education
and most importantly she began to enjoy reading again .,education
thats such a great approach michael .,education
it highlight the importance of making learning a positive experience for child .,education
when they feel good about what they are doing they are much more likely to stay motivated .,education
and i love the idea of making learning a family activity .,education
it show child that education is valued and that it is something everyone in the family is involved in .,education
and i think thats key julia .,education
when parent are involved and show that they value education it sends a powerful message to their child .,education
it is not about telling them that school is important .,education
it is about showing them through your action whether it is setting aside time to help with homework attending school event or simply asking about their day .,education
these small action can have a big impact on how child perceive their education .,education
absolutely adam .,education
and ive also found that setting goal together can be a great way to keep child motivated .,education
whether it is finishing a book improving in a particular subject or even something simple completing their homework on time setting small achievable goal give child something to work toward .,education
and when they reach those goal it is important to celebrate their achievement no matter how small they might seem .,education
this reinforces the idea that their hard work pay off and encourages them to keep striving for success .,education
thats a wonderful idea michael .,education
setting goal can help child stay focused and motivated and celebrating their success big or small help build their confidence and encourages them to keep pushing themselves .,education
it is all about creating a positive cycle of effort and reward .,education
and i think another important aspect of motivation is helping child see the value in what they are learning .,education
sometimes especially with subject they find difficult child might feel what they are learning doesnt matter .,education
but a parent you can help connect their schoolwork to reallife situation or their own interest .,education
for example if your child love playing video game you could talk about how math is used in game design .,education
or if they are into sport you could discus how science play a role in understanding how the body work .,education
thats a great point adam when child can see the relevance of what they are learning it becomes more meaningful to them .,education
it help them understand that what they are doing in school ha realworld application and is not something they have to do because they are told to .,education
and when they see the value in their education they are more likely to stay engaged and motivated .,education
exactly michael .,education
and i think it is also important to remind child that it is to ask for help when they are struggling .,education
sometimes child might feel they have to do everything on their own but thats not the case .,education
whether it is asking a teacher for extra help working with a tutor or even talking thing through with a parent .,education
it is important for child to know that it is to seek support when they need it .,education
encouraging them to ask question and seek help can boost their confidence and help them overcome challenge more effectively .,education
thats such an important point julia .,education
asking for help is a strength not a weakness .,education
and a parent it is our job to let our child know that it is to reach out when they are facing difficulty .,education
whether it is academic or emotional support being there for our child and helping them navigate challenge is one of the most important thing we can do to support their education .,education
and at the end of the day i think the most important thing is to let our child know that we believe in them .,education
when child know that their parent are in their corner cheering them on and supporting them every step of the way it give them the confidence to keep going even when thing get tough .,education
thats a wonderful note to end on michael .,education
encouraging and motivating our child creating positive learning environment and maintaining open communication with teacher .,education
these are all essential way parent can support their child education .,education
by being involved showing interest and providing support parent can make a huge difference in their child academic success .,education
and i hope our listener have found today discussion helpful and inspiring .,education
remember supporting your child education doesnt have to be complicated .,education
it is about the little thing being present showing interest and encouraging them to do their best .,education

it is been a pleasure to talk about such an important topic .,education
thank you michael .,education
and to all our listener thank you for tuning in .,education

now let dive deeper into today topic by hearing from our special guest michael .,education
michael youve been involved in your childrens education for many year and i am sure you have some valuable insight to share with our listener .,education
could you start by telling u about a personal experience where your involvement in your child education made a real difference ?,education
thank you for having me on the podcast today .,education
i am passionate about this topic because ive seen firsthand how much of an impact parent can have on their childrens education .,education
id to share a story thats very close to my heart .,education
this story is about my eldest daughter emma .,education
when emma wa in the fourth grade she started struggling with math .,education
it wasnt that she wasnt capable she had a hard time grasping some of the concept .,education
at first she would come home frustrated saying that math wa too hard and that she did not understand what the teacher wa explaining .,education
a a parent it wa tough to see her upset and feeling she wa falling behind .,education
i realized that if i did not step in to help emma might start to lose confidence in herself and her ability .,education
i began by talking to her teacher to better understand what emma wa struggling with .,education
the teacher wa very helpful and suggested some resource that we could use at home .,education
after that we set up a dedicated study time for math each evening .,education
it wasnt always easy and there were time when emma would get frustrated or want to give up .,education
but i made sure to be patient and positive .,education
we worked on the problem together and i tried to make it a fun a possible by turning it into a game or using reallife example that she could relate to .,education
over time i started to see a change in emma .,education
she began to approach math with a little more confidence and the concept that once seemed impossible started to make sense to her .,education
by the end of the school year emma not only improved her math grade but also gained a new sense of selfbelief .,education
she realized that with hard work and the support she could overcome challenge and thats a lesson that ha stayed with her ever since .,education
looking back i am glad i took the time to get involved .,education
it wasnt about improving her math skill it wa about showing her that she wasnt alone and that she had someone in her corner cheering her on .,education
that experience strengthened our relationship and gave her the confidence to tackle other challenge in the year to come .,education
thats such an inspiring story michael .,education
it highlight the difference that parental involvement can make in a child education .,education
your patience encouragement and willingness to work alongside emma clearly made a huge impact on her confidence and academic success .,education
and whats important to note here is that it wasnt about helping with homework .,education
it wa about being present being supportive and creating a positive learning environment where emma felt safe to make mistake and learn from them .,education
michael i am sure there are many parent listening who want to be a supportive a you were with emma .,education
what practical advice would you give to parent who want to support their childrens education ?,education
i think the most important piece of advice i can give is to be present and engaged .,education
you do not have to be an expert in every subject or spend hour helping with homework but showing interest in your child education can make a world of difference .,education
here are a few practical tip that ive found to be effective .,education
one communicate regularly with teacher .,education
one of the best way to stay informed about your child progress is to maintain open line of communication with their teacher .,education
do not wait for parentteacher conference .,education
reach out periodically to ask how your child is doing what they are excelling in and where they might need extra help .,education
teacher can offer valuable insight and suggestion that you can use to support your child at home .,education
two create a positive learning environment at home .,education
a i mentioned earlier setting up a dedicated study space can help your child focus and feel more organized .,education
this doesnt have to be a big fancy room a quiet lit area with all the supply they need .,education
make sure it is a space where they feel comfortable and free from distraction .,education
additionally try to establish a routine for homework and study time .,education
having a consistent schedule can help child develop good study habit .,education
three be a role model .,education
child learn a lot by observing the adult around them .,education
if they see that you value education and lifelong learning they are more likely to adopt those same attitude .,education
this doesnt mean you have to go back to school yourself but showing curiosity reading book and talking about what you are learning can inspire your child to do the same .,education
four encourage a growth mindset .,education
it is important to teach your child that intelligence and ability can be developed through effort and perseverance .,education
praise them for their hard work not their grade and help them see mistake a opportunity to learn and grow .,education
when child understand that they can improve through effort they are more likely to embrace challenge and keep trying even when thing get tough .,education
five stay positive and patient .,education
there will be time when your child get frustrated or feel overwhelmed and it is important to stay positive and patient during these moment .,education
listen to their concern offer reassurance and help them break down task into smaller manageable step .,education
remind them that it is to struggle sometimes .,education
what matter is that they keep trying and do not give up .,education
six be involved but not overbearing .,education
while it is important to be involved in your child education it is equally important to give them space to learn and grow independently .,education
encourage them to take responsibility for their own learning and problemsolving but let them know that you are there to support them when needed .,education
finding the balance between being involved and giving them autonomy can help them develop confidence and selfdiscipline .,education
seven celebrate achievement big and small .,education
finally take the time to celebrate your child achievement no matter how small they may seem .,education
whether it is completing a challenging assignment improving in a subject or simply sticking to their study routine recognizing their effort can boost their confidence and motivation .,education
celebration do not have to be elaborate .,education
sometimes a simple word of praise or a special family activity is all it take to show that you are proud of them .,education
those are such valuable tip michael .,education
i especially love the idea of celebrating both the big and small achievement .,education
it is a great way to keep child motivated and to show them that their hard work is appreciated .,education
and i think your point about encouraging a growth mindset is particularly important michael .,education
it is crucial for child to understand that they can improve through effort and that mistake are part of the learning process .,education
this mindset not only help them in school but also in life .,education
exactly adam .,education
it is all about helping our child build the confidence to face challenge head on knowing that they have the support and resource to succeed .,education
and remember every child is different what work for one child might not work for another .,education
it is important to be flexible and willing to try different approach until you find what work best for your child .,education
thank you much for sharing your experience and advice with u michael .,education
i am sure our listener have found it incredibly helpful .,education
your story about emma is a wonderful example of how parental involvement can make a real difference in a child education .,education
it is been a pleasure julia .,education
i am glad i could share my experience and i hope it encourages other parent to get involved in their childrens education .,education
it is one of the most rewarding thing you can do a a parent .,education
absolutely michael .,education
and i think the key takeaway here is that being involved doesnt have to be complicated .,education
it is about showing up being supportive and creating an environment where your child feel valued and encouraged .,education
with that we are going to wrap up this segment .,education
but before we do julia do you have any final thought ?,education
that i hope our listener feel empowered to take an active role in their childrens education .,education
a weve discussed today even small action can make a big difference .,education
whether it is setting up a study space staying in touch with teacher or simply praising your child effort remember that your involvement is crucial to their success .,education
and once again thank you michael for joining u and sharing your valuable insight .,education
we appreciate your time and your commitment to supporting your childrens education .,education

remember supporting your child education is one of the most important thing you can do a a parent .,education
well be back next time with more tip and advice .,education
stay tuned .,education
until next time keep encouraging your child stay involved in their education and most importantly believe in their potential .,education
all michael weve covered a lot of ground today .,education
your insight have been incredibly valuable but i am sure our listener might still have a few question .,education
julia and i have a couple of question ourselves that we think will help parent who are navigating the challenge of supporting their childrens education .,education
michael one thing that come to mind is the balance between helping your child and giving them enough space to learn independently .,education
this is something many parent struggle with .,education
how did you manage this with your own child ?,education
did you ever find it difficult to step back and let them figure thing out on their own ?,education
and it is something i think all parent grapple with at some point .,education
when your child struggling the instinct is to step in and fix the problem for them .,education
but over time ive learned that it is important to give them the tool they need to solve problem independently while still being there a a support system .,education
for example with my son jake there were time when he would get frustrated with a difficult homework problem .,education
my first instinct wa to give him the answer or guide him step by step .,education
but i realized that this approach wasnt helping him develop critical thinking skill .,education
instead i started asking him guiding question to help him think through the problem on his own .,education
id say thing what do you think the first step should be ?,education
or have you seen a problem this before ?,education
how did you solve that one ?,education
this way i wa still involved but i wa encouraging him to take the lead .,education
it wasnt always easy to hold back .,education
but over time jake became more confident in his ability and more willing to tackle challenge on his own .,education
of course i wa always there to step in if he truly needed help .,education
but by giving him the space to try on his own first he learned to trust his instinct and develop his problem solving skill .,education
thats such an important point michael .,education
it is about finding that balance between being supportive and fostering independence .,education
and it sound your approach not only helped jake academically but also built his confidence in facing challenge .,education
now another challenge many parent face is managing their own expectation and pressure around their child education .,education
we live in a world where academic success is often seen a a key indicator of future success .,education
and this can create a lot of stress for both parent and child .,education
how did you handle these pressure ?,education
and what advice would you give to parent who are feeling overwhelmed by the desire for their child to succeed ?,education
you are absolutely adam .,education
the pressure to succeed academically can be intense and it is easy for parent to feel they have to push their child to excel in every subject .,education
but what ive learned over the year is that success is not about grade .,education
it is about helping your child develop a love for learning and the resilience to overcome challenge .,education
with my daughter emma for example i had to remind myself that it wa if she did not get straight a in every subject .,education
what mattered more wa that she wa trying her best and that she wa happy and healthy .,education
i made a conscious effort to focus on her overall development not her academic performance .,education
i encouraged her to explore her interest whether that wa reading art or sport and i tried to celebrate her effort rather than the outcome .,education
my advice to other parent would be to take a step back and look at the bigger picture .,education
ask yourself what person do i want my child to become ?,education
focus on nurturing quality curiosity kindness and perseverance rather than academic achievement .,education
and remember it is to adjust your expectation based on your child individual strength and interest .,education
every child is unique and success can look different for each one .,education
thats such a refreshing perspective michael .,education
it is easy to get caught up in the pressure to perform but it is important to remember that education is about more than grade .,education
it is about helping child grow into rounded individual .,education
now let talk about the challenge that come with balancing work life and being actively involved in your child education .,education
many parent especially working parent struggle to find the time to be a involved a they would to be .,education
but what ive found is that it is not necessarily about the quantity of time you spend but the quality .,education
one thing that worked for me wa setting aside specific time each day or week that were dedicated to my child .,education
it did not have to be long .,education
sometimes it wa fifteentwenty minute but during that time i would focus entirely on them .,education
whether it wa helping with homework reading together or talking about their day those moment became meaningful .,education
another tip is to involve your child in your daily routine .,education
for example if you are cooking dinner ask them to help and use that time to talk about what they are learning in school .,education
if you are running errand bring them along and have a conversation about something educational math when you are shopping or geography when you are driving .,education
finally do not be afraid to ask for help .,education
if you have a partner family member or even a friend who can pitch in that can make a big difference .,education
and remember it is to prioritize your own being too .,education
if you are stressed and overwhelmed it is harder to be present for your child .,education
make sure you are taking care of yourself a . those are such practical and reassuring tip michael .,education
it is all about finding way to be involved that fit into your life rather than feeling you have to do everything perfectly .,education
and i think what you said about quality time is important .,education
it is those focused intentional moment that make a difference .,education
absolutely adam .,education
and i love the idea of involving child in everyday activity a a way to stay connected and support their learning .,education
it is a great reminder that education doesnt happen in the classroom .,education
it is a part of life .,education
now let take a moment to see if we have any question from our listener .,education
weve received a few interesting one in advance .,education
here one from sarah a mother of two who asks michael how do you handle situation where your child is resistant to your involvement or help with schoolwork ?,education
my son often say he doesnt need my help and get frustrated when i try to get involved .,education
how can i support him without making him feel pressured ?,education
thats a thoughtful question sarah .,education
and i completely understand where you are coming from .,education
it is not uncommon for child especially a they get older to want more independence and resist parental involvement .,education
in situation this it is important to respect their need for autonomy while also finding way to offer support .,education
one approach ive found helpful is to take a step back and give your child some control over how and when you get involved .,education
for example you might say i am here if you need any help but i trust that you can handle this on your own .,education
let me know if there anything specific youd to talk through or if you need a second pair of eye on something .,education
this way you are letting them know that you are available without being overbearing .,education
another strategy is to focus on openended conversation rather than direct assistance .,education
instead of saying do you need help with your homework ?,education
you might ask how do you feel about the assignment you are working on ?,education
or whats the most interesting thing you learned today ?,education
this can lead to a more relaxed conversation where your child feel comfortable sharing without feeling they are being pressured to accept help .,education
lastly try to reinforce the idea that making mistake and asking for help are normal part of the learning process .,education
sometimes child resist help because they are worried about disappointing their parent or because they want to prove they can do it on their own .,education
by creating an environment where it is to ask question and make mistake you can help alleviate some of that pressure .,education
thats such great advice michael .,education
it is all about finding that balance between being supportive and respecting your child growing independence and i think sarah will appreciate your thoughtful response .,education
yes thank you for that michael and thank you to our listener for sending in your question .,education
we always love hearing from you and it is valuable to have these reallife question to discus .,education
and once again a big thank you to michael for sharing his wisdom and experience with u today .,education
we hope that this qa session ha provided our listener with some practical strategy and reassurance a they navigate the challenge of supporting their childrens education .,education
it is been a pleasure being here and i hope that my experience can help other parent who are on this journey .,education
remember every parent and child is different find what work best for you and your family .,education
and do not forget to celebrate the small victory along the way .,education
wise word michael .,education
and with that we are going to wrap up today episode .,education
we hope you found this discussion helpful and that you are leaving with some new idea to try out at home .,education
remember supporting your child education is one of the most important thing you can do and even small effort can make a big difference .,education
every step you take a a parent to support your child learning is a step toward helping them grow into confident capable individual .,education
it doesnt have to be perfect consistent and heartfelt .,education

julia weve had a truly enlightening conversation today about the critical role parent play in supporting their childrens education .,education
let take a moment to recap some of the key point weve discussed .,education
absolutely adam .,education
we began by talking about the importance of creating a positive learning environment at home .,education

welcome to the upclosed podcast .,education

on today episode we are going to explore one of the most critical issue facing this country and that is a teacher shortage and educator shortage .,education
now more than at any time in recent memory we know that educator are leaving the profession and alarming rate .,education
a national survey that wa conducted by the national education association earlier this year revealed that a whopping fifty five of educator are considering leaving the profession earlier than planned .,education
and yet we know that a quality public education start with quality educator .,education
we need quality educator and education support professional in our public education system .,education
i am honored to welcome and to introduce to some and to introduce to others president becky pringle president of the nea the national education association welcome becky .,education
it is good to be with you sarah .,education
becky ha the awesome task of leading more than three million educator and education support professional who are member of the nea in this country .,education
she is a former middle school teacher .,education
we are honored .,education
i will tell you that during her time with the nea among her other accomplishment president pringle ha cochair the neas task force on school discipline and a school to present pipeline .,education
but let me tell you something .,education
if i were to enumerate all of president pringles accomplishment we would be here all day .,education
at this point i am going to welcome becky again and once again say how excited we are to have this important conversation with you a we look to the future of public education .,education
earlier this year the nea published a report on the educator shortage that is gripping the nation public school and through that report you outlined a long list of researchbased solution effective at recruiting and retaining educator and most importantly reflecting the need and priority of educator themselves .,education
from where you sit can you tell u why you think educator are at this time rethinking their place in the teaching profession and the education profession and whether or not they can remain a educator .,education
sarah again it is good to be with you .,education
i want to emphasize the part of my bio that talk about experience and education .,education
i taught middle school science .,education
yes there a special place in heaven for me and other middle school teacher .,education
i taught middle school middle level learner the joy of science for over thirty year .,education
when i talk about the educated crisis i talk about it from a place of experience knowledge a an educator .,education
now a president of the nea not only do i have that experience a a leader in the association i am bringing to bear the full force weight power strength of the largest labor union in the country but i do it from that lens of being a teacher .,education
this is not a new crisis .,education
this is chronic .,education
it ha existed when i wa in a classroom and it exists now .,education
it is with everything else the pandemic made it worse because thats what the pandemic did .,education
and the pandemic .,education
honestly helped u shine a light on something that weve been talking about and trying to sound the alarm around for many many year .,education
and the report that we that the nea issue and it is one of the thing that i insist on because of the conversation that i had with educator all over this country when i did what i called my georgia since an excellent store .,education
and i asked educator teacher and support that .,education
notice counselor aspiring educator and we can educate this question .,education
ask question and help u . i am sharing with what their hope and dream were what the concern were helped me understand why we saw in our survey fifty five of our educator talking about leaving the pressure to help me understand that .,education
and not the why but what would what could change that would would change their mind about about leaving .,education
and the report is full of research based solution a you said and i want to emphasize it it is the voice and experience of our educator when we talk about those solution .,education
and sarah i am sure i know youve heard this work because educator everywhere are using this work they tell me that it is about respect and i get that .,education
i absolutely get that .,education
a a teacher we never had the level of respect and support that we should have had should have a the professional we are .,education
when i asked him to peel that away dig into that what doe that look ?,education
what doe respect look to you ?,education
they were very clear about what that looked to them .,education
and they started with being treated a the professional they are .,education
and for them that meant that they had the authority and the collective autonomy to make teaching and learning decision for their student .,education
but it meant for them is that they had a that they earned a professional salary that reflected the important role they played in our society .,education
what it meant for them is that they got to make professional decision about how they spent their time in a way that they could attend to the individual need of student could welcome and who parent a partner could collaborate with their with their colleague .,education
for them it meant u treating the teaching profession a a continuum of practice professional practice .,education
at the front end a they were preparing a aspiring educator to become teacher and to continue to focus on improving their professional practice .,education
and then having those opportunity to lead in their profession they talked about all of those thing .,education
and they talked about the reality that they can not do it by themselves and share responsibility .,education
we say every student that we mean every student will succeed .,education
we need all of the social system surrounding our child with them or they mean they are ready to ready to come to school prepared to learn every day .,education
thank you much becky for sharing all of that .,education
and there many thing that youve said that id to follow up on .,education
youve spoken about how educator want choice and autonomy a they lead in their classroom and the opportunity to innovate .,education
and i think that for those whove not been in a classroom they might imagine of course thats what educator do thats what educator have the opportunity to do .,education
but you talk about it a something that educator are hoping for more of what are the barrier now to exercise to exercising that autonomy ?,education
they are trained .,education
they go to school a you very know .,education
they have to graduate and be licensed and they have to have content skill knowledge skill and ability a a pedagogical skill all of those thing and it is continuous training .,education
all of that go in to making those key decision that we can meet student where they are and help them along their learning journey .,education
it doesnt suggest that we a educator do not know and embrace the responsibility for continuous learning with our colleague and with others .,education
thats why you use that phrase intentionally collective authority that we are making decision that are best for our student in collaboration with others other educator with our parent with the student themselves much need to be attended to around student agent in their own learning .,education
all of those thing go in for educator go into that concept of a professional authority and collective autonomy .,education
what do you think can be done a presentpringle to increase those opportunity for educator and to open the door and to let them know that they have the respect they deserve they have the support they deserve .,education
first of all they are in position with it making decision .,education
ive used this word a lot myself and we use it a lot .,education
we talk about we talk about educator voice and absolutely their voice is paramount to getting it for student but it can not be voice .,education
it can not be my goodness we are going to invite you to share what you think but we are going to make decision .,education
we are the designer and well be making the decision and there have to be in that scene of decision making and then say say before not an isolation but they have to be able to make those decision .,education
thats what it look for them .,education
they have to know that they have the resource that they need to meet the need growing need .,education
we could talk about that on a whole other segment .,education
it is always been true that student bring the all the ill and challenge of society to our school outsourced .,education
thats always been true but it certainly ha grown over the year and after the pandemic even more the trauma the social and emotional need all of that and in the school need that .,education
and we have to have the resource to do the job we love .,education
we have to address the fact that weve disinvested in public education for decade we can not make up with a onetime infusion of money .,education
weve got to make that up in a way that we imagine our system and a way that we fund it in an equitable way that all of our student all of them get what they need .,education
where educator have not been central in the formation of those idea and those practice and forth .,education
i think if there i do not know that there necessarily a question when i have said but it is further common on what you have said .,education
it is important that educator voice and educator leadership is shaping instructional practice and more in school .,education
i do not know before i am going to take a little bit of a left term .,education
i do not know if you want to jump in further .,education
i love the way you phrase that to u . i want to lift it up that educator are central .,education
central in the formation of idea and i would add because sometimes that happens and then it take on this other reality because then educator are not then central to the implementation and central into ensuring that the resource are there .,education
theyve got to be central in each of those piece because weve got lot of idea .,education
i do not know if you and i say or well talk about our one of our love that we share and that is community school but thats an example i can give you many because i said ive been around a minute .,education
i see good idea that educator promoted get implemented in a way that thats loosely are not founded or executed in a way that the educator would imagine or certainly would do themselves .,education
it is got to be central to the formation of the idea central to the implementation central to the assessment ?,education
and the learning where educator want to continuously learn and what we call it wa i could come up with a better term than this but what we call scoping and scaling and you and i are doing them .,education
i am not sure i want to use that phrase but what .,education
yes spreading the learning and in a way that we have identified those core or and key principle but not that we are lifting it from this place and clapping it in another place and saying do this and youll be fine .,education
no that fly in the face of that what theyve been collaborative autonomy that that school that community is a part of it ?,education
and they own it and it is about them and it reflects their highest idea .,education
i wanted to i love that you said it that way and i wanted to expand on that .,education
can you talk a little bit about what you learn through your report preparation of that report and what the neas position is now on this issue of the particular increasing teacher of color in this country .,education
you are that it is a long time issue .,education
there no question about that and i want to talk about it from this perspective and in your first question you asked about the attracting and retaining and especially in this conversation we have to pay attention to the to the retention piece of thing .,education
this is a question that the number of college student of color who are making the choice to go into education ha declined .,education
we know that is true .,education
and i am struggling with saying it out wherever they leave at such a higher rate .,education
yeah that it is the retention problem is almost more critical .,education
and i want to call attention to that and i am going to lift up the work of dr. ivory tolson who is an extraordinary work in higher education and ha supported our work around hbcus and msis .,education
and he wa the first one to grab my face and said becky we appreciate that you are lifting that up that we need more student of color to go in .,education
but you need to be aware of the retention issue because not aware of that .,education
not only are you not going to solve the retention issue you in looking at the retention issue it help you on the attracting piece of thing .,education
and we see dig down into that in his research which i encourage you to listen to to dig into it .,education
but doe expose some of those thing that we have to address on both side .,education
one of the thing with teacher of college student of color choosing teaching and then after they get into teaching if they choose it staying in teaching .,education
and i believe that in this country we have never and it is gotten worse .,education
addressing issue of the cost of higher education .,education
we we have student of color who are graduating passive amount of debt .,education
why you not uniquely impacting them in a debt at a rate .,education
thats because of student of color ten to come from the family that do not have generation or thats an overstayment .,education
and they do not they do not have parent that maybe can step in and take over those loan .,education
they are starting their career where they have mountain of debt .,education
they are putting off having family they are making choice about where they live or what they can do .,education
and they then say i can not do it .,education
and they leave .,education
and student in college are making that decision too .,education
and looking at teaching and saying wait a minute i am accumulate knowledge that and i can not i can not i can not choose teaching .,education
it is a rare cause i know i am not going to i am never going to earn the pay thats commensurate with the work that i do .,education
and i am directly that address it at the same thing .,education
the other thing that i do the other thing i want to highlight we talk about diversifying the profession .,education
yes oftentimes and we point to the impact we have research on this .,education
the impact that a teacher of color can have on a student of color especially multiple teacher of color having them in a room .,education
but we also have evidence sarah that that having a diverse workforce impact why student too .,education
got to tell both both side of the story .,education
and then the last thing ill also i think go on and on about it .,education
but the last thing i want to lift up is and this come directly from our student our spy rage occupators a a our early career educator of color .,education
and that is that they get into the profession or they are aspiring to it .,education
and they do not have that support system .,education
that now work in the unique circumstance they find them .,education
and those are the kind of thing that we heard from them .,education
and those are the kind of program that any a is putting in place .,education
we know also becky this another dimension of that which is grievous and which our listener may not be aware of folk now talk about is the lifeo issue the fact last and first out .,education
and of course thats counterproductive to our desire to see a growth in teacher of color across the country .,education
what is the position of the nea on that ?,education
and what what do you think can be done that this doesnt become a two step forward one step back phenomenon ?,education
and the reason i bring that up in this context is because it is all lifeo .,education
it is always brought up in a way that the union are the reason why because of contract thats why we have to let the last thing go first .,education
when we know that for u we are about collaborating with others to absolutely best the job we possibly can for our student and for our educator go always tying back to the fact that we need more educator and we need to support them .,education
first of all the way we approached it they are in another place is why why why why why we are doing that we need more teacher .,education
let why why is anybody leaving ?,education
why is that happening ?,education
that shouldnt be happening .,education
what are we doing to resource that to that district ?,education
then they are not letting go of any educator .,education
the west side bayer and come together and collaborate together to get the resource that we have we can lower those class eye .,education
nobody leaving .,education
we are bringing more in .,education
there that .,education
additionally we know when we use it when we talk about it from that contentious place we talk about it a though other educator are expendable that thats not true .,education
we need our middle we need our midcareer teacher our world ha a midcareer educator a mentor .,education
thats why it is important to build the processing system and structure to support collaboration throughout the system that we have all of the educator .,education
the new new mid and veteran educator there a color in every category .,education
educator are bringing a wealth of experience to you geographically in other diversity in other way and not track this issue up a a false choice in which it should not be .,education
but we have the collaborate together and it should never be used a a way to suggest that we are not working to diversify our profession .,education
we are using strategy to address the issue of teacher pay .,education
we know that public education is the foundation of this democracy and for those people who have made that choice to educate america student weve got to collectively own that responsibility to elevate the profession .,education
i wanted to say that .,education
for u at the n e a it is about using a variety of strategy .,education
it is a union of course we are going to use our strategy of collective bargaining where we can and we have work with our local to use that to not only be strongly for increase in pay but to do a couple of thing .,education
using collective bargaining to pay for higher salary is a strategy of course that weve used before .,education
not all of our state have the ability to use collective bargaining weve been using strategy the one we use in louisiana where our affiliate there use the legislature to teach your salary and pay salary and we benefit .,education
and we use a variety of strategy to advocate for and demand higher salary .,education
we can not teach your pay if our school are not being adequately resource .,education
we have to address that at every level have to address it at the local level .,education
fighting to raise revenue at the local level changing how public school are funded and having them tied to the housing .,education
we know automatically set up a system of inequity .,education
we have to address it at the local level .,education
we have to address it at the state level .,education
the majority of funding for our school come at the state level .,education
we have to absolutely fight that at the state legislature fight for that at the state legislature and then of course the federal government role .,education
one of the thing that people do not always tie to what i said is the federal government promise to fund the fund idea which is the individual with disability education act the provides resource for our student with special need at a rate of forty .,education
and they never did that .,education
and that mean that the local and state have to pick that up .,education
and the federal government ha a role to play not in general education funding but specifically in special education funding .,education
funding is a key piece of the work we have to do to raise salary for educator .,education
and then lastly i want to mention this weve talked about which which we call a wage penalty gap which is existed again forever .,education
but after the pandemic we saw it rise throughout the pandemic .,education
it went from around twenty to now it is a little over twenty five .,education
that mean that similarly situated profession in term of experience and education teacher earn twenty five le .,education
thats not .,education
that is a societal issue that we have to address from the highest level of our government .,education
it is a societal issue .,education
indeed and there are many thing you said id to pick up on .,education
you said quickly but id to go back to something that the nea foundation is also fierce about .,education
and that is that the preservation and furtherance of public education is in the public interest .,education
public education is a public good .,education
i believe that a the nea doe such powerful work in collective bargaining and forth is building public will for public education .,education
and i am interested in your thought about that of course this is this also is not new .,education
it doe seem that a midsomony other pressing issue the country is facing .,education
there is this question of public education a a public good .,education
can you talk about absolutely and i would add a public good and thats the foundation of this democracy ?,education
yes we know .,education
yeah and thats why thats our founding more principle that that every every one of our student ha access to a quality high quality public education .,education
and we know that an educated citizen of student who are prepared to think critically and make and solve problem collaboratively we know our absolutely essential to our country living into it promise .,education
yeah we the people we the people we the people all of u have that to pursue happiness to be truly free .,education
for that to be a reality for everyone weve got to ensure that all of our student have that high quality public education .,education
and it can not be based on the zip code .,education
it can not be based on the family generational or current economic status .,education
it can it can not be based on race .,education
it ha to be based on their birthright a an american or for those whove come to our country a immigrant making sure that they have those opportunity .,education
they are not kept from those opportunity because they do not have fund to do it .,education
our country wa founded on that .,education
because if we do that if we create a system that work for our most marginalized student it will increase the opportunity for all of our student .,education
and that is how our country will live into it promise .,education
i believe that very much myself a doe the whole of the nea foundation .,education
i am trying to say in the most hopeful of perspective what are we looking for ?,education
we are we are looking for racial social and education justice for student for educator for community .,education
thats at the core for me it is at the core of everything .,education
and when people say to me becky thats a big old aspirational vision you all student all school all educator are excelled again everyone know it .,education
and for u to do that to first a a country to truly embrace that first of all to union honestly to the work toward that you you you always hear a common theme whenever i talk and you heard it today .,education
and that that is a core that core value of partnership .,education
we can not we can not do it alone .,education
within even within our own our own association sarah ive been talking about the concept of dynamic alignment that i love to say with a large slavery union in this country .,education
we have fifty one state affiliate .,education
we have fourteenzero local .,education
we have three million member .,education
unless and until we are lined in a way thats dynamic it is it is a constantly learning and with within among each other we are reaching across and helping each other and way that that that magnify that strength and power .,education
in way that we can win for our student all the time every day .,education
until unless that happens we are not going to reach that that full potential .,education
you always hear that .,education
and everything i say when you when you talk about a wish list it is that we continue that work together in a dynamic and aligned way toward racial social economic justice in this country .,education
and and that is and everything we do and i will tell you sarah every decision i make is steeped in that .,education
everything we do reflects that collaborative and collective responsibility for every one of our student .,education
what a wonderful vision and certainly one that that we share in a . and it is a good place to to start to turn toward home in the in this time together .,education
they want to be involved in solution making and they are not all educator .,education
they come from all walk .,education
i always to ask those who are on our podcast if you could speak to the listener that there something that everyone can do a pertains to this issue of a teacher shortage .,education
what how can the average person who not in the classroom or or if someone is what what would you hope we would be doing to support this important vision of education justice and education in social justice generally ?,education
because again we believe there is a role that everyone can play .,education
i would ask everyone whether you are in education or you are not in education to understand and own the responsibility regardless .,education
id to recommend that you could take that individual journey learn and read and i would i would appoint folk to pay a side at justice because it ha lot of resource you can do that .,education
and then reach out to others and have critical conversation that you can continue that learning and building up your your muscle and and that thing .,education
build partnership thats one of the thing that any a ha been focused on at the federal level .,education
yeah i mentioned the department of education ill mention the department of labor .,education
one of the thing that we are proud about is our partnership with them in establishing the the registered apprenticeship for teacher .,education
thats something completely a hundred million dollar of partner laborer put in to partner with u to have registered apprenticeship that educator inspiring educator whether they are in education or not can earn while they learn and be mentored by teacher .,education
thats part of the attracting and retaining piece of thing .,education
think about what partnership you can engage in in your community whether it is with with civil right organization or with parent or organization create space for student voice invite student into the conversation and give them that space and support them in their fight .,education
i am proud of them and the fight that they waged to around gun violence huge huge wa they did with u . create that space for for for student and then ill go back to something i said earlier asura we have to a participant in this democracy .,education
we have to pay attention to the people we put in position of power .,education
that necessarily mean asking question and holding people accountable .,education
yeah not holding a accountable .,education
i to say being that wind beneath their wing they can they can govern in a bold and righteous and focused and compelling and wait .,education
those are the kind of thing people can do now today .,education
but is awesome and response back .,education
yeah my goodness .,education
thank you much for that .,education
present pringle i always to close these podcasts by asking those we are interviewing .,education
if there is anything that they might to add .,education
id to see is there anything that i have not asked you or that you would want to add to this important conversation a president of the nea ?,education
say i shared earlier that i wa in the class for over thirty year .,education
and i have to tell you that in these last two and a half year a we all struggle through a pandemic and try to keep our student and educate a a community safe and continue to learn and deal with the trauma of being in a global pandemic .,education
i have never never been more proud to call myself a teacher .,education
be an educator .,education
a i am in this moment a i had the opportunity to not only honestly hold in my arm teacher from all of this country a a cry .,education
and i gave space for them to share their fear and challenge but to see the light in their eye .,education
and i would ask for everyone to celebrate our educator and what they have done in this moment what theyve always done honestly but it is one of the highest need how they stepped up in way who could never imagine .,education
take that time please to celebrate them to lift them up to say thank you .,education
and to let them know we got you .,education

yes there is a comment about you .,education
yes thank you very much .,education
it is a very good job .,education
and all .,education
thank you .,education
what wa your training point or point in your own education ?,education
ive had a long career .,education
i studied education .,education
but did not start teaching until later on in my life .,education
because i moved into the corporate world where i did adult learning and worked for a very large company in london out of new york .,education
and i worked in the personnel department human resource management human resource development .,education
got to see learning and education from the corporate world .,education
and i think that wa the debate my theory that i learned in education wa a good basis for me to start .,education
but i had to do a lot of learning in order to do my job .,education
and that job took me all over the world .,education
i wa able to work in new york san francisco hong kong buenos aire virginia switzerland and london of course .,education
and that wa great .,education
by the time i wa twenty eight i had traveled a lot .,education
for year a lot about adult education .,education
that wa one of the milestone in my education .,education
but that wa pretty early in my career .,education
and then i decided to take a job in germany for two year a a consultant .,education
and wound up staying here and ive been in germany now since one thousand nine hundred and ninety .,education
wow wonderful great .,education
it is wonderful i am sure. . let move to another question .,education
and would you that anything else ?,education
in the time that ive been here ive held a lot of different job .,education
pretty much helped many job already in the academic world .,education
and i did my phd here in germany and of course that led to me coming into the world of academia which i had never planned .,education
that wa not a plan .,education
it wa something that happened that way .,education
and soon after i opened up my first business here in germany .,education
and that led to me opening up five different school .,education
i wa also the owner of school throughout europe .,education
i had two school in germany .,education
i had a school in the netherlands a school in spain and also a school in greece .,education
up for our school in greece and spain we were doing medical english which wa not medical english medical german .,education
we were working in the european community project .,education
and my school in germany were geared more towards teacher education .,education
and i did that for about eighteen year .,education
and it wa before corona that we decided that we would slowly cut those school down because what we felt that the market wa moving more towards online learning .,education
and that wa a very great decision because that decision wa made before corona .,education
you are lucky then .,education
do we do the field that we needed office space anymore ?,education
because everything we were doing wa online anyway .,education
and i wa doing a lot of online learning a . it wa a great decision .,education
i am glad we made that decision because then corona came and we realized that if we would have stayed open we probably would have gone bankrupt .,education
yeah i am sure you answered and you would have lost of time the school time about it because many had i think .,education
yeah many school closed because of but for u the decision wa the strategic decision .,education
it wa a great decision .,education
god you were the group .,education
we made a great decision .,education
thank you very much .,education
thank you ron .,education
and you have a huge experience about teaching and learning learning of course .,education
and i am sure that during this experience and year you have tried lot of methodology and try strategy and also use them in your lesson or try to transfer these to the other teacher during your training .,education
and probably you have a a philosophy .,education
what is it ?,education
what is your philosophy of teaching ?,education
i think when you go to school and study education you learn a lot of theory .,education
but a a young teacher you got to get in there and start doing it because you are not going to have a highly developed teaching philosophy .,education
it take a while to develop that because youve got to have some experience classroom experience .,education
and youve got to be around other teacher a because being around other teacher help you to learn what they are doing .,education
you exchange information but coming from the corporate world learning work in a different way for adult .,education
and pretty much constructive approach to learning is very important for adult .,education
adult have to have handson experience .,education
they need to have task and adult understand what task are because thats what they have every day at work .,education
and they know that they have to be responsible to fulfilling those task .,education
the level of responsibility is already built in to how adult learn in the corporate world .,education
and that developed my teaching philosophy a i moved into the academic world .,education
and i have always been a constructiveist take constructiveist approach and for teacher teaching in academic situation at school whether that be primary school secondary school university a good example of constructiveist approach would be taskbased learning yes projectbased learning phenomenonbased learning all the pbls .,education
i wrote an article about get your pbls which i keep posting on my linkedin site a a my facebook site because i have a lot of follower on social medium .,education
and it is important to know your methodology but if you want to take constructiveist approach to learning and teaching you should know the minimum of taskbased learning and know the difference between a task and an activity because they are not the same .,education
and know all of your pbls and you are going in the direction of being constructiveist in your classroom .,education
thats influence my teaching philosophy because i do believe le i said in the beginning that lawyer need to be the creator of content .,education
and through constructiveist approach that will definitely happen .,education
thank you very much .,education
thank you very much for the information that to give about your philosophy of teaching .,education
if i am not wrong you are providing a consultancy to the school or the teacher when they need it .,education
you give them a support if i am not wrong .,education
why do that on social medium every day ?,education
yeah you do that .,education
and how do you for example when they ask you teacher or school when they ask your support and how do they help them and what do they need most ?,education
and in every time when you help them and are you successful about it or sometimes do you fail about it ?,education
can you tell u about it ?,education
there are a lot of thing that teacher need to know to be effective in the classroom .,education
and technology is one of them .,education
the integration of technology into teaching and learning is extremely important .,education
we can go back to the experience that teacher had worldwide when it come to when the pandemic started .,education
we could see that many teacher were not prepared for the pandemic because they had no experience with online learning and with technology .,education
and another discovery that teacher that wa one of those rude awakening and that teaching online is not the same thing a teaching in the classroom .,education
this requires a different pedagogical approach .,education
technology is one thing that teacher need to have and knowing the difference between facetoface learning and online learning and the different pedagogical approach that they need which lead to again them understanding framework .,education
tpack is a framework that i think many teacher need to be familiarized with and knowing that thats one of the thing that i think is very important .,education
if you do not know what tpack is you can google that .,education
i do not think we have a time to get into the detail of that .,education
they got to learn all of those thing .,education
and yes i do help private language school i have before but they are not my main client .,education
it is mostly university .,education
i work with a lot of professor phd student who are doing their phd they have to learn how to research they have to speak english they have to learn a lot of different skill .,education
and the professor that i work with thats why i have my job at the university that i work at is i am involved in an emi program which is english a a medium of instruction .,education
i work with specialist expert who are physicist scientist and i do not math the mathematician and very complicated science taught me .,education
now at the university i work at we have a language department .,education
i do not work in the language department and i do not work with any professor who ha not reached very high b1 level entry b2 level .,education
theyve got to get the basic of language behind them that we can work together in a onetoone coaching session to help them to improve their english because they want to deliver their class in english and help them with methodology a too .,education
thats the answer .,education
thank you .,education
thank you adam i understand that this is a support that youve given the teacher or the school .,education
i do work shop at for teacher organization and travel around the world doing that .,education
it is very hard to take something i try to be very general in nature when i am working with teacher and teacher organization because of the different context that they work in .,education
it take a while for them to accept that teaching and learning .,education
i understand it is sometimes hard for them to adopt it .,education
and far because we are here an a hard for the student .,education
the board exactly thank you very much .,education
thank you very much ron .,education
i would to ask i am sure that you have a i mentioned before that you have a huge experience and also you have lot of story .,education
i am sure that you have a success story too .,education
is it possible to tell u one or two success story of yours something inspirational what would to share ?,education
i think i am sixty five year old and i have to say ive been very blessed in my career but i work very hard .,education
and i am one of those people who threw themselves into work because i what i do .,education
and ive learned a lot in my journey a being a teacher .,education
weve had i think all of u could tell story of success but we probably have more story of failure than we do with success because thats the reality of teaching .,education
i think .,education
we learning by doing but yes there are a lot of thing that i can say i am very proud of .,education
i am very proud of the fact that i am a risk attacker and leaving the united state leaving my friend leaving my family leaving my culture and moving to another country permanently wa a big move in my life .,education
but i did it when i wa young and i stood a lot of energy .,education
and glad i did that when i wa a younger because it wa a great move a very very great move .,education
and i am very proud of that that i had enough nerve to do it .,education
and i think the other thing that i could say that i am also very proud of in my career is the fact that i took the risk of opening up a business and not knowing what wa going to come .,education
i had a lot of idea of how i would want to do thing .,education
and every day wa a learning experience for me .,education
and the first two year were very difficult but i had a fulltime job .,education
i did not always get my wholetime job .,education
and once the school became successful when we started to grow and started to learn a lot about business and i studied business .,education
i have an mba in international business administration .,education
and all of those thing i learned were theory but when you have your own business you start to see the thing from firsthand .,education
i learned a lot there .,education
i am glad i survived that .,education
and i could probably write a book about that .,education
owning a business in education is fun .,education
but i wa glad when i closed my school .,education
and i am glad now for the where i am at now in my life .,education
my life is a little bit easier not stressful .,education
and i can enjoy all the thing that ive worked for in my life my garden .,education
thank you .,education
thank you very much aron .,education
and i would to ask you that another question something related with the education and a we all know that the artificial intelligence is getting bigger and bigger and take the huge part in our the daily life especially the social medium .,education
and also i think it is it is moving to every part of every part of the the the job .,education
and also it is also in the education .,education
and what do you think ?,education
what do you think about ai and the language education ?,education
whats going to happen with it ?,education
those are several question .,education
but let me start by saying that everybody seems to have their all in an uproar about ai but ai is not new .,education
it is been around for a long time .,education
and weve been using ai and ai is integrated into everything that we do .,education
now i have been using ai for many different reason .,education
work time many different project .,education
teacher training is not new for me .,education
ive been doing that for closer thirty year .,education
and one of the thing i had biggest problem i had there in teacher training wa teaching teacher how to use technology in the classroom .,education
and without even thinking that it wa ai a too .,education
but ai a we know it today a lot of people relate that to chat gpt .,education
and i think weve it is exploded in the last year that we have gotten past chat gpt because there are many different chat box that we can go to .,education
there different we have different alternative now .,education
for ai we do not need chat gpt .,education
we can use many others .,education
and i think that teacher do need to get on board .,education
they needed to get on board with technology integration into the classroom that they needed to get on board with online learning and situation developed that we realize that we get need those skill .,education
theyll probably be able to get a lowerpaying job but i think company in the corporate world need instructor trainer and some teacher who are up to date with their ai skill .,education
it is not a game it is again not a warning not something to instilled fear into teacher because there nothing to be afraid of .,education
it is another skill that you have to add to your skill skillset to be an effective teacher .,education
they should be getting on board .,education
and any of the teacher here today follow me on social medium theyll see that i always post a lot of information about ai and different site to go to to learn more about it .,education
and of course ill be doing a series of webinars about ai and lesson planning and instructional design and how all those thing fit together .,education
ill be doing a workshop this coming weekend for the german association of community college .,education
they are having there and all that .,education
and yeah i think it is a skill that you have to add to all the other skill that we need to effectively teach in the classroom .,education
i understand thank you thank you very much rome .,education
i wanted to ask you another question it is not something about ai but differently it is the to term instructional design .,education
this is i should i know either about it .,education
what is it ?,education
what is the instructional design and what is the role of in education ?,education
a i said earlier i came from a corporate background and in the corporate world of learning and adult learning we use the term instructional design .,education
that is not new .,education
it is not a new term .,education
when you are a trainer and you are working with adult in a corporate learning environment you do need to know how to put a course or a workshop together .,education
and that mean that you are going to youve got to have some skill that you bring to the table and youve got to be very organized .,education
you have to know how to organize a workshop or some a course at a company .,education
and that mean that you have to know how to do need analysis .,education
and youve got to know what knowledge and skill those people at that company need .,education
and youve got to develop skill .,education
are you got to develop task and project around those that they can learn because adult need on hand learning and they need task in order to learn something .,education
and they do not have a lot of time .,education
and you also have to know what skill and competency they a participant need to bring to the table to learn effectively a a getting a sense of learning successfully .,education
this is important .,education
and this is what instructional designer do .,education
they know that .,education
and they also know that the learner are there to fulfill a need .,education
a gap that they have that they need this to go further in their career .,education
it is very connected to their work .,education
and they understand how people learn adult .,education
and we sometimes a teacher use term interchangeably that is wrong pedagogy .,education
and we do not realize it .,education
pedagogy is about how young people learn primary school secondary school maybe even university .,education
but people and company and adult we use thats andrew gaudy .,education
and thats different principle of the idea of teaching and learning .,education
how we teach adult might not work for how we need to teach young people .,education
this is why i never talk about young learner primary school because i do not know anything about that .,education
but i do know about secondary school about i do know .,education
and thats very different because what happens in a primary school is different than what happens in a secondary school .,education
and what happens in a university is also different .,education
but instructional design is it is i do not want to say it is a science .,education
it is a but you can get a degree in it .,education
you can go to school and learn it .,education
but i do not think you have to these day .,education
there many great thing on linkedin and social medium google .,education
there online course that you can take .,education
i think it is better if you specialize in something .,education
and whatever that you want to do an instructional design course in .,education
because before you collect and you still can study at that university .,education
again you do not have to .,education
i did study that i wanted to learn more about that .,education
and i did that in my mid 20 because this kid wa part of my job .,education
now teacher working in state school and language school private language school they probably know a little bit about instructional design because they are doing le in planning .,education
but le in planning is the beginning of instructional design .,education
but now with ai you need to know what instructional design is because you need to be able to put together a three hundred and sixty degree lesson plan .,education
and thats different than these lesson plan that you can find online which are cookie cut and you you are going to have to tailor them to your need and change them .,education
but and again this is something that i havent talked too much about .,education
but i will be talking about that in the next couple of month .,education
this what is the three hundred and sixty degree lesson plan ?,education
because instructional designer know what that is .,education
they have to know what that is .,education
again instruction design is a skill .,education
it is a job .,education
and it is a job for adult learner .,education
but you can use it for primary school and secondary school university .,education
it is mostly about the corporate world .,education
but teacher need to start learning how do they teach and learn in the corporate world .,education
because this is what we are preparing our learner for especially at university is to enter the corporate world .,education
and of course that lead u to another topic of the future learning future proofing many idea that come with where are our student going to be in five year when they leave our class at the university .,education
i am very much into future proofing and integrating that into what i do in the classroom with my business student .,education
because i do teach business student a . and i want to make sure that they are learning the skill that they need to survive and to work effectively and have success in their career .,education
and i take a very instructional design approach when i put those class together .,education
thank you .,education
thank you very much for the information that you provide u here about instructional design .,education
thank you very much .,education
and also if i am not wrong we can find more information in your linkedin page .,education
i think about instructional design .,education
you could go to i am not going to say that i am a specialist in that but i know what it is .,education
but if you want to go and learn more about that go to youtube and google instructional design .,education
and you are probably going to come up with the name devlin peck .,education
and he ha some of the best video on learning about what instructional design is and all the different step of that .,education
and if you take the time if you are a selfdirected selfregulated learner and thats who i cater to on social medium is that you will listen to those video and learn much .,education
theyll answer all your question .,education
devlin peck on youtube is the best teacher for instructional design .,education
and they are free .,education
the afterdecessions are definitely going check because i wonder what do you think you are much for the information about it ?,education
and you mentioned a term i wa going to ask you but you mentioned it is selfdirected learning you said .,education
and this also another very important term .,education
what is that ?,education
what is selfdirected learning ?,education
and yes .,education
let me give you a little maybe an analogy .,education
and that is that when a teacher walk into the room and no matter they are going to be teachercentered or studentcentered .,education
but it should be the goal of a teacher to make sure that their learner have a little bit of voice and choice in what take place in the classroom .,education
selfdirected learning is we might not see it but there are a lot not everybody learns the same .,education
and there are some people who are highly motivated .,education
and they do not need people to tell them what to do .,education
they know that intuitively .,education
they are instinctive with that .,education
and we can see that a teacher and state school and maybe even language school that people who are selfmotivated and always do the homework always do the task .,education
they are always there .,education
they are motivated .,education
we do not have to motivate them .,education
but selfdirected person empowers themselves .,education
they want to learn .,education
they learning and they have their own strategy of learning and they make decision for themselves .,education
they create activity and task for themselves to learn .,education
and they go out on into google on the internet .,education
and they find resource for themselves to learn .,education
and they to learn in group a lot of time .,education
some selfdirected learner learn by themselves .,education
but for them it is important to learning group .,education
theyll form little study group or something .,education
and we see that a at school .,education
and they are very effective in their learning strategy .,education
they know what work for them .,education
they know what doesnt work .,education
they know what they .,education
they know what they do not .,education
and they are very critical sometimes about what they are learning and how they are learning .,education
and they are usually the first one to give you feedback in the classroom .,education
because they know what they want .,education
and it is great to have learner that .,education
but not everyone is that way .,education
and maybe from what i said you might think that a selfdirected learner is an extravert .,education
but not always .,education
a lot of time they are introvert .,education
a lot of people think that i am some big whatever extravert in life speaking whatever .,education
but i am a very quiet person in my private life .,education
and it take a lot of energy and nerve for me to get up and speak in front of people even though ive done it many time .,education
but i am a selfdirected learner .,education
ive always been .,education
ive always made decision for myself and found way for myself .,education
and i always find other people me who learning who are selfmotivated we do not have to motivate ourselves .,education
and when you are a selfdirect and i think teacher dream of having a classroom filled with selfdirected learner .,education
but if you have if you are lucky enough and i have in my life in my career to have a lot of selfdirected learner i turn those learner into my assistance in the classroom because they want extra task .,education
they want something else to do because they already know whats happening .,education
they are in touch with everything .,education
they have a very high sense of reality .,education
and again they know what they want .,education
and they are always the one who step forward and ask if you need any help or anything .,education
and i always take advantage of that because we are going to have different kind of learner in our classroom .,education
and you definitely want to seek out the selfdirected learner .,education
and do not think that they are the extravert because sometimes the extravert are not always the selfdirected learner .,education
but it is the great thing to have a selfdirected learner in your classroom .,education
you became also if anything about the teacher site also teacher become motivated .,education
i think if i am not wrong we also become more motivated to see this have directed learner in your classroom .,education
i think we want to believe that maybe it is something we do in the classroom that lead them to selfdirected learning .,education
and then they want to be part of their learning process .,education
and when you are working with the adult adult do not usually talk about all those thing especially in the corporate world .,education
but student there is a social aspect of learning where they do share private thing with one another .,education
and this is why collaborative learning is extremely important to keep student motivated .,education
and hopefully if who you are highly motivated selfdirected learner are and you make sure that you separate them correctly in group when you are doing collaborative learning you can make selfdirected learning contagious if how to work with that .,education
but it take a while i think to understand how that work .,education
and again it is not something you are going to learn one day after leaving university .,education
you got to get into the classroom and start learning what learning is about and the dynamic of learning .,education
but definitely selfdirected learning is one of those phenomenon that happens in learning .,education
something that we all wish for because in the end i think it is important that we see that our learner are doing thing by themselves .,education
they are making good decision for themselves .,education
and we have to be on the side guiding the and managing the process of learning .,education
and when you get to that point when your classroom can manage itself then youve got a group of selfdirected learner .,education
thank you .,education
thank you ron for giving a lot of information about selfdirected learning to u . thank you very much .,education
and i would to move to another question .,education
i know that you have youve been giving lot of presentation or training session in your career far .,education
when you think about them session or presentation physically face to face what wa over the most interesting situation or situation that you faced ?,education
this interesting doesnt always mean something positive .,education
but maybe i said that interesting but if you want to say something vice versa another problem .,education
because i can say something on both side there .,education
i think it is interesting that a lot of teacher i have a face book side called webinars for english teacher which we have about thirty fivezero teacher there all over the world who come there and i always post free webinars that are taking place and whatever .,education
now during corona that wa important because a lot of teacher got to get a lot of information that they needed to to help them get through corona .,education
and i met a lot of great people from that site all over the world .,education
and i have to say that one of the thing that is something i noticed that maybe i did not wa that teacher signed up for a webinar and they do not even know how zoom work .,education
they do not know how to work microsoft .,education
they do not know how to work word .,education
they do not know how to work google .,education
and they do not realize that if you are going to be doing online learning especially you a a teacher you have to have those skill .,education
you have to bring those skill to the table and you do not have to be a master at them but you should know the basic .,education
this make it complicated and frustrating .,education
and i am going to be quite honest with you .,education
i throw those people out now because i can not deal with it anymore .,education
i get impatient with it .,education
and on the good side there many teacher out there that this is the one thing that make me feel that i do feel i am filling a niche in the market .,education
i feel very uncomfortable asking for money and making people pay for thing .,education
but and i know that everybody there part of africa north africa the middle east india and southeast asia south america central america and the other teacher that follow me come from these country and these geographical area of the world .,education
and they do not have money to pay for all these expensive webinars .,education
and i believe that if you are a teacher and you your job it a a career for yourself that you are going to take the opportunity thats offered to you from some of the website that i run .,education
and i make sure that i run a clean ship .,education
i do not let a lot of spam on there .,education
i check whats on those side .,education
you will see that even on my social medium site mean personally .,education
i do not put private thing there politics picture of meme that are crazy or whatever of cat and squirrel and dog or whatever .,education
it is focused about education and pedagogical thing a technology ai .,education
and free webinars where you can learn because i do believe that if you want to be an effective teacher in the classroom money is not a barrier .,education
there are many thing out there that are for free .,education
take advantage of those thing .,education
and i know i have me .,education
and i want to make sure that teacher know that that you do not need to have a lot of money to learn and to get better and be a better teacher in the classroom and to learn how to improve your team back .,education
and even your content knowledge i think teacher we are teaching grammar syllabus oriented class .,education
they definitely are going to have a problem because this morning i googled english online grammar and got i think two hundred and fifty million result .,education
why would somebody teach you to teach them grammar when they can get it for free on google on the internet ?,education
and ill go to youtube .,education
now i know there a lot of influencers out there who are making money from that .,education
but usually they are making money not because they are selling the class .,education
it is because they have some great grammar lesson that are free and they make money from the advertising .,education
but they are not trying to exaggerate .,education
you are a agree .,education
and wrong there a question from the follower .,education
can i ask it ?,education
i will divert into the screen .,education
brack is asking how do you blend culture and realize context into language teaching ?,education
i am going to have to turn that question around in is how do you not deal with culture and you are doing language teaching ?,education
because language is about culture .,education
and if you are teaching english this becomes more difficult because it doesnt make a difference if you are doing arabic or spanish or german .,education
german is the most widely spoken language in europe .,education
on the continent .,education
english is there is german a language forunk there english a language forunk spanish .,education
look how many country spanish is spoken in .,education
there many .,education
and if you look at spanish id to start with spanish .,education
not everyone who speaks spanish share the same culture .,education
not everyone who speaks arabic share the same culture .,education
not everyone who speaks english share the same culture .,education
you do need to understand cultural aspect of language .,education
and learning about learning a new language is definitely going to open your eye to how other culture work how people see themselves .,education
you can not separate the two .,education
you can not try to do that .,education
but i think it make for a very dry learning experience because culture is a very integral part of language learning .,education
and teacher make that decision for themselves whether they are going to teach british english .,education
and i always think that thats strange because if you are going to teach british english have you lived in a country ?,education
what do about the culture ?,education
is it theoretical ?,education
i think i am always shocked if how many people have these idea of the united state but it is all from hollywood movie .,education
it is not reality when they start to realize what it is .,education
they are shocked in a lot of way .,education
ive traveled throughout the north africa in the middle east .,education
and i know that there a big difference between morocco and egypt saudi arabia and united arab emirate these are different culture .,education
and a lot of them in under their different dialect of arabic .,education
youve got to know about culture .,education
and you should always teach about culture and not the difference that we have but the similarity that we have a to .,education
i think thats important .,education
thank you .,education
thank you very much for the answer .,education
let move to another another question for one .,education
ron how do yourself in ten year ?,education
will you still be doing this job or are you going to throw in other job ?,education
i noticed that there somebody there in her name is grace .,education
i noticed that we came to something .,education
and grace life in mexico .,education
shes from argentina .,education
and i lived in work in mexico .,education
and i have a home in the united state .,education
i have a home in spain .,education
i have a home in germany a . i hope that if everything go to plan i will definitely enjoy my retirement and travel to my different home .,education
and definitely make sure that i get a house a . a little apartment in mexico .,education
it is part of what i to do .,education
and i am going to probably retire in a few year .,education
but i do not think i am going to quit teaching .,education
i think thats somebody blood after a while .,education
i that .,education
but i know ill probably do webinars still .,education
but germany cold .,education
and i do not the winter here .,education
thats what i our house in spain .,education
and it is getting our my house in the united state in texas .,education
it is very hot there .,education
i do not think i am going to retire there .,education
but definitely what travel .,education
i think maybe even in five year i am going to enjoy my retirement .,education
there also another comment there from anthony .,education
i know antonio is a friend .,education
he say thank you to you .,education
and for the thing that you have taught him .,education
it is a wonderful to see this comment here .,education
and let me ask you another question room .,education
it is sometimes people whod to have in some difficult situation all irish i could have that superpower and to deal with this problem with people sadist .,education
when you think about yourself if you could have one superpower to use in the class victor a a teacher what would it be and how would it help you ?,education
i think i wish i could have a superpower of mind reading .,education
that i could read the mind of my learner and understand them .,education
not because i want to know everything about them but definitely well to know whats in their mind ?,education
what did they want ?,education
because our learner do not always express what they want .,education
and all the year that ive had in experience in the classroom what they say to you might not be what they want .,education
and i think if you had the superpower of mind reading that you are able you do not need to do what need analysis .,education
i think you should start going with what they want .,education
yeah what they need .,education
the learner do not always know what they need .,education
theyll tell you what they want .,education
but what they want is not always what they need .,education
and also getting into the mind of people to understand how what is important to get motivated into the learning process .,education
i think it is a lot easier with adult .,education
i think anyone who a primary school teacher i do not think that we a other teacher recognize the very difficult job that they have .,education
because they are doing more than teaching .,education
they are socializing young people .,education
their job is different than what we do in secondary school and at the university or the corporate world .,education
it is important to i said we are talking about superpower here .,education
i definitely would to be able to give you a reminder of my own .,education
thank you .,education
thank you very much for your superpower to tell us. . and by the way two question left .,education
the time fly from this the wonderful moment we are having here .,education
thanks to you .,education
and let me ask you the first question before the last one .,education
let finish this interview and you step outside the home and find a lot of ticket and up with the ten million what would you do ?,education
first of all chen nili is not very much money .,education
i think money is good .,education
it wa not a long money. . but i probably would give half a bit away .,education
but do not need that much money .,education
you i already planted my tree and already have my car and have my house .,education
and i thought it is not a if i need to buy a new furniture or anything nothing that .,education
i probably would get a personal trainer and i am nutritionist and a cook to cook for me in my retirement .,education
but i know probably i would probably give half of it away .,education
and i know where i would give it away too .,education
but it would all be to people who one thing i learned during corona is i did not realize everybody think germany a very rich country .,education
and it is .,education
it is the economic powerhouse of europe .,education
but there are still a lot of people here in germany who do not have access to the internet who do not have a laptop who do not have an iphone .,education
here we are talking on an iphone .,education
i am talking to you for my iphone .,education
but corona made me open my eye to that and i worked on a project to make sure that we could get a many laptop to a many teenager a possible to make sure they had the same chance to learn a everybody else .,education
and that wa an eyeopening experience for me .,education
i think that we should not forget that no matter where we live at there going to be people who need to have access to the internet need the equipment and we need to do what we can to help them .,education
and not in the sense that i pity them but because i want to give to people what wa given to me i to get back what wa given to me .,education
ive met a lot of great people in my life whove been great mentor great teacher and they gave a lot to me .,education
and when i am in the classroom i try to remember them .,education
and i know that one of my mentor i do not think she ever let me pay for lunch .,education
she always paid out of her own money .,education
sort it it would be giving back .,education
if i am on the ten million yes i would probably give after that .,education
thank you .,education
and here is the last question and i think the the real difficult one .,education
and what is your motto ?,education
if you follow me on social medium you probably should already know the answer to that question .,education
and i believe that when you are grown up and act a grownup that youve got to be critical about thing .,education
youve got to scrutinize thing .,education
youve got to break thing down and ask question and not accept everything thats thrown at you .,education
and if you make decision for your own selfdevelopment and personal growth .,education
and this is why i have on my linkedin side learning for the discernment .,education
because we need to be more discerning about what we learn and what we need to learn and make good decision in that way .,education
and thats my motto is learning for the discerning .,education
ive made some mistake in decision that ive made for myself about learning .,education
but i think ive made more good decision than bad decision .,education
i think the bad decision were based on i made them in the last minute .,education
do think about it .,education
and the one that i think about i do it .,education
i consider myself a discerning person .,education
and i think we a teacher need to be discerning about our learning .,education
thats my motto .,education
learning for that sir .,education
this learning .,education
thank you .,education
thank you very much ron .,education
thank you very much .,education
thats all my question ron .,education

thank you .,education
hello and welcome to a special podcast about an extraordinary time .,education
my name is ro taylor and ill be talking to some of the people who helped transform early childhood education in eastern and central europe starting in the 1990s how they did it and what they learned .,education
well be discussing a new book early childhood education in social and political transition which take an indepth look at the groundbreaking stepbystep programme .,education
joining me is one of the author sarah klaus who is one of the leader of this open society foundation programme and is now affiliated with georgetown university centre for child and human development .,education
along with iveta silova associate dean of global engagement at arizona state university .,education
hello and it is great to be here .,education
thanks for having u . and also with u is carmen lika director of the stepbystep centre for education and professional development in romania .,education
thank you .,education
it is a great pleasure to be here .,education
let begin at the beginning .,education
after the fall of the berlin wall george soros decided to make a major investment in early childhood education probably the biggest ever .,education
that wa the stepbystep programme funded by the open society foundation .,education
sarah what did he hope to achieve ?,education
at that time across the region in central eastern europe the open society foundation had a network of independent foundation established in almost every country .,education
and the aim of these foundation wa to hasten the transformation to vibrant open democratic society .,education
george soros always invested heavily in education programme and at the time that this programme wa established he wa interested in starting a university .,education
he wa convinced by dr fraser mustard who ran a social science institute in canada that he needed to be investing in young child in order to transform these society .,education
there wa incredible brain research coming out at the time and he wa very convinced by that and made a commitment to invest one hundred million in the stepbystep programme .,education
come in early childhood education wa very different in eastern central europe and eurasia at that time .,education
give u a sense of what it wa to be a pupil in those classroom to be a small child in those classroom .,education
it wa different from what we did and what we accomplished with stepbystep .,education
although early childhood education wa a very strong component of the education system at that time across the eastern bloc it had multiple function and most of them were social function .,education
both the nursery and the preschool programme provided protection for child and the place for parent to leave their child .,education
it wa a way that the state freed the parent in order for both mother and father to be able to work .,education
they mostly provided healthcare and social protection a ive already said and not many child development and learning opportunity .,education
also it wa a very very big focus in getting the child ready to go to school .,education
it wa about shaping the child to be behaved and a good citizen but there wa very little emphasis on the child personal development .,education
yes the individual child did not exist .,education
it wa a model that all the child had to fit and had to accomplish .,education
stepbystep drew on the head start programme in the u . sarah tell u about that because you were heavily involved in it .,education
yes at the time when mr. soros came back from his meeting in canada liz laurent at the open society foundation wa tasked with developing the stepbystep programme and she contacted colleague that she had met at georgetown university who were providing technical assistance to the head start programme .,education
now head start turned out to be a fantastic model for the stepbystep programme .,education
it is a programme that emerged a the national programme to support early childhood development under president johnson a part of the war on poverty .,education
and it is a programme that support holistic childcentered inclusive early childhood development .,education
and it is a programme that provides the state with block grant to do that and allows them a lot of flexibility .,education
it wa a great model for stepbystep which we were trying to implement initially in fifteen country and later in thirty country .,education
in the book a we were doing the interview we asked one question that interested jan very much wa why we did not pick one of the democratic pedagogy in europe of which there are many .,education
but the head start programme i think wa first of all accessible to the foundation .,education
but it also had the capacity to do what we needed to do .,education
we needed to start in fifteen country at once .,education
we needed thirty trainer .,education
and it also had a wonderful focus on social justice and inclusivity that underpinned the programme .,education
yves when you first began to work with stepbystep in central asia what were some of the challenge you encountered ?,education
central asia wa a fascinating place .,education
and i wanted to maybe from the very beginning remind everybody that the whole area of the former soviet union eastern central europe is not one homogeneous blog the socialist blog a many people refer to .,education
but it is a diverse place and with very deep local history and culture and different political trajectory .,education
and central asia wa a fascinating place to be in .,education
but it also probably wa one of the most difficult place to work in because the preschool or early childhood education infrastructure wa already fairly modest compared to the other country in the former socialist blog .,education
but it completely collapsed after the soviet union collapsed .,education
and maybe the reason one of the reason wa because the early childhood infrastructure wa in large part supported by private industry .,education
the enterprise owned kindergarten that were very popular .,education
and during the transition period the privatisation of industry affected also this infrastructure of early childhood education because a enterprise began to be privatised preschool were the first one to be shed and sold off .,education
the building would be sold off .,education
and that resulted in very devastating effect for family and for child .,education
that early childhood education infrastructure probably wa the first one to collapse in this broader education sphere .,education
and the teacher were leaving because the salary were low .,education
and it wa quite a dire situation from the get go .,education
but it also wa a fascinating place to work because on the other hand there wa also a major political will and the desire maybe more broadly among the public to bring back some of this infrastructure ?,education
that wa important .,education
that wa i would say that central asia maybe had more political will compared to other context to engage with the step by step programme but also with other education transformation programme and explore all of the possibility that were on the table at that time .,education
it wa both very dire situation but also an exciting the one with lot of exciting opening .,education
you found that education minister were quite keen to help you in the end .,education
wa that why ?,education
because they were keen to build up this the early childhood infrastructure that had been broken down ?,education
that wa one of the reason .,education
i think another reason wa because the philosophy of the step by step also resonated very deeply with many people both academic and politician who were brought up maybe only these more philosophical idea of bigotskis that they recognised almost immediately in a step by step programme a ?,education
i think there were some element of the programme that resonated immediately and very deeply with academic but also politician in the region .,education
this ability to connect maybe the key element of the programme with the historical context with some of the maybe philosophical idea that would resonate .,education
i think step by step had amazing people that were able to make a lot of bridge and lay the ground for successful implementation of the programme .,education
in the book there a vivid sense of the excitement and purpose around step by step which youve youve alluded to there .,education
in the early day carmen what wa that to be a part of ?,education
it wa quite an adventure .,education
i wa a student and my colleague at that time wa a dentist we were known a the student and the dentist when we first started .,education
we after the initial training that we participated at in the united state we went to the ministry of education to inform them officially about the programme and the plan and the ministry of education wa a student come to ruin the tradition .,education
and all the teacher in the first nine preschool who were excited to learn more and to change the practice and what they were doing that they could offer the child they were working with the best opportunity to learn and to reach their full potential .,education
it wa a curiosity a professional curiosity and desire to do more to do better and to get the child ready for the life that wa opening in front of everybody .,education
tell u about some of the change that the programme made in these setting .,education
it changed the whole approach from the teachercentred to the childcentred approach and that wa a real a huge challenge .,education
i would keep in mind the professional curiosity and desire to learn and change the life of the child .,education
child with disability and rom child were very much marginalised in the education system in these country .,education
sarah give u a sense of how they were treated .,education
there wa a profound structural barrier for both group of child to participate even to participate i will not even say to participate equally in education system .,education
and for rom child i would say it is even a profound if not more profound but especially there wa an enormous and remains an enormous amount of discrimination against rom child across and here i would say not only central eastern europe but also europe a a whole .,education
and i do want to emphasise that many country in europe were also around this time trying to figure out how to integrate and include rom child and traveller child for example in the united kingdom where i live now into education system .,education
rom child many rom child speak a different language at home and they would go to school when they were entering they did not have opportunity to participate in preschool education .,education
the number of rom child participating in preschool education in the 1990s wa very small .,education
many child dropped out a because of the discrimination that they experienced in school .,education
it wa a dire situation .,education
and to emphasise some of the country that step by step wa working in romania where carmen is bulgaria hungary czech republic slovakia these are country with very high number for high percentage of rom people .,education
having them not participate in education is hugely detrimental to the whole society .,education
carmen how did step by step try to change all this ?,education
it wa introduced a an inclusive program from the very beginning from it very first day to the ministry of education to the county school inspectorate who are the local authority to all the teacher and parent that we worked with .,education
we understood very quickly that the early childhood is the best entry point to reduce the difference to recognise and reduce the difference in approaching rom and child with disability .,education
a sara mentioned child with disability were not even considered to be enrolled in regular classroom .,education
they were either kept at home or enrolled in special classroom .,education
we made it very clear that we open enrolment for all child with partner with social service in the first nine city we started and that wa a practice that continued .,education
child with different vulnerability were enrolled in the step by step program while we supported the teacher with training and working with child that come from different cultural background child with disability and we also offered them onsite support coaching besides the training .,education
the training focused on the democratic value such a inclusion and tolerance and diversity and recognising the difference and understanding that it is to be different .,education
for young child it wa natural to have different colleague to work to play with different kind of child and it became natural for parent .,education
and this is how we built a critical mass of people both professional and family and social service that rolled on and moved forward with this idea .,education
and we came to a point where the ministry of education used to refer parent of child with disability to go to step by step classroom because this is where they will get the best opportunity for their child .,education
of course there were setback .,education
not everything changed a much a you wanted it to a quickly a you wanted it to .,education
i would say that this wa a program of persistence and learning in the fall after the first training took place over the summer when u.s. trainer went back to visit program in central eastern europe .,education
everybody wa excited .,education
it wa a huge change in all the classroom but they started to notice that teacher were still asking child who were lefthanded to write with their hand or child were still standing in line to go to the toilet .,education
they werent being treated a individual .,education
and we realized that there were still a lot of thing to do .,education
a new methodology a whole new training package wa created and delivered to support teacher to think about these nuance of democratic education that maybe we hadnt thought about at first .,education
i would say that we werent able to change everything that we wanted to change but we never stopped trying .,education
we had a saying who say we can not change the world ?,education
and that wa the motto that the whole program lived by with this expectation somehow that an education program in early childhood could make a huge difference .,education
and step by step eventually moved out of preschool and primary school and it sought to influence inservice training and preservice training in university and training college .,education
sarah how did those institution which had often been doing the same thing for a long time react to that ?,education
we included representative from the university in all of the training from the beginning but only in small number .,education
and we realized after a few year that that wasnt going to change the university system and wasnt going to change how teacher were trained .,education
it wasnt going to change what we call the inservice training system which is how teacher get participate in retraining .,education
and in the region it wa often every three or four year they would participate in a retraining program .,education
we started a higher education program part of the persistence program and developed eight semesterlength course for university and then provided those course through training to about twozero people in the across university and pedagogic institute and inservice training institute .,education
and here i would say i think it inspired individual professional to change their course .,education
in a few university we know that it inspired a particular certificate program or a change in the training program but it did not have the huge effect that we wanted .,education
and i think in retrospect maybe we could have focused on specific institution of higher education and focused on training those .,education
but i do think it changed and introduced some new idea into the academic of early childhood education a a whole .,education
and i think that that ha served a a foundation for other work going forward .,education
and in the end you moved far beyond europe and eurasia did not you ?,education
yeah the program at open society foundation ended up a a global program working around the world .,education
and the stepbystep program wa one project that wa influential in some of our activity .,education
i think in the book we write about the work of the open society foundation in bhutan and also in liberia .,education
i would say that what we learned wa that the program wa hugely influential or had had relevance even in context where the education system wa very different .,education
i should mention also that the program wa operated from the early year in haiti and for a time also in south africa where open society foundation had and still i think ha national foundation .,education
this book is a reflection on stepbystep what it did achieve what it did not .,education
looking back ivetta what might have been done differently ?,education
this is a huge question and probably another book could be written about this question alone .,education
but i wanted to pick up maybe on the question on the discussion that sarah started a little bit earlier about the preservice and inservice teacher education in school .,education
i think this perhaps could be one area that could have been done could have been approached differently ?,education
but a sarah said it wa a major learning process for the program itself .,education
but i wanted to point out that this wa a problem that wa very typical for most of the international development project at that time .,education
many resource in the early 1990s and beyond went into school to offer direct support to teacher and student and offer this very direct immediate assistance on the ground .,education
and higher education institution became an afterthought in a lot of international development assistance program ?,education
they were perceived by many people a these black hole where nobody wanted to invest any money because nobody would know what would happen with this money and these huge bureaucracy .,education
but in a way i think that international development assistance replicated maybe some of the also problem that we have in western europe and north america or western education more broadly which is based on this research to practice divide ?,education
this logic maybe wa automatically transferred also to international development context ?,education
where the school and preschool were separated from what wa happening in term of research or in term of teacher education program .,education
and i think when people started to not only in step by step but in many other program started to realize that school are changing fast .,education
but preservice teacher training institution are producing exactly the same teacher a they were fifty year ago .,education
i think this is when this maybe realization became more pronounced and also the urge to address it became more urgent .,education
but i wonder what would have happened if from the very beginning the teacher and researcher and faculty member in high education institution work together and owned the program and the transformation together a a collective .,education
i wonder if thing would have been different .,education
and i think that it wa a unique moment in time because everything seemed to have been thrown up in the air in the early 1990s when many institution were collapsing .,education
i think it wa a unique opportunity to try something different but we did not but we did it later ?,education
and i think there were lot of a sarah mentioned earlier opportunity to learn and also opportunity for these western expert who were part of the program to learn how program could be done differently including at home in the united state or in europe .,education
i think it wa a good learning experience for everybody involved both people in eastern and central europe and the former soviet union but also all of the colleague from the west a . it wa mutual wasnt one way .,education
carmen you run an ngo which wa established through the stepbystep program .,education
what wa your experience of setting it up ?,education
that wa a learning and growth experience .,education
we had a change in management of the national soros foundation in late one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven .,education
and when the new management team came in they called me and they said you have about three month to put together an ngo .,education
i did not have experience in running ngo developing ngo .,education
i put together a team of people and we had to go through a legislation that dated at that time from one thousand nine hundred and twenty four in romania .,education
that wa how the civil society organization were legally organized .,education
and we started early one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight .,education
probably the biggest challenge throughout the whole process wa to keep expanding the stepbystep program and maintaining the high quality of the program while developing the ngo and building a strategy for the ngo a a whole not only for the program .,education
and that wa one of the biggest challenge .,education
i am very grateful for all the support that we received from the early childhood program with all the training and the coach and the mentor and the resource and also from the national foundation .,education
i think it wa a learning opportunity for everybody .,education
and where is stepbystep in romania now ?,education
it is an ngo celebrating twenty five year of existence and thirty year of stepbystep .,education
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four we started with the preschool program .,education
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five we were amongst the few one who said yes to the parent who wanted their child to continue in stepbystep program and we started with one classroom of primary school program .,education
and the number of group of preschool classroom and primary school classroom ha grown steadily ever since .,education
we are now active in six hundred kindergarten nationwide and over onezero primary school classroom .,education
we also adapted the stepbystep principle and value to public school who wanted to transform themselves in stepbystep school .,education
we are also working with the first five big university in romania in developing a course on alternative education .,education
stepbystep program is officially recognized in romania since one thousand nine hundred and ninety five a an educational alternative .,education
and we are also working with the national association of the pedagogical high school which are the institution who train the educational professional for nursery .,education
this is in a nutshell where stepbystep is now in romania .,education
it is everywhere in other word almost everywhere .,education
and we also i think we were very very involved in advocating and designing the legislation for early childhood in romania .,education
eveta you mentioned earlier this is a stepbystep is a remarkable example of eastwest policy borrowing .,education
what did you personally learn from it ?,education
stepbystep is a fascinating case study .,education
for anybody who interested in comparative education i think this would be a interesting case to explore by reading the book which ha many excerpt from interview with different stakeholder that were involved .,education
it wa listening to a lot of familiar voice to me when i wa reading .,education
it is a great case study .,education
but i think that and there are many lesson that could be learned from it but for me personally let me step back for a second .,education
policy borrowing and lending is often critiquing this prepackaged education reform that are transferred from the west to the east or north to the south .,education
but i think this case of stepbystep program is interesting where the reform ha been transferred but it ha been extremely adaptable and on an ongoing basis adapting to the local context ?,education
changing in response to the concern or the interest of the local stakeholder and community ?,education
much more i would say open ended and reflective program that kept learning a it wa going a sarah mentioned also earlier and carmen a . i think also what it program showed is that this borrowing process is not one way transfer ?,education
but it is an ongoing mutual learning process where both the called quoteunquote expert and the local stakeholder learn together and create something new in the process .,education
but i think maybe one of the most interesting lesson to me wa how this program created dense network of academic and practitioner not only regionally but also on a worldwide scale ?,education
now we have you can see collaboration that are happening across the four socialist region .,education
you can see collaboration that are happening worldwide .,education
it ended up changing the culture of education and created these absolutely powerful network that exist now and that continue to advocate for policy change for even broader cultural change in the context where they are working .,education
sarah open society ha stopped funding step by step but the program left an indelible mark on the country that took part a a on europe and eurasia a a whole .,education
do you still see the step by step imprint there ?,education
i think one of the big achievement of the program wa developing or supporting the development of a vibrant civil society in early childhood education and development .,education
and it is become the goto professional association in the field and is advocating and holding on to the value that underpinned and underpinned the step by step program when it wa established in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three one thousand nine hundred and ninety four .,education
and we see element of the program woven in .,education
and i think these network also helped knit together east and west europe in a early childhood education academic sense .,education
i think thats also been a important part of the program .,education
and i think also one that show how eastern europe can lead in bringing those academic and practitioner community together which is not always seen .,education
i think a ivette wa mentioning we also often see this idea of western europe coming and doing thing with eastern europe .,education
but this wa an example of eastern europe taking an initiative and seeing it through to create something for all of europe and eurasia .,education
it is been a fascinating and quite inspirational discussion .,education

because i am doing the cutback business .,education
i am in the if god blessed me i to keep the blessing .,education
i am a wife told me we wa going down side .,education

yeah what car wasnt ?,education
i do not suppose it wa new .,education
that wouldve been nice .,education
i lived in that and i lived in a bonneville .,education
that wa the worst place .,education
i when i think back in a poorest place ive lived a a house i grew up in .,education
but at the time i did not know that .,education
it wa poor for the course .,education
it wa one of the house on the block .,education
everybody lived that .,education
i thought it wa i thought this how you live .,education
you thirteen people in one bathroom room .,education
you are not thought that wa it .,education
but because you did not know any different at the time .,education
because i wa saying i grew up poor .,education
but at the time if youve never ridden anything but at fifty eight volkswagen if youve never been in a cadillac you do not know the difference ?,education
you think this is the way it is .,education
hey who went to church in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight bell last stationway ?,education
and that wa my first car in seventy five .,education
my daddy gave me a one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight bell last stationway .,education
and that wa my first car .,education
hey it wa a car went to church in it. . you were born in west virginia .,education
and it wa that wa not a real affluent time in your life .,education
but there were seventy all ?,education
how many kid were in your family ?,education
it wa five kid .,education
there were seven in the family .,education
did everybody work in contribute when you were growing up ?,education
yeah that wa a must .,education
wouldnt have free rise in my daddy house .,education
when you we did not have a lot of thing tough that .,education
ive had a ive had paper route .,education
and and pop bottle hustle every since i wa ten .,education
ive wondered many time if thats the reason you and i got along fast .,education
because weve talked about before and i threw paper route .,education
i picked up pop bottle and you get a nickel for some and you get a dime for others .,education
and put them together .,education
and weve had some of those same experience .,education
i do not know about you but i would not want my kid to go through that .,education
but i do not mind that i did .,education
it is with me that i went through that at the time .,education
i wouldnt want to do it again .,education
but and i wouldnt want my kid to do it .,education
you look at everything youve gone through .,education
i used to oftentimes question god all the time man .,education
why is my life this ?,education
a i got older when i wa a kid it wasnt the question .,education
but when i got older and homeless and all thats a god what is this about man ?,education
look come on .,education
enough is enough .,education
but everything you are going through is preparing you for whats to come .,education
you and i needed the pop bottle moment the paper route .,education
you and i needed that .,education
we could become who we are .,education
now we grew up and we do not want our child to have that .,education
they do not have to go through the same thing that we went through .,education
and then thats a challenge i find for a lot of people who are doing better now .,education
because you give much to your kid that they miss some of them valuable lesson that you had to learn along the way .,education
and then you start thinking to yourself did i give them too much ?,education
whats the cutoff point ?,education
and i rattle with that all the time with my kid .,education
because my kid did not fight on the way .,education
my kid went to school with a jacket that had a patch on it .,education
with the blue shirt and uniform .,education
they got the merit .,education
and they went to detention .,education
and it wa over with for me .,education
school over with for me my detention that the mayor wa somebody had to demere it waiting on me in the playground .,education
because when the bail rang i am kicking some tail .,education
and yours is it today ?,education
my kid did not have to go through that because they had a room with a bathroom with it .,education
they owned bathroom .,education
yeah they are owned bathroom .,education
i one of the thing that you told me long time ago we talked about it on on microphone one time that ha stuck with me .,education
and ive told a lot of people about it .,education
you had when you got older and got out into comedy you told me about what you called your turnback moment .,education
when you you were living in an addict .,education
and it wa a turnback moment that and i wish you would talk about that a little bit .,education
because it seems to me that you were within hour of having to go back home and get back into an hourly job instead of going to the apollo .,education
because no look man i said it before .,education
everybody i do not kill who you are is going to have that turnback moment .,education
everybody is on path on track to a destination .,education
everybody nobody is without dream and vision .,education
but somewhere along that dream of vision you are going to have a moment where you can either continue or you turn back .,education
the sad truth of the matter is too many people turn back .,education
my turnback moment wa i wa out there doing comedy .,education
i wa homeless .,education
and i had had enough that day .,education
and i wa washing up in a hotel .,education
and i wa in there and i used to go to fancy hotel to wash up because they had actual wash clothes rolled up in a little basket .,education
and i used to wet them and take them in the toilet and put soap all over my body .,education
and i went to the coast clear and i went to the coast clear and i went to the mountain and go back in there and wipe off and then put my clothes on .,education
and that wa my bath .,education
that morning a convention wa in town .,education
when i got to soap i went in there to soap up .,education
a convention wa in town and i guess they had let out for a break and people kept coming in the bathroom and i am sitting there .,education
and i got this soap on me and it is drying .,education
and i can not get back out there to get no fresh get no fresh cloth to wash. and the soap is drying on me and i flipped the toilet lid down and i sat there and i started cry .,education
i said this is it man .,education
i can not do this no more .,education
this comedy thing aint working out .,education
i aint making enough money to take care of my family .,education
i am gon na call my father told me once you leave here you can not come back home .,education
call my own man and cut a deal with him .,education
see if he let me come back home for six month and get me a regular job .,education
let me give up on this comedy thing .,education
and when they are bathroom finally cleared out i wa able to wash off .,education
i went to get in the car and before i called my daddy i had an answering machine up in the attic at my mother and father house .,education
they let me plug up and i called that answering machine and i wa about to give up and i said i called the machine and it said hey this is chuck sutton from show time with your apollo .,education

and man i wa devastated .,education
i said god look at this guy to be a sign from god show enough to give up now .,education
because i get to one crack to be on tv and i can not even get there .,education
i set out in the car man and tear is coming down my face man .,education

the flight my first time ever on tv showtime at the apollo .,education
i still got to shirt .,education
i walked out .,education
i got a stand in ovation .,education
i can not stop cry .,education

and the reason i couldnt stop cry because two day ago i wa finna turn back .,education
two day ago i wa finna call my daddy and give up .,education
two day ago had that happened .,education
i am not here talking to you today .,education
and that turned back moment man that gave me the faith and understand and how god work .,education
but if you are hanging there you do not know who in god going flip the switch .,education
and he flipped the switch ?,education
because he saw me finna call .,education
he knew i wa serious .,education
he said this dude finna give up .,education
but he had orchestrated the whole thing .,education
and i did not turn back .,education
and that moment changed my life .,education
because when i got on tv on showtime to apollo that wa to be getting everything .,education
man ive been on tv every six .,education
you hung in and you did not do it .,education
and that three hundred buck you could have taken that and gone home .,education
but man thats why i say to people all the time .,education
quit and guarantee you one thing .,education
it aint going to happen .,education
thats the guarantee of quitting .,education
hang in there .,education
resides this little thing thats required .,education
all you need is a check the hope .,education
the hope .,education
faith is the substance of thing hopeful and the evidence of thing not seen .,education
all you hope thats all faith is .,education
it is hope .,education
and the harder you hope the more faith you got the more faith you have the more faith you have .,education
but you got to put a lot of elbow grease with it too .,education
i want to ask you let take a quick break .,education

and it is about something i want to tell you that stephen i have in common here in a minute .,education

i am going to let you have it in the teeth .,education
and ive always been that way .,education
i wanted to stay authentically me .,education
and i think people responded to that .,education

a lot of email coming in .,education
dr. fielding insulted him by telling him he needed to man up .,education
man that made all the sense in the world of me .,education
and thats pretty much how i try to be .,education
when i turned that corner at family feud you said i never met these people .,education
i do not know who they are .,education
i try to be relatable .,education
but if i can not relate i am going to tell you that part too .,education
it wa interesting to me in watching that unfold .,education
because if you remember you and marjorie were at our house the night you had to make the decision of whether to do family feud or not .,education
you were thinking about talking about it .,education
we were back in my office .,education
and that wa a night .,education
it wa a deadline .,education
you had to tell him whether you are going to do it or not .,education
and they were pushing you hard .,education
and we talked about the fact that the game show the game part of it .,education
thats part of it .,education
you said it is a survey .,education
but it gave you a chance to be you .,education
the game is a backdrop .,education
it wa a platform for you to be who you are .,education
and let them keep score .,education
you go down the line .,education
and you it is you work in the front row of a comedy show. . thats all it is .,education
man family feud a huge part of his success is i i turned it into a comedy show instead of a guy .,education
and nobody had ever done that with a game show .,education
a game show ha a set format and thats it .,education
family feud is a game about a survey .,education
top one hundred people survey said here would they think who care ?,education
i am and ill tell you what wa making me have that trouble at your house that night .,education
they had sent me a tape of the guy before me .,education

and the whole said let see if it is up there .,education
and i said to myself here you talking about what do you mean let see if it is up there ?,education

but people know you from what you do and what they see on the air .,education
but i know you a a real person .,education
i know you a a husband and a father and a real person away from the camera and who you are and what you believe and what youve struggled to overcome .,education
and i know who you are and i know how much you have to offer to this country and keeping this country on track and online .,education
and i did not name this network by accident .,education
i did not reach into a bag and pull out a name merit .,education
this is merit street medium .,education
a and i think this country is built on hard work and talent and added value .,education
and i know that about you .,education
ive known that about you for year and year and year .,education
and it is not about being a victim .,education
it is about second it up and doing what you got to do to get ahead .,education
and that defines you .,education
you and ive talked about it a hundred time .,education
and i know what father you are .,education
i know what family man you are .,education
i know ive seen you in march .,education
we vacation together .,education
weve had serious conversation .,education
weve problem off together .,education
weve fought them off at the gate together .,education
i thought this is somebody that we have shared life experience and shared value .,education
and i said man this is somebody that ill go into fox hole with .,education
and thats why i picked up a phone call to you .,education
and man i appreciate man you talk about how thing have gone in this country and everything .,education
the symbol for this country is an eagle ? .,education
all the foreign eagle and fly proper .,education
you got to have a wing and a left wing .,education
i do not go all the way with what nobody say .,education
i am not the far guy .,education
and i show it to fall left guy .,education
because i to get it man where i care about my family .,education
i care about my grandchild .,education
i care about my kid man .,education
and i am trying to figure out the world that they are going to be in .,education
and if we keep going at the pace we are going .,education
got to taste something my son linder wa crazy to me .,education
because we have the issue now .,education
we got all this pro now picking .,education
thats cool .,education
but this wa a guy i saw this online that made me a laugh but it threw me .,education
had a little boy in front of this table and they put two oreo cooky in front of me and put five hundred on the other side and told u little boy to pick .,education
all the boy looking at them cooky and looking at five hundred and let me tell you something .,education
he wa good at it because he did not cook it .,education
and that five hundred .,education
they doubled down and they put four oreo cooky in front of me one thousand .,education
i saw this little boy .,education
he had made up his mind .,education
the ripping wa over .,education
it is a done deal .,education
he picked them for cooky .,education
he wa through .,education
he wa solved it for me .,education
the money on the cooky .,education
and then a lady came up and said and this is why kid do not need to be picking a sex at school .,education
and i laughed but that hit me a hammer man .,education
i am gon na say what are we going with all this ?,education
hold up man .,education
we got slow down a little bit .,education
because this little boy clearly took them for cooky .,education
he a thousand .,education
it is a thousand wa here .,education
you do not know the thousand .,education
you could have bought how many pack of cooky .,education
you could have got a bike .,education
boy you could have got your sister new school .,education
you could have bought the girl down and straight some cooky .,education
you could have bought the girl and scout box of cooky .,education
how many girl you had after that ?,education
that boy picked them for cooky .,education
and i said man thats what we got to start thinking about .,education
and man i am with everybody making whatever decision they want to make .,education
but you got to be when somebody ha a counter now .,education
you got to be with a counter too .,education
if youve free to think and feel thats fine and then .,education
but you got to be open to the counter now .,education
because you can not publicly think and feel one way and expect publicly not to be thought of another way .,education
and i look at stuff that man .,education
and i think it is a fair to be able to talk about stuff that and say it out loud without you say without cancellation .,education
because i am trying to cancel nobody .,education
you and a dope person man .,education
do you but we got to take a shot look at where we let in our kid go .,education
i couldnt agree more .,education
and i think that we are in a real bad spot when we can not ask question without getting labeled a a hater or some foe .,education
we are in a real bad spot when we have people afraid to speak there .,education
mind or ask question or disagree for fear that they are going to get canceled .,education
and i always thought about college is somewhere you went to hear other idea .,education
or you went to the town square back in the old day where you had different point of you and you went to hear what they were .,education
now thats not the case .,education
if somebody disagrees they get shouted down .,education
they call it the hechlers veto .,education
they are going to shut you down where they do not hear the other side .,education
and what i want to do at merit street is i want u to own the debate lane .,education
look this is where you can come to talk about both side of an issue and then let people make up their own mind .,education
thats what i want our news department to do .,education
you turn on one cable news and you hear everything on the wing .,education
you are on the other hand you hear everything .,education
and left wing .,education
here a novel approach .,education
let tell people what happened and shut up .,education
tell them what happened and then shut up .,education
let them make up their mind about whether it is good news or bad news .,education
it is an insult to people .,education
we do not need to tell people what to think .,education
we need to tell people how to think .,education
we do not teach kid how to think anymore .,education
we do not teach critical thinking .,education
let teach kid how to think .,education
instead of what to think .,education
let them decide what they think .,education
let teach them how to do critical thinking .,education
let them decide what to do .,education
they do not need to be told what to think .,education
thats whats happening in college now .,education
we are teaching kid what to think instead of how to think .,education
we need to teach them how to go through the thought process .,education
thats whats important .,education
i want to be able to look man .,education
if you have a different subappinion from me i am fine with that .,education
i am cool with that man .,education
you do not have to think me .,education
i aint got to think you either .,education
and hold on man .,education
i am going to allow you to say what you want to say .,education
but can i not be allowed to say what i want to say ?,education
now what i want to say is not lined up with you .,education
why i got to bite the bullet ?,education
why you got to cancel my show ?,education
because it did not line up with what you said .,education
thats the trouble that we have in now man .,education
and it seems that cancellation thing is winning now .,education
yeah but i think you are starting to be a swing back .,education
and i certainly hope thats the case .,education
must go to do another commercial here .,education
this is live .,education
i got to do another commercial across this great country .,education
from coast to coast youve told me about the crossroad we are facing .,education
what steve wa talking about .,education
thats exactly why i wrote .,education
how you can stand strong for america soul insanity .,education
now this book is not a conversation starter .,education
it is a road map for standing strong in the face of adversity .,education
for embracing our core value when they are needed most .,education
now we are talking about real strategy for real people dealing with real issue .,education
and i am talking about from navigating the complexity of today polarized world to fortifying our family .,education
and i think that family in america are under attack now .,education
weve got to focus on strengthening our family .,education
and i set forth in the book ten principle that i think are critical for a healthy society .,education
this is not about politics .,education
do not want to be a politician .,education
do not know enough about politics to talk about it .,education
i think most people that talk about politics do not know enough about politics to talk about it .,education
i am willing to admit it .,education
i do not know enough about it .,education
but i talk about cultural issue because i do know about that .,education
and i think that if people want to have a conversation about that this is a place for them to go .,education
and we are going to be you and i are going to be doing a lot of thing that i think impact the family .,education
weve got one great project coming up that i love .,education
we are going to be doing a thing that youve been at for a long time .,education
we are going to put it on television and hopefully inspire people because you work with young men that do not have father in their world .,education
they do not have father in their life .,education
and we are going to do .,education
we are going to shoot a retreat about that .,education
we are going to do that in georgia .,education
yeah you are going to do that at my ranch down in georgia .,education
it is going to be a great man because it this is what i need .,education
because i need people to understand the severity .,education
we talk about it is one thing to discus a problem .,education
it is a whole other thing provide a solution for it ?,education
if you work for me and you come to me and you go mr. harvey we have an problem here .,education
if you do not have to fix for it please do not bring me the problem .,education
please do not do that to me .,education
because i got enough .,education
i got stuff stacked up to here .,education
if i want to hear whats going wrong i do not need you to come in here unless you have a fix .,education
we have a problem with our young men today .,education
my my foundation ha worked with young girl marjorie doe the girl and i do the boy .,education
and this is my 14th or 15th year doing this .,education
and we ive done over three thousand young men at the ranch personally .,education
ive done three million virtually every since covid .,education
three million young men .,education
ive done three thousand life that i bring to my ranch .,education
and what i do is i bring young men to my ranch who do not have active father in their life .,education
they are from single parent home headed up by woman because i know the daunting task that woman have in raising a young boy .,education
because how do you get this woman to possibly turn this boy into a man ?,education
thats got to be tough when youve never been one .,education
i offer my assistance .,education
and i get thousand and thousand of request every year .,education
this year will have three hundred boy .,education
our tv network is coming down there this year .,education
itll be the week leading up to father day weekend .,education

i am trying to say these young boy life .,education
i am trying to turn boy .,education
i am trying to turn these boy into better men .,education
and if i can teach them the principle of manhood to get them to understand who it .,education
that manhood is not a video in any chain .,education
it aint to size the old room .,education
it aint some girl in the background shaking .,education
that aint got nothing to do with manhood .,education
real men go to work .,education
real men obey the law .,education
real men respect woman .,education
real men go to work every day .,education

ive turned out young men who are engineer .,education
ive got minister from this program .,education
ive got young men who are in medical school .,education
ive got many college student .,education
ive got the track record to show you that if you put a dream in front of these young boy and teach them how to dream .,education

thats the problem we have .,education
see we keep beating these boy over the head .,education
come on go to school go to school .,education
let talk about the dream .,education
i had a young boy four year ago came to the camp and told me he will not defy our plane .,education

i got him to go down and get on the airplane with some pilot .,education
and they talked to him where he found out .,education
i got to do better in school because i am not need to be good at science and math .,education
because i put the dream in front of him .,education
i had two boy that wa gang banger .,education
and these cat wa at it man .,education

out of the three thousand ive only lost one .,education
who wouldnt stay at the camp .,education
and when you come down there there some of field .,education
and you bring these camera .,education

because i heard that before .,education
and thats what we get .,education
and how long do they stay ?,education
they stay about four day for that .,education
and they are all i need to ingrain them .,education
see it is real easy man .,education
because to get to a boy i know the way .,education
first of all i want to know what you are dreaming about .,education
and then i want to know what type of girl you want .,education
see once i find that out .,education
and then i start telling you what this girl going on .,education
and then thats going to tell you what you are going to need to do .,education
i have they undivided attention .,education
because i know what it is done .,education
it is real simple .,education
you got to get down the basic .,education
you talked about all the time .,education
you talked about common sense tv .,education
see yall good they going about this and wrong way .,education
man if school would implement a dream building course they could save they self a lot of trouble .,education
if you could ask the kid what do you dream about ?,education
you got to stop and talk to your kid every four month about what they dream about .,education
if you talk to them about what they dream about what they want in life you have their attention .,education
but you can not keep beating them over the head .,education
but you got to go to school .,education
it wa i do not have a lesson .,education
now what are you talking about ?,education
we can not even eat now .,education
these light resolved .,education
thats what they deal with dealing with some real situation .,education
and then you get out here in this world and you got instagram and tiktok showing the flash and presans a life without showing whats happening .,education
and these kid try to find a shortcut to that to that meal ticker .,education
and then they will not .,education
ill talk to many of these gang banger .,education
now ive talked to some that have been up in the hierarchy of the gang and a few that have gotten out .,education
and they tell me straight up that when they hear me say the number one need in all people is acceptance that thats what the gang use to turn these kid head .,education
they do not have father in the home .,education
they do not feel a sense of belonging .,education
and thats what the gang sell .,education
they say hey listen we got your back .,education
we love you .,education
you belong here .,education
and here this big authority figure thats real powerful to them .,education
and they say hey we love you .,education
well protect you .,education
this is a family .,education
you belong here .,education
we accept you .,education
they say i am in .,education
and thats how they motivate them .,education
and if somebody will give them an alternative if somebody will say look whats your passion ?,education
let me help you go after that .,education
but a kid that doesnt have a dream doesnt have a passion doesnt have hope .,education
how do you ever expect to motivate that young man ?,education
youve got to have i say that to adult too .,education
if you do not have a passion in your life what a horrible existence .,education
if there nothing you are passionate about in your life can you imagine ?,education
i would that be to get up every day .,education
and it be going through the motion gray .,education
every day the same is the last .,education
nothing you are excited about .,education
nothing you are passionate about .,education
what a terrible way to live .,education
it is .,education
and my one of the thing that helped me is see i bring back kid who have graduated from the program to help me with these kid that sleep in the barrack with them .,education
when i am not with them they go on hey man listen to me .,education
what this man saying is this is how you get out .,education
i bring ex gang banger down to talk to the boy .,education
but i tell you man i had to police in that one time .,education
i had to police talking to the boy .,education
they wa they wa they were because they some they they some tough kid .,education
and i wanted the question to the police officer .,education
we here to serve and protect .,education
and a handful of boy kept raising their hand .,education
why yall keep killing u do not they ?,education
why yall kill u . and thats a conversation that had to be had .,education
and all police do not do that .,education
you have the news this is what we are doing .,education
this is what we see .,education
and this is what we saw before .,education
that wa phone camera and stuff that out there too .,education
it is a real conversation that we have in dealing with real life man with some real solution to it .,education
and you coming there to some of them and going to be a big shot in the arm .,education
i believe that man .,education
i can not wait to do it .,education
and i am excited to do it .,education
i am excited to meet these young men .,education
i am excited to turn the camera on and let people see the amazing work that you are doing and get people to step up and support it .,education
thats what we want .,education
we want people to make it where you can not work with three hundred boy but you can work with three thousand boy .,education
thats what you want to do .,education
that you can have the facility and do what it what you want to do to show them that there something else in life besides what they come from .,education
because some of them come where hope is it is a word .,education
bro you do not want to highlight .,education
it wa last year for me .,education
wanted to guy it came back .,education
he a minister .,education
he came back .,education
and he wa having prayer out in the lodge with about fifty at a boy .,education
and i do not know what wa going on out there .,education
and he had him in the circle praying .,education
and i am looking at the kid .,education
and i did not recognize him .,education
but i wouldnt pay any attention because it is many kid come through the camp .,education
sometimes they drive down .,education
it is hard .,education
i wa here four year ago .,education
i know it is camp time .,education
and for this dude to be doing that and then helping these cat out man it is such a moving thing .,education
and the program work man .,education
and how it is .,education
hard to ask for money when you rich .,education
youve tried that .,education
youve tried to ask for some money in you rich man .,education
thats a funky conversation .,education
because first of all everybody when you talk and the whole room is doing this here because they think you got it .,education
why do not you give it some more ?,education
nobody want to factor in the effort .,education
i have one hundred employee .,education
and i have pay for the ranch .,education
and i have pay for this food and all this here .,education
and then i got a company to run .,education
and i got some employee .,education
it is waiting on the check .,education
and they think it is a bottomless pit of money .,education
it is hard .,education
and then i am not that i am not that guy either .,education
it is hard for me to because of my pride level .,education
because ive been pulling myself up by the bootstrap a long time .,education
it is that i do not ran up into .,education
i know three hundred boy that need boot now .,education
and people either help or they will not .,education
and if they think it is not the thing to do it is not the thing to do .,education
but well ask anyway because the boy deserve it .,education
and you can not do it for everybody .,education
and then you got to get some help .,education
and well ask for some help .,education
i am never thought i could do everything by myself .,education
you can not do everything by yourself .,education
but those people that want to help will help .,education
and those that do not will not .,education
but i think when they see whats happening here they are going to be part of that .,education
maybe they give their time maybe they give their money whatever .,education
but we are going to give them a chance to see whats going on .,education
thats good work .,education
the thing i love about this conversation is people love you .,education
they love your persona .,education
they love your comedy .,education
they love the way you deal with people .,education
and that you always interact with them and never in a mean spirit .,education
and why even if you are cutting up with them joe can make him fun or whatever .,education
you are always fast to make sure you are the butt of the joke .,education
instead of it somebody else ha experienced .,education
but i love for people to get to see another side of you .,education
and know what you are all about .,education
and the depth and caring that you have and how deep steve harvey run .,education
and i am glad for people to get to see that .,education
and i am glad to get a chance to pull the curtain back and let them see who you are .,education

the message in our society is wrong .,education
you are not stuck with the brain you have .,education
you can make it better and i can prove it .,education
meet dr. daniel aiman the celebrity psychiatrist the brain health expert and a twelvetime new york time bestselling author .,education
if i am and i am me braimen being need to love your brain .,education
mission is to end mental illness by creating a revolution in brain health .,education
today we discus all thing brain health dementia alzheimers and adhd .,education
and to bunk the few month along the way .,education
come on we need to get into the 21st century .,education
psychiatrist are the only medical doctor who virtually never look at the organ they treat .,education
think about that .,education
if you want to keep your brain healthy or rescuer you have to prevent or treat .,education
the eleven major risk factor that steal your mind .,education
today episode is brought to you by the awesome organization that make this show possible .,education
dr. aiman is a pleasure to meet you .,education
thank you for making your way on a very rainy day here in los angeles to spend time with me .,education
i am looking forward to discussing all thing brain health optimizing brain health focus memory cognition preventing thing cognitive decline dementia alzheimers .,education
i am interested in the mutability of the brain and brain health .,education
and we are going to talk about your new book also .,education
of course raising mentally strong kid .,education
i am a parent of four kid .,education
this is very interesting to me .,education
but i think the two primary motivating thing that made me most excited about sitting down with you today is first a little over a year ago .,education
i wa diagnosed with adhd which came a quite a surprise .,education
many question for you about this .,education
it wa not something that i thought would be something i would be associated with .,education
the second is that my mother is currently in the throe of dementia .,education
obviously a quite devastating situation a all too .,education
and i want to learn a much a i can about how to help her how to help my dad a you also might imagine is in a very challenging situation .,education
and of course to do everything i can to avoid a similar peril for myself .,education
and a much a that might sound i am trying to make this about me i am not .,education
maybe a little bit with the adhd part but when you consider the statistic on dementia and alzheimers it is about all of u is not it ?,education
i looked up some statistic about an hour ago .,education
and it is quite devastating the extent to which these disease of dementia are taking over and growing at alarming rate .,education
in two thousand and twenty three six.seven million american over sixty five have alzheimers one in nine fifty five million around the globe .,education
two third of these people are woman which is fascinating .,education
and it is very much on the rise .,education
i saw some statistic by two thousand and sixty the cdc predicts a sevenfold increase .,education
and globally from fifty five million to one hundred and thirty nine million by two thousand and fifty .,education
this is a problem that is going to leave very few people untouched .,education
if you are blessed to live eighty five you have a one in two chance .,education
a beam diagnosed with dementia .,education
one in two one in two which mean it is either you or your partner .,education
and thats horrifying .,education
but what most people do not know is you can have an impact on that .,education
and it is two thousand and five a road of book with my friend rod chankel called preventing alzheimers .,education
and i updated it in two thousand and seventeen with memory rescue .,education
and the big idea is if you want to keep your brain healthy or rescue it you have to prevent or treat the eleven major risk factor that steal your mind .,education
and you talked about your mom having it .,education
the namanic that well talk about is called bright mind .,education
and the g in bright mind is genetics .,education
but we do not think about it properly .,education
overweight because my family overweight or i have hypertension because it run in my family or i have diabetes because it run in my family or i have alzheimers disease or i am vulnerable to it and there nothing i can do about it .,education
and thats a lie .,education
jean increase your vulnerability .,education
and they teach you what you should be doing .,education
for example i have six child three of them are adopted .,education
we adopted because their parent couldnt stop with drug in alcohol .,education
and it wa a disaster for these kid .,education
and i tell my niece if you never drank or do drug you are never going to have a problem .,education
but if you do it could be serious .,education
you need to be on an alcohol drug prevention program every day of your life .,education
i have obesity and heart disease in my family .,education
i am going to be seventy this year .,education
i do not have heart disease because i am on an obesity heart disease prevention program every day of my life .,education
if you have it in your family a soon a you should be serious about preventing these eleven major risk factor .,education
i want to get into all those strategy .,education
but let talk a little bit about whats driving this .,education
what is causing this ?,education
i would imagine a portion of the spike that we are seeing this increase in incident is related to the fact that people are living long and baby boomer are aging up .,education
but also i suspect that lifestyle habit are contributing to this a with the increase in type two diabetes obesity hypertension and the .,education
whats causing cognitive decline ?,education
are unhealthy lifestyle and undisciplined mind ?,education
did depression double the risk of alzheimers and woman and quadruple it in man ?,education
what is the relationship between depression and dementia ?,education
many people think if you are an older person and you get depressed it is a precursor to dementia .,education
they are both brain disease or brain problem if you will .,education
and it is critical in the m in bright mind mental health stuff .,education
i have excited about this because what i came to realize i started looking at the brain in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one and weve looked it over two hundred and fiftyzero scan .,education
but early on i came to realize you are not stuck with the brain you have .,education
you can make it better and i can prove it .,education
and if i look at your brain and then you have a car accident your brain is going to be worse .,education
if i look at your brain and then you go on a drug bender your brain is going to be worse .,education
if i look at your brain and then you all have a sudden you stop sleeping or you go through divorce odds are your brain going to change in a negative way .,education
but i also did the big nfl study .,education
when the nfl wa lying they had a problem with traumatic brain injury and football .,education
eighty of my player got better .,education
i could see the damage but when they go on a brain healthy program eighty that brain looked better anywhere from two to six month later .,education
thats exciting .,education
i wa a consultant on the movie concussion .,education
and i wa bummed because the movie a downer .,education
is it the will smith one ?,education
the will smith one .,education
remember that ?,education
and it is wheres the hope ?,education
and the message on football dementia or cte chronic traumatic and selflawfully the message in our society is wrong .,education
it is you have this .,education
it is chronic progressive untreatable .,education
and player do not come and get help because they feel hopeless .,education
it is get help early probably while you are still playing .,education
that you can begin to reverse the damage .,education
it is the big exciting lesson over the last thirty year in neuroscience neuroplasticity .,education
you are not stuck with the brain .,education
you have you can make it better .,education
there an area of the brain called the hippocampus .,education
collect seahorse .,education
it is great for seahors .,education
it is shaped seahors .,education
every day you are making seven hundred new stem cell in the hippocampus .,education
or i think of them a baby seahorse .,education
your behavior is going to grow them .,education
or it is going to shrink them .,education
and if you are vulnerable to dementia thats the area that get hit early in dementia .,education
and you want to love those seahorse nourish them feed them teach them rather than get them drunk or stoned or shrubble them .,education
your main protocol in evaluating people brain is this imaging technology called spectre .,education
can you describe what that is ?,education
can i tell the prestory to put it in context ?,education
when i wa eighteen vietnam wa still going on .,education
and the government had a draft .,education
and i became an infantry medic where my love of medicine wa born .,education
but about a year into it i did not being shot at .,education
it is not for me .,education
it is for some people .,education
it is not for me .,education
i got retrained a an xray technician and developed a passion for medical imaging .,education
a our professor used to say how do unless you look ?,education
and then one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine i am a second year medical student .,education
i get married and two month later my wife tried to kill herself horrified .,education
and i take her to see a wonderful psychiatrist and i come to realize if he help her it will not help her .,education
itll help me .,education
itll help our child our grandchild a they would be shaped by someone who happier and more stable .,education
forty five year ago i fell in love with psychiatry and ive loved it every day since .,education
but i fell in love with the only medical specially that never look at the organ it treat .,education
and i knew it wa wrong and i knew it would change .,education
i had no idea itd be part of it .,education
one thousand nine hundred and ninety one i am now a psychiatrist for about a decade .,education
and i went to a lecture at my local hospital on brain spectrum imaging .,education
itll photon emission computed to my birthday .,education
it is a nuclear medicine study that look at blood flow and activity .,education
it look at how your brain work .,education
and it show u three thing .,education
healthy activity to little activity or too much .,education
how is it doing that ?,education
what is the process by which thats revealing itself ?,education
again it is a nuclear medicine study .,education
what we do is we take a radio pharmaceutical .,education
we take one we use is called technician .,education
and technician ha selfesteem problem .,education
it doesnt being who it is .,education
and it change shape .,education
and when it change shape it produce a photon or a little packet of light that we can measure .,education
we combine technician with hmpa a medicine thats easily taken up by cell in the brain .,education
combine them and inject them into your arm .,education
and it is called a firstpass extraction .,education
seventy of it is taken up in your brain in that first pas or with it about two minute .,education
and then it is part of the procedure .,education
a little tiny needle into a vein in your arm .,education
and inject the medicine .,education
it light up your brain .,education
and then we can measure it .,education
have you lay on a camera table ? ?,education
it is not claustrophobic .,education
people lay on the camera .,education
the camera head come around your head about fifteen minute .,education
and we get about ten million count or ten million time that little piece of light hit the crystal in the camera .,education
and then we reconstruct it .,education
it look a brain .,education
and we then conceive in your brain which area are most active which area are healthy which area are sleepy compare it to our massive database .,education
and my eightyearold grandson can look at a scan and go healthy or not .,education
and it is helpful to look .,education
and off camera we talked about controversy .,education
i start looking at the brain .,education
and we never make a diagnosis from a scan .,education
thats important .,education
we make a diagnosis all doctor with all of the information .,education
take detailed history .,education
if you came to c youd feel out of about an hour worth .,education
the paperwork doctor or a story end for a couple of hour .,education
we get to know you .,education
and then we would test your brain .,education
we do a computerized neuropsych assessment .,education
and we would scan your brain .,education
and when you put that puzzle together it is powerful .,education
the first patient i ever scanned .,education
i went from the lecture on brain spectrum imaging given by the head of the hospital where i worked into sandys room .,education
she tried to kill herself the night before .,education
and a i wa talking to her i am thinking she ha adult add .,education
impulsive suicide attempt after a fight with her husband the she caused .,education
iq of one hundred and forty four but never finished college when i go .,education
tell me how you studied .,education
i wa the one who wa the one i prefer the test .,education
i put on a pot of coffee .,education
say up all my duty test .,education
in my mind i am feeling pretty confident about this .,education
but when i broach the subject with her shes adult can not have add .,education
and i am thinking i am the doctor .,education
she wa resistant .,education
and i had been doing a study called quantitative eeg up to that point .,education
i knew i needed to do a twice once it rast .,education
once while she did a concentration task .,education
and then after i got the result a couple of day later i am in her hospital room .,education
she ha a table .,education
i put the scan on the table .,education
she had a healthy brain at rast .,education
and when she tried to concentrate her frontal lobe and her cerebellum which well talk about dropped of it is clear .,education
what doe that tell you ?,education
the harder she try the worse it get .,education
it is classic .,education
it is what i wa predicting i would see .,education
because thats what i saw in quantitative eeg .,education
and when i showed her the scan and explained them to her she start to cry .,education
and she said you mean this is not my fault .,education
and it is people who need glass .,education
they are not dumb and crazier stupid .,education
people wear glass .,education
i wear glass to drive .,education
our eyeball are shape funny .,education
and we wear glass we can focus .,education
people have add .,education
they are frontal lobe and cerebellum often turn off when they should turn on .,education
medicine or supplement or other strategy well talk about you can focus .,education
i could see with the image that her shame melted away and her compliance went up .,education
and she took the medicine .,education
her relationship were better .,education
she ended up she wa underemployed a many add people are finished college .,education
and it wa in touch with her for about ten year .,education
this wa an inciting incident that allowed you to see the benefit of using this a a diagnostic tool this imaging technology .,education
i it when my patient get better .,education
i went into psychiatry and it wa personal for me .,education
and i loved it .,education
but i wa already getting criticism from it .,education
it is we do not do this .,education
it is not what we do .,education
but one thousand nine hundred and ninety two all day seminar at the american psychiatric association brand backdimaging in child cytree because i am also a child psychiatrist .,education
i am excited because i am meeting colleague who do it .,education
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three i teach with that group .,education
i am all in on the technology .,education
but it wa one thousand nine hundred and ninety three lot of pushback from the american psychiatric association .,education
because it doesnt fit the current diagnostic paradigm .,education
it is stop giving people the diagnosis of depression .,education
the person symptom cluster it shouldnt be a diagnosis .,education
chaspane is a symptom .,education
it is not a diagnosis .,education
if you have chaspane it doesnt tell you whats causing that .,education
and it doesnt tell you what to do for it. . it is in dishatolookdeeper and use other diagnostic tool to confirm whats happening .,education
but that wa twenty year ago is there a sense that the medical establishment ha changed it tune because if you look at your wikipedia page it is a diatribe on the lack of scientific efficacy with respect to this imaging tuck .,education
yeah i do not know what to do about wikipedia .,education
two thousand and sixteen january published eighty study .,education
people always never publishes work .,education
it is doderead .,education
discover magazine listed our research a one of the top one hundred story in science for two thousand and fifteen .,education
thats pretty excited about that .,education
two thousand and twenty one the canadian association of nuclear medicine wrote procedure guideline on spact a if i wrote them .,education
and five of the ten author had been my student at some point .,education
ftenzero medical and mental health professional referred to our eleven clinic .,education
and two hundred and fiftyzero scan that you reviewed .,education
thats a people from one hundred and fifty five .,education
it is a massive dataset .,education
what are some of the general trend that ?,education
what can you extract from that giant dataset that speaks to brain health the mutability of brain health and the type of condition that most consistently in the patient that end up in your clinic ?,education
can i say with the controversy a little bit longer because it irritates me ?,education
the people who criticize me say he only due it for money .,education
you can not see these thing in the scan even though they are not expert .,education
but let see alternative .,education
psychiatrist are the only medical doctor who virtually never look at the organ they treat .,education
think about that .,education
and obviously if you have a brain dysfunction thats going to dictate a mental health outcome .,education
if we agree that your brain control everything you do ?,education
how you think how you feel how you act how you get along with other people .,education
and when it work you tend to work .,education
and when it is troubled you are more likely to have trouble in your life .,education
if you are brain the moment by moment function if you bring creates your mind then why wouldnt you ass the organ that you are working on ?,education
and a little more history in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three i start to get anxious because i have to big flaw .,education
and ive worked on them a lot but i people to me .,education
and you can not change a medical specialty if you are anxious about what people think of you .,education
i hate conflict .,education
you and i both .,education
i hate conflict .,education
and i people to me .,education
and all that changed in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five .,education
i spent from one thousand nine hundred and ninety three to one thousand nine hundred and ninety five anxious because i knew i had to do this ?,education
there not a choice .,education
once you look you can not unlock .,education
and one thousand nine hundred and ninety five i get a call late one night from my sister and ill share it who told me my nineyearold nephew andrew had attacked a little girl on the baseball field .,education
but no particular reason .,education
and i am what ?,education
and she said danny he different .,education
he mean .,education
he doesnt smile anymore .,education
i went into his room today and found two picture .,education
one of them he wa hanging from a tree .,education
the other picture he wa shooting other child .,education
if you think about it he columbine or sandy hawak or parkland florida waiting to happen .,education
and i am i want to see him tomorrow .,education
and they lived eight hour from me .,education
they brought him to me .,education
and he uncle tanny i am mad all the time .,education
is anybody teasing you ?,education
anybody touching you in place that shouldnt be touching you ?,education
nine hundred and ninety nine child catariss out of a thousand would put him on medicine and therapy .,education
and because of my experience i already scanned a thousand people at that point .,education
i am he got a lefthand prolow problem .,education
and i am i held his hand while he held his teddy bear and got scanned .,education
he wa missing the function of his lefthand prolow .,education
ive seen it a hundred time since then .,education
i learned how to get a cyst the size of a golf ball occupied in the space of his lefthand prolow .,education
and i told his pediatrician i said you find somebody to take it out because he wasnt in my neighborhood .,education
and he talked to three neurologist .,education
all of them said they wouldnt touch the cyst until he had real symptom .,education
at which point i lost my mind .,education
and i start screaming at the pediatrician of a homicide or suicidal child who attack people for no reason what do you mean real symptom ?,education
he got anxious and he said i think they mean seizure or he loses consciousness .,education
and in my head i am neurologist neurologist neurosurgeon neurosurgeon will do stuff .,education
i called ucla talked to the head of the pediatric neurosurgery department jorge lazar .,education
and he said doctor amen when these cyst are symptomatic .,education
we drain them .,education
he obviously symptomatic .,education
and after the surgery i got two call .,education
and for my sisterinlaw who said the surgery went and when andrew woke up he smiled at her .,education
she said danny he not smiled for a year .,education
and then i called from dr. lazar who said my god dr. m. and that cyst wa aggressive that put much pressure on andrew brain that thinned the bone over his left temporal lobe .,education
his skull had been thinned .,education
he said if we would have been head and head with the basketball would have killed him instantly either way would have been dead in six month .,education
thats an amazing story .,education
whats interesting is the idea that our personality are not static that something in this with the brain could completely change a person outlook on life how they show up in the world the thought that they are entertaining .,education
and within the case of that example a simple procedure not a simple procedure but a procedure could completely change that .,education
it can go the other way .,education
but after andrew and it is now thirty year later twenty nine year later andrew married ha two child ha his own business .,education
he normal .,education
and it wa that moment i lost my anxiety and my need for you to me .,education
thats when the war began to try to change psychiatry to become it is come on we need to get into the 21st century .,education
and one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine when i told my dad i wanted to be a psychiatrist .,education
he asked me why i did not want to be a real doctor .,education
yeah he wasnt happy about it .,education
why i wanted to be a nut doctor and hang out with nut all day long .,education
but that he wa reflecting what society belief that your weak if you have a mental health problem you are bad if you have a behavioral problem .,education
and the image clearly taught me free will is not zero or one hundred .,education
thats free will is gray .,education
and i ended up testifying in some duct penalty case .,education
if i am and i am that mean fortyzero psychiatrist and hundred of thousand only practice doctor obgyn internas that they are practicing witchcraft by making diagnosis based on symptom cluster with no biological data .,education
last year three hundred and thirty seven million prescription frantic depressant .,education
thats insane .,education
whats happening in our society is tragic .,education
and we need a different way .,education
in the mission i have in my life is crazy but the mission is to end mental illness .,education
creating a revolution in brain health which is why i am excited about brain .,education
it is a bold statement .,education
it is a great mission .,education
i think ancillary to what you shared is there a lot of misnomer when it come to mental health language is important in the word that we associate with some of the thing that people experience are perhaps not in the best interest of healing and welfare .,education
can you talk a little bit about that ?,education
the idea of talking about disease in general with respect to mental health .,education
of the three hundred and thirty seven million prescription written for antidepressant virtually no one wa talked to about their diet about their sleep habit about if they turn on the news first thing in the morning .,education
i love the idea of getting my patient excited about making their brain better rather than you a borderline personality disorder and you are probably not going to get better but here are the thing to do .,education
or you are bipolar you are going to need to take this medication for the rest of your life .,education
i am in justin biebers docuseries season and he came to me diagnosed with bipolar disorder on lithium .,education
i scanned him .,education

but can you imagine being twenty three and people saying you have a mental illness you are always going to have this mental illness .,education
you need to be on this medicine for the rest of your life .,education

every athlete i know is going to tell you that having the gear is key to performance .,education

in the case of somebody who suffered a cte some brain injury or in the case of someone justin bieber who being diagnosed with bipolar disorder .,education
not for nothing .,education
how about the fact that he young and famous and wealthy ?,education
how do you not have some dysfunction being young with a young brain trying to navigate that type of world ?,education
but i guess they almost killed that boy .,education
he wa pretty out of control for a while and he seems to be great now .,education
thats all i know .,education
i do not know him personally .,education
and if you read his mom book it is public knowledge .,education
he grew up with a lot of uncertainty and trauma and anxiety .,education
her parent did not want her to have justin and chanted up going in salvation .,education
army home from wet motherland .,education
there a lot .,education
there some childhood trauma stuff there .,education
childhood trauma .,education
and then you think early fame which is one of the worst thing for brain because you wear out your pleasure center .,education
in the brain all of that excitement and then unlimited money with very poor supervision in a brain that doesnt finish developing until twenty five .,education
see yeah it is a recipe for disaster dysfunction .,education
and one of my other patient i dearly love my least i wa god the grammy this year for a song .,education
make me emotional because the song about love .,education
and loving yourself .,education
but wa a shit show for a long time .,education
shes been on a journey .,education
shes been on a journey proud of her because shes in charge of her life rather than fame in charge or drug are in charge or other people are in charge .,education
i work hard with my patient for them to become good ceo of their life .,education
but you have to take care of the executive center in your life which is your prefrontal cortex largest in human and any other animal by far if you damage it with head trauma drug alcohol bad food not sleeping social medium .,education
it is not a good prescription .,education
what are some of the top line most important lifestyle protocol or intervention that you recommend when your patient come through and something lighting up or not lighting up in these scan and realize that there work that can be done to course correct .,education
it depends on your brain .,education
there are thing everybody should do .,education
love your brain and i horrified myself i do not know i guess about ten year ago when i went brain health is three thing .,education
got to care about it .,education
nobody care about their brain .,education
because you can not see it .,education
you can see the wrinkle in your scanner the fat around your belly and you can do something when you are unhappy with it .,education
i also think we are not taught to care for it .,education
it is not something that we think about .,education
we know we should eat better and all the and we know we can learn thing with our brain .,education
but there is not a broad sense that we can improve our brain health through certain lifestyle choice that we are making .,education
immediately your brain worse if you are drinking alcohol or if you are smoking pot .,education
immediately your brain worse if you do not prioritize sleep if you eat crappy food .,education
i am going back to these eleven major risk factor but it is three thing .,education
when i started one thousand nine hundred and ninety one i scanned everybody .,education
and i scanned my mom .,education
she wa sixty .,education
she had a beautiful brain which reflected her life .,education
she ha seven child fifty four grandchild great grandchild .,education
she know everybody .,education
still ninety two .,education
she know everybodys name .,education
she know whats going on in their life .,education
and shes someone that she brings people to her .,education
i scanned myself a week later .,education
and it wasnt nearly a good a my sixty year old mother .,education
and that irritated me .,education
but i played football in high school .,education
i had men in gydas twice a young soldier bad for the brain .,education
but i wasnt sleeping .,education
i thought i wa special .,education
i could get by on four hour of sleeping .,education
i am stupid because sleep is critical .,education
i am a double board certified psychiatrist .,education
top in our science student in medical school .,education
and i do not care about my own brain .,education
i saw it and i cared .,education
pymis and b not the cause .,education
you need to love your brain .,education
and thats where brain health start .,education
it is i have this organ .,education
the creates me .,education
and then a void thing that hurt it got another list and do thing that help it .,education
and again you have to know the lesson .,education
we do the bright mind .,education
it say what to avoid and what to do .,education
those eleven principle that are built into that yeah and they are everywhere .,education
and my head b for example for blood flow .,education
low blood flow is the number one brain imaging predictor of alzheimers disease .,education
if you have it in your family and i scan you we are going to look .,education
spacked is a study that look at blood flow and might a chondrel activity .,education
forty nine of the tracer take him up in the mitochondrion .,education
we are going to look at blood flow and energy .,education
and if it is low we are going to go why head trauma his drug alcohol caffeine nicotine nonsleeping having high blood pressure being overweight .,education
and we are going to target the reason why it is low .,education
and then we are going to do exercise increase blood flow .,education
ginko is one of my favorite supplement because the best plan ever see have taken ginko or regular cayenne pepper beat increase blood flow .,education
know your risk factor and then know what to do .,education
and the trick with exercise is coordination exercise .,education
people who play rocket sport live longer than everybody else .,education
this is a replicated study unlike ninetyzero people because what coordination doe is it activates your cerebellum little brain ten of the brain volume in the back half the brain neuron .,education
and if you activate that it turn on the rest of your brain .,education
i am a huge fan of table tennis and pickleball tennis .,education
it is bad news for me .,education
i am very athletic but when it come to anything involving ihand coordination i am terrible at it .,education
and ive avoided it my whole life .,education
but thats good news for you .,education
because there more to be gained ?,education
yeah get a good ping pong coach .,education
and do not judge yourself .,education
go and learn to be good .,education
and do not have to beat people .,education
if you spend a half an hour twice a week itll have a major impact on your ability to think .,education
because you got to get your eye hand and foot all working together .,education
you think about the spin on the ball .,education
i think that is a roebig chest .,education
i have this thing which i think might be fairly common which is this idea that perhaps i am past the point of no return .,education
i wa a competitive swimmer growing up .,education
between the age of fourteen and twenty one i wa training four to five hour a day waking up at four oclock thirty in the morning and walking around overtrain a zombie .,education
i always felt fatigue during that period of time .,education
alcohol became quite the thing around age eighteen and from eighteen to thirty one a progression into alcoholism .,education
and during that period of time maybe getting one good night of sleep .,education
the rest of the night were blackout or recovering from blackout .,education
i get sober at thirty one but from thirty one to forty i transfer a lot of that addictive energy into my lifestyle choice .,education
i wa sedentary and subsisting on hot dog french fry pizza mcdonalds jack in the box not exercising .,education
at around forty i have a come to jesus moment .,education
i changed my lifestyle habit and many thing about my life and i am a much healthier person now .,education
i am a playbased diet .,education
i am very fit and active .,education
i am engaged mentally through the process of doing this podcast and other thing that i do .,education
and my life is good but i can not shake this sense that i have done much damage over the course of my lifetime .,education
that no matter how many good thing i do now that at some point i am not going to be able to overcome that damage .,education
it is going to catch up to me .,education
and whats the point in doubling down and investing in all of the thing that you are saying ?,education
and i think on some level that might be common people are thinking ive treated myself terribly .,education
that song ha been sung .,education
it is a lot .,education
mutability is your whole thing .,education
we can not but is there a period at which i would suspect it is more difficult than it is for others .,education
but what would you tell someone myself or someone who of a similar mindset or a similar type past history ?,education
one we should look ?,education
and many people go no i do not want to know .,education
yeah i am scared .,education
if you a little scared if you knew a train wa going to hit you wouldnt you at least try to get out of the way a long a there wa a possibility to get out of the way ?,education
of course .,education
if i couldnt get out of the way let it hit me and i am not the wiser .,education
i want you to be on it .,education
scan my brain on youtube and instagram .,education
and one of my favorite guy troy glaus two thousand and two world series mvp played third base for the angel .,education
love him daryl drinking way too much for concussion to press suicidal .,education
he wa in a dark place did not think there wa any hope .,education
and i got him to do my show .,education
i do not know how bad happened .,education
but he did what i asked him to do .,education
and his wife anne who i dearly love she wa a good partner .,education
he stopped drinking ate better exercised took the supplement lost fifteen pound in two month .,education
and i am let look again because i could tell he wa better .,education
it is brain significantly better .,education
in a two month period .,education
two month .,education
and then i scanned him sixteen month late .,education
how old is he ?,education
forty seven ?,education
now and there were ups and down ?,education
when you are an alcoholic doe you do not stop ?,education
some people do but there wa some bump for u . but we are in the fight together .,education
and sixteen month later his brain is good .,education
and i know five year from now if he continues on and he ha brain envy .,education
his brain going to be freaking normal .,education
you have a choice .,education
but if you do not know if you do not look you do not know .,education
and why would you ever be in that position ?,education
i want to know which is why every couple of year ill get a whole body scan because if trouble coming i want to get it early .,education
i do not want to wait until late .,education
many of the lifestyle illness that we are seeing now are track to chronic inflammation .,education
what are some of the thing that we can do to ameliorate that that have implication in term of brain health ?,education
in bright mind the first diet is inflammation .,education
and some surprising thing is ninety eight of u have low level of omegathree fatty acid .,education
if you are not taking an omegathree supplement or focused on eating lowmirkory high omegathree fish thats a problem because lowmagatree increase inflammation .,education
if you are not a bit obsessed with your gum and your teeth youve more likely to have brain disease and heart disease .,education
and i did not tell you down on that a little bit it is always amazing to me that that doesnt get enough bandwidth in term of our overall health .,education
because i now have had parodontal disease and gum problem my whole life .,education
and i wa educated early about the implication of not treating that because that tends to lead to arthrochlorotic issue and brain health obviously it is a circulatory situation .,education
it ha to have implication in term of brain health .,education
because your brain is two of your body weight but us twenty of the blood flow in your body .,education
twenty of the oxygen in your body go to your brain .,education
and if you have gum disease infection in your gum parodontal issue abscess and the how doe that translate into circulatory issue ?,education
what do you have a higher risk of alzheimers disease ?,education
it increase inflammation which many people think is the mother of all illness .,education
i do not know about that but i do not want to have inflammation .,education
and for a long time i did not care about my own gum until study after study gum disease heart disease gum disease brain disease .,education
no got ta take care of them .,education
become a flossing fool .,education
in term of blood work what should people be paying attention to ?,education
you mentioned omega 3 but if someone doing a blood panel and they get the result what are some thing that would jump out to you ?,education
if we look at some of the important number for bright mind blood pressure would be for blood flow retirement and aging you do not want high iron level .,education
iron accelerates aging .,education
do you do not want low iron because ill make you not sleep and be anxious .,education
and i tend to accumulate iron i go donate blood twice a year and that seems to help .,education
good for other people good for me .,education
for inflammation you want to know your c reactive protein for genetics .,education
you probably should know your apoe for gene type .,education
i am a two three .,education
is that the gene thats connected to that increase the crisshampsworth situation ?,education
he a double or a lealer whatever ?,education
yeah yeah he a e44 which mean he ha a ten fold risk .,education
but a ten fold risk mean about twenty five .,education
and it mean be serious and exercise the exercise you are doing decrease the risk if you have one or two e4 gene .,education
for head trauma system number of head trauma you have toxin hows your liver function ?,education
liver function test mental health that your ace score adverse childhood experience .,education
how many do you have ?,education
my wife wrote a book called the rolentons courage of scared child .,education
shes an eight .,education
not of ten .,education
my niece is who i adopted her both nine .,education
if you have four or more it increase your risk of seven of the top ten leading cause of death .,education
if you have six or more you die twenty year now .,education
my niece is in my wife are not dying twenty year early because there are thing you can do to extract the past trauma which is super important .,education
the second eye is immunity and infection .,education
know you are vitamin d level and get it above forty people who are above forty have half the risk of cancer of those who are under twenty .,education
when i first tested mine when i figured this out twenty year ago i wa seventeen .,education
because i exercise but i exercise at night because i am working during the day and i realize i need more sun and i need to supplement to have a healthy level not too much but a healthy level .,education
and then and is neuroharmones get them tested every year .,education
we are living in a society where low testosterone level are rampant in young male and ive never seen anything quite it .,education
what is contributing to that ?,education
head trauma and toxin .,education
are more young male having head trauma than they used to be ?,education
with football and soccer and skateboarding maybe the other thing is toxin on their body .,education
the product you put on their body .,education
i have all my patient download the up thing dirty and scan all of your personal product to see the healthy g thing it .,education
it is similar to it .,education
for example it is to shave with barbersaw fifty year and on a scale of zero a lowlong ten is kill you early .,education
it is a nine and now i shape with something called kiss my face which is a two .,education
it is insane the extent to which there are many chemical in our everyday product that were unaware of and the lack of regulation on this .,education
ive had plenty of guest in the past come on to talk about i can cut from uwg .,education
my friend darren oleen wrote a book called fatal convenience and you read it .,education
it is very solution oriented but it is quite an eyeopener to realize the amount of toxicity in our personal care product and thing that we take for granted and assume our safe .,education
and what happened during covid ?,education
it is all of a sudden these toxic hand sanitizers that have parabens and dalades and fragrance that are bad for you .,education
people are lathering themselves they are child with this stuff which is why i am a fan of earth friendly product because they make these claiming product that i know interest in them except i love them .,education
i am now being sick is expensive .,education
this is about love .,education
why would you put something on your body or your child body that is pleasing ?,education
get your hormone checked and then your hemoglobin a1c obviously and your bmi .,education
they are very important number to know seventy two of american are overweight forty two are obese .,education
it is the biggest brain drain in the history of the world .,education
then i did an nfl study healthy weight nfl player versus overweight nfl player love frontal lobe function and i am no and can you talk about it without somebody being mad at you ive had lot of people mad at me but it is science ?,education
i am making the connection if you are overweight of these eleven risk factor you have seven of them because it decrease blood flow promotes aging increase inflammation change healthy testosterone into unhealthy cancer promoting form of estrogen and you got ta get serious .,education
now being underweights bad for your brain being overweight bad for your brain .,education
if you do not love yourself it is pretty hard to invest in get that person to invest in healthier lifestyle habit .,education
there is a mental health thing a much a it is a rational logical information thing .,education
and there are many people who had or childhood trauma for example who developed real rage about what happened but then guilt about the rage because i still have to be with these people .,education
they still house me and feed me .,education
and it go unconscious .,education
they started attacking themselves .,education
it is hard for me if i believe it my core i am bad to do the thing out of love because you do not love yourself .,education
and that is a brain problem because trauma get stuck in your brain but it is also psychological problem .,education
i think of all my patient and four big circle .,education
it is the biology which is brain health .,education
why we got to look at your brain and those important number we talked about .,education
how is your psychological health ?,education
it is your mind whats the quality of your thought the level of the trauma you have whats the chatter in your head .,education
there also a social circle .,education
whats going on in your life now with your kid with your spouse with work .,education
and there a spiritual circle .,education
what is your deepest sense of meaning and purpose ?,education
and in my mind when i evaluate my patient all four circle all the time i want to have an exercise called the one page miracle .,education
relationship work money physical emotional spiritual .,education
what do you want ?,education
you can look at it on a regular basis .,education
are you noticing what you about the other people in your life more than what you do not ?,education
and whenever you feel sad mad nervous or out of control down with your thinking .,education
and i have this great process thinking in honest accurate way .,education
i am not a huge fan of positive thinking .,education
i am a fan of accurate thinking with a positive spin .,education
thatd be worth chatting about .,education
and i am going to get your brain healthy .,education
if i give you these strategy and you do not do it i want to bond with you you come back and trust me .,education
and then i want to work on perhaps the past trauma .,education
i love a therapy called bmdr specific psychological treatment for trauma stand for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing .,education
and i love another one called istdp intensive short term dynamic therapy .,education
and the foundation of that therapy is people struggling .,education
they will not do the thing that could do to be healthy .,education
it is attachment problem that led to rage and then guilt about the rage and selfattack .,education
it is they are living that i did something wrong .,education
even though everybodys done thing wrong .,education
and most people forgive themselves .,education
they are living with this selfattack .,education
and that take sometimes intense therapy but doesnt have to be long .,education
thats why they call it intensive short term dynamic psychotherapy .,education
and youve had success with that great success with that ?,education
yeah it is interesting .,education
because you can show that person is not a many scan a you want but until you want to tie that knot and get to the root of whats driving that disposition thats preventing them from making change it is not going to matter .,education
ive never seen anything a powerful a showing somebody there brain with addiction .,education
when i first started ordering scan a the director of a dualdiagnosis unit psychiatric hospital unit that take care of substance abuser their brain were bad .,education
and i wa here healthy brain here your brain .,education
your brain control everything you do which brain do you want ?,education
i think anybody with an addiction should get their brain scanned .,education
and i came up with a wrote a book with david smith called unchained your brain breaking the addiction that steal your life .,education
and giving everybody prosaxons saying there are many different way to get depressed .,education
give everybody a twelvestep program .,education
it is a bit insane because they are impulse of addict they are compulsive addict they are impulse of compulsive addict or sad addict or head trauma addict .,education
it is no the type you had .,education
and if somebody diagnosed you with add which we will talk about thats our impulsive addict group .,education
it is you want to do the thing but you do not have enough of a break to stop .,education
and that could go with low frontalow activity .,education
our compulsive addict they get the same thought in their head over and over again .,education
and sometimes clinically it is hard to tell the difference because they go i am impulsive but what they mean is their compulsive .,education
they get a thought the impulsive person get a thought and doe it without thinking .,education
the compulsive person get thought over and over again and ha to do it .,education
and one is a dopamine intervention .,education
the other is a serotonin intervention and how would unless you looked ?,education
hey everybody .,education
today episode is brought to you by seed .,education
good health .,education
i talk about it all the time on the podcast .,education
it is important if youve even listened to a few of my podcasts .,education
i think ive maybe devoted i do not know it doesnt .,education
two dozen episode to the micro biome .,education
you got to take care of your gut health if you want to have optimal health .,education

hit the link in the description below to visit c.com slash rich roll and use code rich roll twenty five .,education
a little over a year ago i did a week long intensive therapeutic process that wa intended to be traumaoriented childhood traumaoriented and it wa incredible .,education
and over the course of that week i spent time with a wide variety of psychiatrist .,education
and at the end of that week there wa a consensus among all of these psychiatrist that i had adhd .,education
a i said at the beginning that wa news to me because i had always thought of this a a condition associated with hyperactivity .,education
i wa not a hyperactive kid .,education
i did not feel i had any of the symptomology that at least in my mind wa associated with that condition .,education
but through the process of being diagnosed and working through it ive developed a whole new perspective on this .,education
and i realized the extent to which i developed coping strategy to deal with this that allowed me to overcome that predisposition .,education
i would have never known .,education
i did not think that i wa that person .,education
swim and ill treat it .,education
yeah thats how i did it .,education
i would exhaust myself through exercise and that i could calm down and sit .,education
i did not have that experience of not being able to focus because the exercise gave me a different baseline .,education
can i talk about the five homework symptom of add and you tell me which one you have ?,education
they are more the diagnostic criterion includes eighteen but i think of one thats short attention span but not for everything .,education
it is short attention span for regular routine every day .,education
thing school or homework paperwork chore for thing that are new novel highly stimulating or frightening people with add compared attention by because they have their own intrinsic dopamine .,education
love is a drug especially new love is a dopamine drug .,education
if you love your teacher we are going to want to please them .,education
and you do fine in that class .,education
but your attention span is erratic and thats what fool people because they are no but i am interested .,education
i heard president george w. bush say this and he said now i did in the class i wa interested in and i am not another add president we came off of bill clinton who clearly had impulse control issue .,education
doe that resonate with you ?,education
the thing that i am interested in i can be completely obsessed by .,education
and i have a huge capacity for persevering and determination .,education
and i could force myself to do the work that i wasnt interested in but it becomes very exhausting .,education
and i thought everybody wa suffering through this in the same way that i wa rather than the truth which wa i wa this round peg trying to jam myself into a square hole .,education
yeah that you did not love it .,education
and if you have add one of the thing i tell my add patient is find something you love that you can make money up. . too often find thing you love that you then depend on other people .,education
thats prescription for misery .,education
the second symptom is distraintability .,education
too much .,education
you feel too much you sense too much .,education
it is the world come at you quickly .,education
and you want to sit down and read a book but then you get distracted by the email or by your phone or because you are hungry or something .,education
but also is not that everybody ?,education
no my best friend in medical school had add .,education
and i loved him dearly graduated top of our class .,education
i wa second .,education
he wa first but he wa my partner .,education
i wa proud of him .,education
and distracted .,education
and it wa funny to watch him .,education
i do not feel i am a distracted person but i do feel i need to be doing one thing at a time .,education
and a long a i have this one thing that i am doing i am i can focus .,education
i can even when i do not feel doing it i can overcome that overwrite it and do it .,education
where i get into trouble is when i wake up and now my life is very full there lot of thing happening .,education
and i start to think about all the thing that i have to do .,education
and it becomes very overwhelming very quickly .,education
and i get stressed and anxious and that get translated into being an aggravated person and being unpleasant to be around .,education
but it left to my own device .,education
if i can i to go all in on one thing disappear complete it and then i am open for the next thing .,education
the third one is organization .,education
it is hard for people who have add organization for time and space .,education
now i think there seven different type of add .,education
whats the difference between add adhd ?,education
what are we talking about ?,education
i think there seven type .,education
thats what i learned from imaging .,education
but add attention deficit disorder wa a name given to this thing .,education
it used to be called minimal brain dysfunction before them .,education
by the american psychiatric association with dsmthree diagnosecens statistical manual one thousand nine hundred and eighty .,education
thats what i trained on .,education
one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven for god know what reason .,education
they changed the name to adhd .,education
it used to be add with hyperactivity or add without hyperactivity .,education
and they changed the name to adhd to lump everybody together .,education
the problem is have the people who have this disorder are never hyperactive .,education
and it wa very confusing .,education
and then one thousand nine hundred and ninety four they changed the name again to ad slash hd .,education
highlighting have the people have this or never hyperactive .,education
the name are not scientific .,education
let be super clear about this .,education
there no biology to this .,education
a group of psychiatrist get together and they vote based on what they think the best evidence is an often it is silly .,education
we lost aspirer time .,education
everybody now whether you are elon musk and high functioning autistic get the same diagnosis a someone who in a developmental center that can never live independently .,education
when i first started imaging i am it is not one thing based on imaging .,education
and if we look at your brain ill be able to tell you .,education
type one is classic adhd short attention span distractability disorganized for time and space .,education
we did not talk much about that one but your room your desk your book bag trouble with organization .,education
and you might not that guy .,education
you might be type three .,education
well get to that .,education
people with add tend to be late or on time because they do not start getting ready to go until my god i am late .,education
thats not me either. . i am generally timely .,education
this is why i want to go and get a break .,education
not convinced .,education
one two not that much the not being able to multitask is very male brain thing a opposed to an add thing .,education
disorganization forest procrastination you put thing off put thing on put thing off .,education
i do that until you are mad where somebody else is mad at you .,education
and then five is impulse control .,education
or do thing probably shouldnt do .,education
and it is the break in your brain is vulnerable .,education
and i think those are the five thing .,education
and if you have three out of five you probably do have it .,education
and it sound for you somebody should look at your brain. . and what would you say ?,education
wa it the interrupting at the conference you went to or at the treatment you went to we are all the psychiatrist you have .,education
the interrupting what do you mean ?,education
were you interrupting people and conversation ?,education
or no i do not think .,education
why were they saying that ?,education
am i interrupting you now ?,education
is that what you are saying that ?,education
i get a key to that on the podcast interrupting people too much .,education
if i wa interrupting they did not tell me that i wa .,education
and if i wa doing it i wa probably not consciously aware of doing it .,education
why did they want to drug you ?,education
what did they see ?,education
that they went you have adhd .,education
probably related to addiction issue perhaps ?,education
or coping mechanism that ive developed to focus or the way in which i can use excessive exercise to calm myself down .,education
and it is how do we know unless we look. . it is when i think .,education
what would in a brain scan of a brain with adhd versus a healthy brain ?,education
often healthy at rask and drop with concentration especially in your prefrontal cortex from the third of your brain .,education
an area called the basil ganglion where dopamine work and your cerebellum .,education
healthy at rask drop when you concentrate we need to fix that .,education
and you can fix it with exercise .,education
you can fix it with certain stimulating supplement and sometimes medication can be incredibly helpful .,education
but the problem is what i saw because i am a child psychiatrist and an adult psychiatrist .,education
but what i have to the patient we have at amen clinic have add of one form or another .,education
and what i found there classic short attention span destructability hyperactivity impulse control issue .,education
there inattentive add never hyperactive or terribly impulsive but trouble performing trouble with focus .,education
i have a child with both of those type .,education
type three is overfocus problem is not that you can not pay attention .,education
it is you can not shift your attention .,education
you end up to get stuck on thing .,education
and because you are organized that tends to be the one exception is type three .,education
but these people also tend to be argumentative .,education
our positional of thing do not go their way .,education
they get upset and they can hold on to grudge .,education
and their addiction of choice tends to be thing that calm their brain down whether it is alcohol or marijuana .,education
type four is limbic add .,education
there are emotional brain work too hard and they tend to see the world through dark glass .,education
they have a hallmark add trait plus mild depression .,education
type five is temporal lobe add .,education
often from a head injury .,education
one or both of their temporal lobe hurt .,education
mood instability irritability temper stuff six famous for .,education
it is made it to movie .,education
it is called the ring of fire where the brain is not low in activity .,education
it is high in activity .,education
it is working way too hard often due to inflammation and type seven is anxious add .,education
and it is their level of anxiety that get some place on time but they have to work much harder than their colleague .,education
and all of these are rooted in genetics .,education
some is rooted in trauma but add is very genetic .,education
it is genetic that if i see an adhd child and i do not see it at all in their mom side or their dad side i am looking at the kid to see if he look their parent .,education
it is that genetic .,education
yeah i do not know if i could identify it in my family tree .,education
i am not qualified to .,education
but it can also be caused .,education
by a concussion .,education
and if you come to see me one of thing we are going to ask you five or six seven ten time .,education
have you ever had a brain injury ?,education
have you ever fallen out of a tree off of fan ?,education
do not win to a shallow pool .,education
have you ever had a concussion playing sport or car accident ?,education
i look forward to getting my brain scanned .,education
itll be super interesting .,education
we can do this .,education
let talk about raising mentally strong kid .,education
you handed me this book .,education
perhaps you can give u the thesis .,education
why did you write this book ?,education
and what is it that you are trying to say here ?,education
child are at the worst in recorded history a far a mental health problem .,education
the level of anxiety depression adhd selfharming behavior is out of control .,education
brand new study .,education
fifty four of teenage girl report being persistently sad .,education
thirty two have thought of killing themselves .,education
twenty four have planned to kill themselves .,education
and thirteen have tried to kill themselves .,education
school are overwhelmed by the incident of kid on medication and the kid suffering with panic attack and other mental health problem .,education
it is awful whats happening .,education
and what i learned early in my career is the most effective intervention to raise mentally healthy kid is parenting strategy .,education
and the first one obviously if you want mentally healthy child you have to be mentally strong yourself .,education
i talk about how important that is .,education
and then there this system that ive become attached to that i think is effective .,education
and i wrote the book with my friend dr. charles faye who is the president of the love and logic institute .,education
and that program is very important to me personally because when we brought that into our home it became much happier .,education
and in the book we mixed neuroscience and the program ive been using for year with love and logic .,education
we combine these two program to do what we think of a the latest innovation in parenting .,education
every parent want mentally strong kid .,education
we want our kid to be confident kind responsible all of these thing .,education
and obviously kid into it how you are behaving .,education
thats much more important than whats coming out of your mouth .,education
if your if your behavior is not matched what you are saying they are paying attention to the behavior much more than the word .,education
but we are where are even the best intention going wrong ?,education
the statistic that you you quoted are devastating .,education
there a lot of thing contributing to that of course .,education
but where is it where we think we are doing the thing and perhaps we are misguided .,education
we are rescuing child way too much .,education
we are solving their problem because of our low self esteem .,education
and i am guilty of this .,education
i think for the first three and i love all my child .,education
and if you do not feel great about yourself you get self esteem by doing for your child when they could cure themselves .,education
and then what you do is you create incompetent people .,education
when a child come to you and say on board to often parent then scramble to get them the latest video game or take them someplace rather than give them the problem back .,education
i wonder what you are going to do about that .,education
and then be loving enough to not fix them .,education
my wife and chloe are twenty old when she wa seven theyd have these monster homework battle .,education
and i am a child skytrust and i look at hannah and go youve done second grade get out of this fight .,education
but three of her friend recommended parenting with love and logic .,education
and thats the foundational principle .,education
let kid solve their own problem .,education
be a good coach be a resource do not solve it .,education
and when tana understood it she announced a chloe sweet heart ive done second grade .,education
i am never ever again going to ask you to do your homework .,education
it is on you .,education
and if you do not do it youll have to be with the consequence .,education
and chloe had fit and said i never said it wa going to do my homework .,education
i am not going to do it now stormed off came back twenty minute later .,education
shes now a junior a chapman no one ever asked her to do her homework again .,education
and she had a four.two out of high school .,education
shes responsible .,education
she competent and consoled her own problem .,education
we go wrong when we steal their self esteem by solving their problem .,education
for example chloe knew it if she forgot her homework nobody bringing it to her .,education
if she forgot her sweater on a cold day nobody bringing it to her .,education
if she forgot her lunch it take twenty four hour to starve .,education
nobody bringing it to her .,education
and she only forgot those thing and now shes forgetting anything .,education
yeah you become self directed .,education
you developed that self efficacy that will serve you later in life .,education
self esteem come from performing esteemable act on behalf of yourself .,education
and if you are always rushing in to solve the problem or rescue you are depriving your child of the opportunity to learn those things. . it is a shortterm gain longterm pain situation. . a lot of time crunched .,education
parent are let me solve the problem because i ive other thing to do .,education
and i can fix this rather than allow the child to scramble and mess up and figure it out on their own because sometimes thats not convenient. . and it is also not gold directed .,education
principle number one is now what you want ?,education
what parent do you want to be ?,education
and what child do you want to raise ?,education
ask yourself that question ask the other parent that question .,education
parent do we want to be ?,education
and what child do we want to raise ?,education
because then your behavior stem from whatever mission statement you create .,education
and then the second thing is attachment .,education
and that requires two thing .,education
time actual physical time .,education
and listening parent talk way too much .,education
and we have all this great knowledge and all these great experience .,education
we want to pour it into their little head and they tune u out .,education
if you do active listening with them theyll be close to you .,education
but if you tell them how to think and you interrupt them it is very bad for the relationship for the attachment .,education
and then i have an exercise in the book thats gold .,education
it is worked every time .,education
i think parent who do it the way ask is twenty minute a day with a kid .,education
do something with them .,education
they want to do .,education
and during that time no command no question no direction .,education
and when i first figured it out and then i saw it work and it worked in a work .,education
my literary agent at the time carl he called me up and he said i am having trouble with my twoyearold .,education
he had a child later in life .,education
and laura wa too and shes she never want anything to do with me .,education
what do you mean ?,education
i am do this .,education
and i told him a special time twenty minute a day do something with her that she want to do which mean sit on the floor and play with her block .,education
and he that will not work .,education
he tended to be oppositional .,education
i said you need to do this .,education
i am going to call you in three week .,education
get the party started .,education
and three week later i called him up .,education
and i am hey carl it is daniel .,education
daniel she will not leave me alone .,education
all she want to do is be with me .,education
i sit or walk in the door .,education
she grab my leg .,education
she want her time. . because it is not that what we all wanted .,education
unless our parent wa awful we all wanted their attention .,education
and i am one of seven .,education
my mother after ive been to your dish about how she did .,education
but because my dad wa never home we did not have a relationship .,education
and one thousand nine hundred and seventy two turned eighteen .,education
he told me if i voted for my governor and the country would go to hell .,education
and because we did not have a relationship i voted for my governor .,education
and the country went to hell but it had nothing to do with my governor .,education
it wa because of nixon and watergate .,education
and i having influence with my kid but there no influence without connection .,education
there different kind of attachment .,education
also i think thats very wise .,education
and it is also very straightforward and doable invest your time in your child .,education
be interested in what they are interested in .,education
when they tell you something do not lecture them or tell them why they are wrong say tell me more .,education
and be on their level where they do not feel judged or you are going to explain something to them ?,education
i think thats great advice .,education
on the opposite end of the spectrum from someone your father is the very enmeshed parent .,education
thats a different attachment disorder where they are overly invested in their child being and the child becomes a vehicle for their own selfesteem .,education
they are projecting all of this emotional baggage on their child .,education
and the child then is shouldering this responsibility to make their parent feel .,education
and whether that projection is ambition or their own insecurity or their own dream that were never realized the child on an unconscious level is is subsuming all of that .,education
and that becomes problematic .,education
i to think of good parent good coach .,education
and ive been blessed to work with some amazing coach .,education
and good coach notice what you do and they teach .,education
bad coach notice what you do wrong and focus on it .,education
and in the book there a whole section on why i collect penguin .,education
i have two thousand penguin .,education
it is a little weird .,education
not reallyzed penguin .,education
penguin pen cup doll tie i have a penguin weather rain a penguin vacuum bizarre .,education
but my oldest child anton who i adopted he wa hard for me .,education
he wa a manative oppositional .,education
and i talked to my supervisor .,education
and she said you need more one on one time with him .,education
and i took him to a place called sea life park which is in hawaii .,education
it is on a wahoo .,education
it is sea world .,education
they had sea animal show and we had a great day .,education
whale show sea lion show dolphin show .,education
and at the end of the day i took him to the fat freddy show .,education
he wa a humbled penguin chubby .,education
but he amazing .,education
he climbed a twenty foot diving board went to the end would bounce and jump in the water bold with his nose countered with his flipper jumped through a papaya .,education
and at the end of the show the trainer asked him to go get something .,education
and he brought it back .,education
and time stood still for me because in my head i am damn i asked my kid to get something .,education
and he want to have a discussion for twenty minute .,education
and then he doesnt want to do it .,education
and i knew my son wa smarter than the penguin .,education
and i realized i wa the problem .,education
and i went up to the trainer afterwards .,education
and i am howd you get freddy to do all these cool thing ?,education
and she said unlike parent whenever freddy doe anything what i want him to do i notice him .,education
i give him a hug and i give him a fish .,education
and the light went on in my head that when my son did thing i liked i wasnt paying attention .,education
but when he did not i gave him a lot of attention because i did not want to raise bad kid .,education
and i collect penguin a a way to remind myself every day i am shaping the people around me by what i pay attention .,education
it is this this totem to bring you back to that place .,education
thats cool .,education
you mentioned the peril that many teenage girl are experiencing currently when a young person reach a certain age it is natural for them to differentiate .,education
and sometimes if not often the communication suffers with the parent a a result because the kid is no longer interested in hanging out with the parent a much they got their own thing .,education
they want to shut the door to their bedroom and do their thing and not be bothered .,education
there many thing we talk about in the book attachment protects and you need to supervise your kid until their brain develops .,education
you need to understand normal development your prefrontal cortex the front third of your brain largest in human and any other animal by far is not fully myelinated until you are about twenty five .,education
and we think of eighteenyearolds a adult it is ridiculous from a neuroscience standpoint and the insurance industry knew this way before a neuroscientist knew it .,education
when do your insurance rate change ?,education
when you are twenty five they go down significantly because you may better decision because you have more myelinated frontal lobe .,education
and myelization is important .,education
when you are born there not much of it going on in your brain .,education
about two month the back of your brain becomes myelinated and better which is why when you smile at a newborn they do not smile back .,education
but when they are about eight week old you smile at them .,education
they begin to connect with you .,education
myelization think of a copper wire or a neuron a brain cell .,education
myelization is it get wrapped with shewilded fatty substance insulation on a copper wire and that neuron work ten to one hundred time faster .,education
and your prefrontal cortex the most human thoughtful part of you is not fully myelinated until you are about twenty five .,education
and it is undergoing wild development from fourteen to twenty five yet thats when many parent advocate their role .,education
and send kid off even though they are not mature enough to go hang out with a bunch of other unmyelinated brain the joint sorority and fraternity and all sort of bad thing happen to kid then .,education
i think we need to have supervision in a way not thats intrusive but it is i am watching .,education
i want to know where you are .,education
i want to know when you are coming home .,education
and kid hate it .,education
but what ?,education
they hate it more if you do not do it because that mean you do not care .,education
whats the council for the parent who struggling to bridge that communication gap with the teenager who leaving me alone i do not want to talk to you or how wa your day fine the naval gazing that occurs around that age ?,education
yeah i think try to be in their space much a you can and be a good listener .,education
there always two word to default to firm and kind .,education
if you understand the research we talk about this in raising mentally strong kid .,education
it is parent who are firm and loving do way better than parent who are loving and permissive .,education
permessiveness raise the most unhealthy child whether you are loving and permissive or hostile and permissive permessiveness is not good .,education
it is good to have boundary and rule and kid should have chore .,education
and the problem is i would love for people to write down this statement i only do nice thing for people who treat me with respect .,education
and to often child will be very disrespectful and the parent will go out of their way to give them thing because of their own guilt .,education
i do nice thing for people who treat me with respect .,education
and i am always nudging to have that time .,education
and even if they reject you i keep coming back but do not bend over and do all these nice thing for people who are rude to you .,education
thats not good .,education
what is your counsel around device ?,education
clearly some portion probably a large portion of the depression the suicidal ideation etc .,education
thats on the rise particularly with teenage girl is a result of on some level social medium that comparison that take place the twenty fourseven access to what your peer group is doing at all time .,education
the bullying and criticism that occurs there parent i think are often confounded and confused about how to manage that .,education
the self absorption what social medium lead to is a toxic level of it about me .,education
and my counsel delay is long a you can .,education
i would hold out a long a you could and then supervise it .,education
and if you are paying for it it is you can have this make sure they are parental security thing on it because having eightyearold boy exposed to pedographies a very bad thing for the developing brain .,education
talk about wearing out your pleasure owner .,education
you need parental device delay it and then if they have it it is you only can keep this if i have access to it .,education
i think it is important to have supervision .,education
you have to be their frontal lobe until there is develop because there dangerous thing out on the web .,education
you get it a long a it is not a problem .,education
those kid who play video game theyll have a fit when you tell them to stop the video game need to go away .,education
need to go away because you are the parent thats your role .,education
ive sent way too many child to video game addiction program .,education
i do not that .,education
and they are but a friend are doing it it is you can do it a long a it is not creating a problem .,education
and i think you should limit it because the device and social medium and video game they dump dopamine .,education
they were purposefully created to add to you .,education
they use the same principle that la vega us to win money in gambling which is intermittent reinforcement .,education
i am not going to reinforce you all the time .,education
we are going to do it every often and it dump dopamine .,education
what doe that mean ?,education
you have two pleasure center in your brain .,education
they are called the nucleus of cumbans part of the basal ganglion .,education
and when you get excited about something that produce a little bit of dopamine push on the pleasure center .,education
but the more you push on it the harder you push on it think about these violent video game .,education
pretty soon nucleus of cumbans becomes numb and you need more and more to get the same effect .,education
you start with an addiction toward the end of the addiction .,education
you were not getting the out of fact that you did in the beginning ?,education
because your pleasure center had been worn out .,education
we are wearing them out earlier than ever before .,education
and i think thats one of the big reason we are the escalating incident of depression .,education
the social medium site are similarly designed .,education
similarly designed .,education
there are scientifically devised to addict in the same way that a slot machine or a video game is designed and mind share .,education
thats what happens .,education
that becomes tricky when you have a sixteen year old or an eighteen year old .,education
and part of being a member of their cohort or their tribe is being conversant on these platform and being in communication on these device .,education
it is not a easy a saying i am taking your phone away because thats the same a saying you are being kicked out of your community .,education
yeah but you have to be careful .,education
you have to be willing to do that in order to show love which is super visioned .,education
if a parent is seeing their child sink into a depressive state what is the advice that you would give ?,education
the first thing is do not put them on an antidepressant .,education
thats not the first thing to do .,education
now maybe the seventh or eighth thing to do .,education
but the first thing is to evaluate their lifestyle .,education
to often child are taking their device to bed and they are not sleeping .,education
and i think it is a good family habit for everybody including the parent but their device away .,education
or for you to take your kid i had one patient recently the got a new phone had an ipad and wa up till to a clock three oclock four oclock .,education
and he wasnt doing in school .,education
it is yeah sleep to write people do not do in school .,education
supervising technology i think is critical .,education
i teach a high school course called brand thrive by twenty five .,education
weve done it for fifteen year .,education
it is been on seven different country all fifty state .,education
we teach kid to love and care for their brand .,education
and what i found is the going idea about teenager is parent have lost influence and their friend are more important and they will not listen is wrong .,education
if you are bonded to them they listen .,education
you have to explain it to them and give them reason why these company use neuroscientist to addict your brain and steal your mind .,education
these vaping company they are making money off of your early death .,education
you have to educate them and get them angry .,education
when i call the evil ruler if i wa an evil ruler and i wanted to create mental illness what would i do ?,education
i create vaping device and go this is a healthy form of smoking or id make them think marijuana is innocuous clearly it is not .,education
or id give them a device thats clearly addictive and ha all sort of side effect and go have fun with this and other people your age are doing it it is probably .,education
when you educate them my twentyyearold she know the time a day that shes on her social medium site and she limit it and now shes doing this thing is how much sleep can i get ? ?,education
and she find i do better with nine and a half hour and i do it eight hour .,education
ill say wow smart is that that shes tracking it she us device or ring to track it and it is because she understands it .,education
rather than do this do not do that but thats not how poor it is relationship and then this is your brain .,education
how can you take care of your brain and thats what we do with brain thrive by twenty five ?,education
from the historic campus of hillsdale college in hillsdale michigan where the good the true and the beautiful our top nurtured and honored this is the radiofree hillsdale hour bringing the activity and education of the college to listener across the country .,education
i knew that if i insisted on putting the language in and agreement with them that i would be caught a foul of mrs. reagan which wa not a very pleasant situation .,education
this is your host scott bertram .,education
welcome to the radiofree hillsdale hour part of the hillsdale college podcast network that wa ken kachigian author of behind closed or in the room with reagan and nixon .,education
and for this election week we spend time later on in today program with a band who ha spent lot of time behind closed door with both ronald reagan and richard nixon .,education
first we are joined by dr. kathleen otool a system provost for ktwelve education at hillsdale college .,education
dr. otool thanks much for joining u . thank you for having me .,education
i am discussing today in appedgey road a while ago in the detroit news .,education
classical charter school can help reverse covidlearning loss and can be found at detroitnews.com .,education
start with the basic i guess .,education
are we what is the data ?,education
are we still catching up from this learning loss that wa suffered during the covid pandemic and then the subsequent school shutdown ?,education
some people might take a look and say they are a little behind .,education
what are the possible ramification ?,education
why should we care that student are behind where they should be and if they continue to lag behind where they should be in their education ?,education
the data we have is regarding reading and math score and i can talk about the effect of a of a poor reading and math education over the course of a student k through twelve year .,education
but first i think the point need to be made about the habit that are developed .,education
anyone who ha young child i have two very young child now they are two and three know that the name of the game is building habit .,education
and if you do not build the habit chaos will rain .,education
thats the phase that i am in now .,education
and then of course understanding the difference between learning time and play time .,education
and those two thing in hillsdale affiliated school are not mixed both are very important .,education
but learning time is one thing play time is another thing .,education
and they are both important but need to be separate .,education
that whole way of going about your life a a five or six year old is new .,education
and you are entering school for the first time and learning this ability to get yourself into learning mode that you will need to have for the rest of your childhood and into adulthood .,education
if these habit are not formed they will not naturally happen .,education
they have to be formed eventually .,education
and there a a there a golden opportunity to form those habit when child are young becomes more difficult a they get older .,education
let look at reading and math .,education
there is two different thing happening when it come to those subject and a child early learning about math first .,education
learning mathematics is building a skyscraper .,education
it begin with everyone know the beginning of the mathematics skyscraper .,education
you learn addition first and then you learn subtraction and learn multiplication and division .,education
why is it that way ?,education
is it because weve always done it that way ?,education
no it is because thats the logical order in which those four essential mathematical concept have to be taught .,education
you can not understand multiplication unless you understand addition first .,education
it can not be done .,education
same thing with division and subtraction .,education
it is got to proceed in that order .,education
the rest of math education is that way too .,education
thats the beauty of mathematics .,education
it is pure and clean .,education
and the order in which it need to be taught is logical and we can know it .,education
and if we follow it it will work .,education
other subject are it is a little bit le clear although the same principle apply .,education
these student who who lost math instruction in the early in the early year of the pandemic and who were not given an opportunity to go back and build the foundation of their math skyscraper are at risk .,education
because the rest of the math skyscraper is being built .,education
and if there are hole in the early stage of the foundation itll be shaky and itll eventually topple .,education
the math skyscraper tends to topple when student encounter a more advanced mathematical concept .,education
the first most difficult one or the first difficult concept you encounter is fraction .,education
and that come about third or fourth grade .,education
and if you do not have division which mean having multiplication subtraction addition fully under your belt you will not be able to get fraction .,education
and itll happen again with algebra .,education
and these student these student will start to show their the gap in their foundation .,education
if we do not go back and fill them in properly .,education
reading is a similar story .,education
the acquisition of reading skill is a process that go on throughout a child k through twelve education begin with decoding english word .,education
and there a period kindergarten through third grade where we talk about a child learning to read .,education
and then in about third grade a child ha enough reading ability that they can start reading to learn .,education
in other word you can give them a text and they have enough ability to decode enough vocabulary enough content knowledge to read that text and get other knowledge from it other than how to decode english .,education
if a child learning to read foundation is not built properly a it already wasnt being built properly in a lot of american education .,education
but it definitely wa not being built properly when child were not going to school .,education
then their ability to read to learn will be damaged .,education
and reading is in a sense the most important thing you learn in school because without the ability to read you reach a point in your life where you can not learn anything new .,education
from a teacher perspective can you talk perhaps a little about that challenge then of having to expedite the learning process or to help those child catch up in the classroom to make up for those loss ?,education
yeah thats hard .,education
and we run into this all the time because we work with brand new school .,education
and they do not start with kindergarten .,education
they start with kindergarten through sixth grade or sometimes more than that .,education
my own school started kindergarten through tenth grade .,education
and we were welcoming student into the first grade of first year of school who were in seventh and eighth grade .,education
theyd never studied any formal grammar .,education
theyd never studied singapore math which is the logical way that we go about it .,education
theyd never had phonics when they were in elementary school .,education
and they had all of these gap in their foundation .,education
the good news is child are made to learn .,education
that is what childhood is is learning .,education
they are not u . they are open to learning and they are nimble and they are able to absorb new information quickly .,education
and it is not a difficult a you might think .,education
the challenge is knowing how to fill the gap .,education
and we would do thing at the beginning of the year by have a two week intensive on english grammar for new student .,education
and theyd spend a couple of hour of day reviewing the thing that the rest of the classmate had done before .,education
and they were able .,education
they were able with a few month of concerted work and support by the teacher and their family to catch up .,education
any child can do that thing .,education
if teacher are given the opportunity to slow down and fill in those gap .,education
and it may seem wed be losing time by doing that .,education
but the shaky foundation will continue to be shaky .,education
you must not go forward .,education
you have to fill it in .,education
dr. kathleen otoole is with u . she is assistant provost for k12 education at hillsdale college .,education
hillsdale k12 ha a network of these classical charter school across the country .,education
what doe the available data now tell u about the effectiveness of those classical charter school to help in this fight ?,education
the data that we have about the classical school the effect of the covid shutdown on classical school show that the classical school had le decline in student achievement .,education
and i think thats for a very simple reason .,education
classical school have a plan for student education kindergarten through 12th grade .,education
and they were able when student were no longer attending school or whether they were attending school remotely to identify exactly what instruction wa being lost .,education
and then when they had the opportunity to be back with the kid they knew exactly what the plan should be in order to get everyone back on track .,education
on top of that looking at hillsdale school and thinking back to that time we were very eager to get back in the classroom wa student in person a quickly a wa legal and safe .,education
and in that time when it wa not possible to be with student we kept the principle of inperson instruction the life for a much a possible .,education
and zoom instruction wa synchronous .,education
and we tried a hard a we could to replicate the energy and the engagement that in an inperson class .,education
i remember visiting some of our school in colorado and i watched a teacher .,education
this student it wa a time when some of the student had come back to school in person but parent had the ability to keep some of them at home if they preferred .,education
and i watched a teacher with a classroom of maybe eighteen student and then she had six or eight on zoom .,education
and she wa teaching the zoom student in the inperson student simultaneously .,education
but she wouldnt have wanted to do it any other way because she knew the power of being there with her student .,education
a question we should answer i think which occurs when we talk about these classical charter school is that might be good for some student but is it for everyone ?,education
is it classical education the one offered at hillsdale college classical charter school ?,education
is it fit for everyone ?,education
or is it for only a particular type of student ?,education
it is for everyone .,education
classical education is an orderly course of study that is rounded and it happens in classroom with teacher who are excellent at explaining .,education
there is no child that will not benefit from that .,education
the course of study is good for everyone to know .,education
regardless of where you come from regardless of where you are going .,education
and because the instruction is vivid engaging you learn more in a classical school than you do in a le personal le energetic environment .,education
i think classical school because of their origin in private education have a reputation sometimes of being elite only for tuition paying family or something but thats an accident .,education
thats not inherent to classical education .,education

ken thanks much for joining u . good great to be here .,education
thanks for having me on .,education
always wonderful to hear the story from someone who wa there .,education
and a they say in the room we are all thing happened .,education
i want to begin by asking you about your experience overall .,education
the american people and our listener have some idea of the culture or the white house that we have picked up from other book that we have picked up from popgits or culture tv show .,education
is the portrayal that perhaps most of u have and the perception true to what you experienced in the nixon reagan administration ?,education
television and movie are dramatization .,education
they to get people excited and tv show the west wing and movie frost nixon and others are hyped up .,education
generally it is getting you get folk over a state of view what it is in the white house .,education
movie all the president men .,education
and usually they bear homey a flyresum with serality .,education
but all movie are portrayal and dramatization .,education
if you want to get into the meat you need to talk to people whove been there me .,education
and i want to say and my book is a which is why i am glad you have me on .,education
because in a lot of the book about biography and memoir a lot of the memoir most of the memoir about reagan year frankly have been ghost print and in a lot of my colleague and do not have time .,education
then not sugar and larry speaks and mike d. we are in jim baker chief staff and all of them had ghost writer write their book .,education
and they do not get the real feel for it .,education
to get real honest and revealing a count of what it is to be there in the room a ive written the book you have to have someone who give an honest account .,education
and i took very detailed note of everything i did what president nixon and president reagan .,education
what i convey is almost transcription now .,education
it is not the white house tape but it is pretty close .,education
and i try to do portrayal of the personality and character .,education
and i try to do it in an honest way a best i can .,education
and what you get in the movie and tv show are not i wouldnt take i wouldnt take those to the bank .,education
can you work for president nixon work for president reagan both with deep root in the state of california which now is new a a leftist haven .,education
but then wa wa radically in the presidential election and had haven of conservatism .,education
do you think that the culture of california helped to form both of their approach to politics in washington ?,education
but i think california wa not we did not have forty odd million people back in one thousand nine hundred and forty six when dick nixon wa elected to the congress .,education
and when ronald reagan got elected to the governorship the culture of california wa wa wholly different .,education
in fact i did not work for those two president .,education
i helped who wa the lead strategist for governor george duke maynard when he won the governorship in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two and i helped dan lunger and the getlife attorney general in one thousand nine hundred and ninety and i worked with beat wilson .,education
the concept of radical taxation began with jerry brown frankly who did not have much of a sense of controlling government .,education
he wa off there in some sorry id land and lost control of winning me and got into a second term when he returned to the governorship .,education
thing changed pretty dramatically beginning in the 90 and in the turn of the century .,education
in governor schwarzenegger wa always a republican wa not in the same republican mold a richard nixon in rome reagan .,education
that culture shift changed largely also because i would have to say the union start taking over the school and had a huge impact on the education of our child and the university .,education
they give a very balanced view of their course but now i think thats different .,education
i think thats whats happened to california over the last few year .,education
we will not get into everything of course inside behind closed door the do book for the country again .,education
there a wonderful part at the beginning where you take u through the prep for the frost nixon interview .,education
i am a larger watergate scale though i know you lament that nixon did not end up having the support of a house and set up republican .,education
they did not stand up for him during the ofgate scandal and postwater gate to get scandal .,education
why did not he find that support ?,education
what happened ?,education
i think there wa overall fatigue that it is an interesting question you asked .,education
and i think looking back people forget that nixon came into office bearing an enormous burden that wa left with a snarling at his doorstep that wa vietnam war left to him by the kennedy johnson administration .,education
five hundred and fortyzero men in vietnam with five hundred of them being killed every month with another thousand casualty .,education
and he wa trying to draw down that war .,education
and the protest which began under johnson spilled over into nixon administration with the massive protest all across the country beginning after nixon took office .,education
the republican in congress were in the position of having to defend what then turned into nixon war although it wasnt nixon war .,education
it wa kennedy and johnson war but they had to defend nixon war policy a he wa trying to bring the war down .,education
and he had to continue the defense of that what wa going on in vietnam war because he wa trying to balance off china against the soviet union because there were thermonuclear war power .,education
and he wa trying to offset what wa happening on a muchgrinder scale .,education
what wa what took place wa he wa calling on his colleague republican colleague in congress for their support for monetary support and for financial support in a congress that wa dominated by democrat .,education
and by then by the time watergate hit in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two and then through up to seventy four after two year of fighting watergate the republican in congress were tired .,education
they were tired of defending the vietnam policy .,education
they were tired of defending the medium attack on watergate that were all and the partisan attack from their colleague in congress .,education
they shot up by thirty five percent .,education
now nixon wa faced with the recession .,education
and american were angry across the board .,education
republican in congress in the senate house were faced with having to defend an administration that wa burning the burden of the end of the vietnam war which ended with the peace talk at the beginning of one thousand nine hundred and seventy three with the burden of watergate .,education
and now you have a recession in one thousand nine hundred and seventy three .,education
and with the midterm election coming up and a couple month away from august of one thousand nine hundred and seventy four they it is not the bravery doesnt take place when theyll win you are on the ballot quite often .,education
they were tired of fighting .,education
ken kitchigin with u is new book behind closed door in the room with reagan and nixon .,education
chief speech writer senior political adviser for president reagan you have the watergate scandal with nixon you have iran consra with ronald reagan .,education
how would you compare or contrast the approach in dealing with those topic in those various administration ?,education
watergate wa dragged out for for two year and it wa pillar between the toh room wa that both president had very little knowledge of a lot of the true fact going into obviously richard nixon .,education
and your listener are aware .,education
and a lot of people think that he instituted the breaking which wa thats crazy .,education
he had known all of the watergate breaking .,education
he did not authorize it yet .,education
and i think the do of that .,education
and he wa getting bad information about who wa in charge .,education
he wa getting denial from the leadership of the that his campaign committee about who instituted it .,education
he instantly went to his backup plan which wa political damage control .,education
in reagan case pretty much the same .,education
he did not have the full fact instantly with regard to iran consra .,education
he did not he authorized the weapon transfer that got him in trouble .,education
it wa rather confusing situation .,education
i think he thought he wa doing the thing .,education
but then he wasnt getting all the but i think proper information .,education
and i think what he thought he had done wa the thing for his his foreign policy but he did not realize that he wa getting in meshed in something that wa deeper than it wa .,education
and in both case thing got out of control more than they wanted to .,education
i think people need to understand that president are not dealing with the the scandal when they are in the presidency .,education
theyve got a lot of thing they are dealing with .,education
they are dealing with national defense they are dealing with the daily activity of the presidency .,education
they are dealing with daily intelligence report that they are getting they are getting intelligence brief every morning from their national security council .,education
they are dealing with their massive amount of information coming from their congressional liaison .,education
the presidency doesnt deal with the scandal that come inside their door the cell there bombarded every day with other event .,education
you do not sit there .,education
in a lot of how i am going to resolve the scandal thats dealing in my front door .,education
and a lot of time the easiest route is to not be held daily with whatever the scandal is and put it on the back burner .,education
and thats what happened .,education
i think both with flaregant and ron concentral until it to both of them got out of control .,education
ken there lot in behind closed door about ronald regans wife nancy reagan .,education
and the relationship she had both with the president and the relationship he had with you and other staffer .,education
you run the gamut from early in the administration .,education
you describe her a being a chief of staff .,education
ronald regans tough guy when it wa needed .,education
and then you take it all the way through this i guess wed say conflict .,education
you had with her around the one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven state of the union of dress .,education
the president wanted to include some language about protecting the unborn .,education
nancy behind him shaking her head .,education
how would you describe nancy reagan role in the president administration ?,education
how important wa she in shaping the message that eventually went to the american public ?,education
she wa a there wa no enclosure to the president and mrs. reagan .,education
he relied on her much for advice on everything .,education
if there wa good cop bad cop she had to be bad cop she wa bad cop .,education
and if he wanted to convey a message that he wa uncomfortable and conveying sometimes he would have mrs. rady can convey it .,education
and she wa helpful in the campaign of eighty for example i described wheres the chief of staff because she helped bring order to the campaign .,education
if there wa to me she wa very helpful in teaching me what wa the best way for him to communicate sometimes .,education
and then later in the eighty four campaign when the president wa getting bad advice from his chief of staff and his deputy chief of staff on how to communicate in the campaign .,education
mrs. reagan got them all straightened out .,education
and she wa my ally in that respect .,education
but she disagreed with the president on this particular policy of abortion .,education
and the scene i described wa where the president in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven stated union address wa refinalizing the speech .,education
said to me i do not have the exact word in front of me but it wa word to the effect can .,education
we do not have a message here for our friend about protecting protecting an aborn .,education
and usually i have those in my speech .,education
and mrs. reagan wa standing behind him and gesturing to me shaking her head to no no no .,education
and i wa caught in the middle .,education
it wa a very very uncomfortable situation .,education
on the one hand he wanted the language in the speech .,education
on the other hand she wa vigorously aggressively shaking her head to keep the language out of the speech .,education
and i think she wa being influenced .,education
i do not know where she wa being influenced perhaps by her family perhaps because she thought that that language wa not politically correct .,education
i do not know what her motive wa .,education
but i knew that if i insisted on putting the language in and agreement with them that i would be caught a foul of mrs. reagan which wa not a very pleasant situation .,education
ive concocted a situation where i convince the president where youve always your friend know where your heart lie and youve included all your other speech .,education
and i think this may be this one time if you only let out you can be forgiven .,education
and it wa i do not know it wa i felt i wa betraying him in a way but then on the other hand maybe i wa saving myself from getting my head cut off .,education
i it wa talk about being between sola and corruptus that wa one of those situation .,education
ken cachigian with u who book behind closed door in the room with reagan and nixon you advised nine presidential campaign and in particular of course nixon and reagan .,education
and every president is different .,education
every candidate is different .,education
every campaign is different .,education
there one central theme that work in every campaign that richard nixon that advised president reagan in one thousand nine hundred and eighty .,education
and thats one of the theme of the book by the way that people did not know about that nixon advised reagan secretly in eighty and eighty four .,education
people will find out in the book thats very important and that nixon put into memo to reagan .,education
and that is that the economy is a very central issue on people mind .,education
and that go back if you think about it that go back to the 20th century go back to the day of pover and fdr and truman and kennedy and the year of all those other campaign people think about the economy .,education
when you think about what happens in people life when they wake up in the morning wrote a bed at night they think about feeding their family paying their rent paying their mortgage how to get buyer every day .,education
and another central point is someone that someone ha the depth to wear the mantle of the leader of the free world .,education
and i think thats an issue .,education
can kachigian is the director emeritus of the richard dixon foundation board of director veteran of nine presidential campaign chief speechwriter and senior political advisor for ronald reagan and the author of the new book behind closed door in the room with reagan and nixon .,education
can thanks much for joining u today on the radio for a great day of hour .,education
great to be here .,education
thank you .,education

fight u on x we are at hillsdale radio .,education
we now hear excerpt from a recent lecture by clay travis cohost of the clay and buckshow and founder of out kick .,education
his lecture titled wokeness in sport wa delivered in april of two thousand and twenty four at a hillsdale college event in bellevue washington .,education
clay travis begin by telling u about how he entered the world of sport journalism and why sport is important .,education
i came into the world of sport a a lawyer with the idea that sport wasnt escape from the serious thing in life .,education
a toy chest is the way it is described of life that sport if you read the newspaper and i still to read old school newspaper .,education
i am sure some of you do is one of the only section if not the only section that regularly celebrates achievement not failure .,education
the least read sport because it is the ultimate meritocracy .,education
the best man or woman win not the best man pretending to be a woman .,education
and what they have done what i saw it and look i got into it a a diehard southeast and conference football fan .,education
i love college football .,education
it is one of my passion .,education
i got into it because i wanted to escape the serious thing in life and the thing that i loved about sport .,education
ive my first book .,education
i wrote wa dixie land delight about going around to all twelve sec football stadium .,education
thats a fan .,education
what i loved about it wa it brought everybody together .,education
white black asian hispanic male female if you have ever been in a crowd .,education
your team win a game .,education
a you are highfiving everybody around you and that stadium or that arena you do not think about their race you do not think about their gender you do not think about their political belief .,education
that is a uniquely connective moment .,education
that janitor and that neurosurgeon would be on equal playing field when it came to their opinion .,education
ive made this analogy for a while .,education
we have created identity politics and tried to transmit it to the world of sport .,education
think about how often you hear somebody say now .,education
their identity a a prelude to the opinion they are about to share .,education
why in the world should i care what you look ?,education
i care about the quality of your opinion .,education
how did that happen ?,education
how did the left manage to take over sport ?,education
travis continues explaining why we need to have thing in common and how sport help give u that common bond .,education
what are we seeing ?,education
i talked to our commentary wa interesting to me we were talking during the meal .,education
he said everybody ha to take the same course .,education
you have to have a common language .,education
i took my family to italy .,education
i work way too much but last spring break we went to italy .,education
we toured all over the place my kid were another cathedral .,education
if youve got young kid they were another one dad .,education
but i wa blown away by it because i love the idea of someone being committed to their craft that they tried to make one thing infinitely more beautiful than what otherwise be that will outlast their life .,education
and while i wa there i thought to myself what ha been built in my life that anybody would travel to go see hundred of year from now .,education
i wa born in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine .,education
i can not think of a single edifice that is incredible and that people are committed to that it will still matter in four hundred year .,education
and the need for how did they do that turn out western civilization is a profoundly good thing .,education
and what i do not hear enough people pointing out and i think sport is a big part of this is your ability to rip american institution is a luxury of western civilization that ha provided you the opportunity to platform and the freedom with which to do that .,education
we are listening to excerpt from a hillsdale college lecture by clay travis goose to the clay in buccio and founder of outkick thats from april of two thousand and twenty four on wokeness in sport travis explains here how politics began to infiltrate sport .,education
now the truth matter and this is where we all come in and why i am optimistic and how it change .,education
whats wild to me is i think ninety of sport fan understand that men should compete against men and woman should compete against woman .,education
i do not think thats a remotely controversial option .,education
yet the only sport medium company in the world or at least in the united state that will say that is outkick .,education
the market though can win and this is where hillsdale come in and this is where being a voice for truth in a world that is filled with artificiality come in .,education
the great thing about sport is unlike argument .,education
two different side of an argument can happen and you can both leave and you can think you are both one .,education
what i love about sport is it eliminates the uncertainty .,education
we can all argue about who the best man or woman is or who the best team is .,education
game happens and then we all agree .,education
i have never seen the team that lost an tournament show up and try to take the court after they did not have the most point on a scoreboard .,education
everybody agrees with what happens in that contest .,education
over time the truth win because ultimately the market doe decide and i look around now and i say to myself we are the lone voice in the wilderness on this issue .,education
but everywhere i go i see more and more people coming up to be in saying thank you for saying what you said .,education
riley gain who i talked about earlier .,education
shes twenty for three year old .,education
she wa set to go be at dentist .,education
if she hadnt happened to swim against a man pretending to be a woman and she said this is wrong and changed her entire career trajectory to justify against that .,education
it is bravery .,education
it is courage .,education
and finally clay trappis concludes by talking about woman being taken advantage of in athletics and how we almost stand up to help truth prevail .,education
i do not think that this is for the most part .,education
i think it is wrong .,education
but i think it is going to have to be woman talking to other woman and standing up for the reality of what it is to be a woman to keep men from being able to take over woman space .,education
we talk a lot about male privilege white privilege all these thing .,education
i got to be honest with you .,education
i can not think of a higher level of privilege than i am a dude .,education
i am going to pretend to be a woman .,education
you all have to claim that i am a woman and acknowledge it and i am going to become a woman champion .,education
thats whats going on now .,education
thats what wa reinforced an echo ten day ago .,education
where we are is not representative of where america is .,education
and that is why all of you but particularly woman have to rise up and speak out and make your voice heard .,education
because what i believe is the rational common sense american public sport fan is not being served by the marketplace and not being spoken to honestly .,education
thats what we strive to do every single day at outkick which is why the number one thing i hear every day is you say what i wish i could say .,education
and i do believe that the truth will rise again .,education
and i think and believe that outkick is going to be a huge part of that but we have to take back sport and we have to take back honesty and truth .,education
and only then can sport return where i do believe it should be a a place of unity rather than division in the modern american culture .,education
that wa clay trappis cohost of the clay and buckshow his lecture wokeness in sport .,education
you can find the full lecture at freedomliberry.hillsdale.edu .,education

and i had an eye toward doing some consulting .,education
i wa interested in doing leadership development executive coaching and that thing .,education
i got some certification and some training and wa excited to extend my career away away from higher ed and and do some of that but a it turned out .,education

yeah there you go there you go .,education
you mentioned the turn of and how you still serve on the board there today .,education
thank you at least from a higher ed perspective thats probably a good place to start probably where your higher ed journey started if you will .,education
the amount of walking u through your your personal educational journey .,education
and then how that went what you already talked about the fact you attend a return of .,education
but how did you find yourself there walk u through that story .,education
yeah thats thats an interesting story .,education
i wa born and raised in pennsylvania and for those that do not know what turn is in long be texas along way from pennsylvania back in the seventy early 70 when i graduated from high school .,education
it probably wasnt that normal to go that far away from home at least not for country boy me from from middle from central pennsylvania .,education
but my my dad had met the founder of the internal university our g maternal who is a relatively famous industrialist who had over four hundred patent in his career .,education
and did a lot of speaking and my dad bumped into him and heard and speaking with very intrigued by his life story .,education
and then found out that he had founded this i wa a fledgling school at the time it did not start till one thousand nine hundred and forty six it wa opened in one thousand nine hundred and ninety at the tail end of world war ii .,education
but but anyhow .,education
he got me interested in it and and while i wa .,education
not a i did not know that much about our general internal or about industrialist or about invention or anything that and it felt an adventure to go from pennsylvania to texas to go to school .,education
i think maybe ill take him up on that if he willing to help me attend look turtle university back then it wa maternal college .,education
and mostly known for engineering and aviation and technical program and that is not what i ended up in obviously but but but i absolutely never regretted that decision it wa one of the best decision i ever made wa to go to the maternal .,education
and i went on from there to give my master degree at the university of wyoming one of my mentor at the maternal .,education
wa a wyoming grad had his got his phd at wyoming and he wa in the habit of .,education

and then you all if memory serf me correctly you went back to a turnover after that it might write on that .,education
yes my first job out of a graduate school wa to go back and coach .,education
i wa on the faculty for physical education and i did that for seven year and and then .,education
i to tell you how i got into enrollment management you might be interested in that and listen to my .,education
and that but .,education
yeah at the end of that seven year i asked for a leave of absence of maternal .,education
to to work on a doctor will be free and i wa granted that and a i said earlier i chose the university of arkansas education program and i wa at a crossroad .,education
i keep coaching that wa still a possibility and i wa very impressed with the baseball program at arkansas in the coach there and i thought maybe id get a chance to be mentored by a guy .,education
norm debrine and any i wa one reason i went to arkansas .,education
i wa also toying with the idea of an academic career in in exercise science and .,education
and that wa part of my study at the master level and and interestingly when i got had my exit interview with the academic dean of the internal thick berry he .,education
and i made the comment he said we we will guarantee you a job when we give a leave of absence will guarantee you that will hire you back which can not guarantee you itll be in the position that you are in .,education
and we are going to have to fill that position when you are gone and we can not we do not know what what will be open but one thing weve noticed about you and one reason we are willing to give you the .,education
i leave of absence a you seem to have some administrative skill and would you be interested in an administrative role of anything were open and i said sure that wa a third option that .,education
that i that i added to my possibility .,education
it wa a two year leave of absence after a year we had a young family after a year i got a call from what you are not offered me a position of .,education
associate dean of admission and record wa the wa the title and and having a young family and struggling a little bit financially i thought maybe i could finish the back .,education
it never made a big difference in my career but but i did thats how i got into enrollment management because admission and record .,education
while it included mostly record work in the beginning register with any year i wa named the chief .,education
admission officer within a few month i wa named the chief admission .,education
i think i think they thought here you watch he wa a coach he a recruiter therefore he can run an admission office .,education
thats not necessarily the case .,education
it is not the thing that when you are either ten year old you are aspiring for being an enrollment management .,education
you are always looking to be a baseball player .,education
thats what i wanted to be .,education
i wasnt my lap and i ive had a great career .,education
thats thats an awesome story .,education
i think of all the thing that ive known about you and the history .,education
i do not think i ever knew how how you started in in admission thats a thats a great story .,education
the the last thing here here you got here you go roger this and though we can we can help you in the family and better but it is admissions. . ill play .,education
a little bit of a side note there the way i got it is because you are nobody grows up wanting to to go in admission .,education
in sixth grade i do not know if ever told you the story but in sixth grade .,education
i had a we were learning economics and everybody would bring in thing to sell at school and we had faith money to learn economic .,education
and i i brought in chilly willys towards the end of summer little i thought .,education
and i wa selling those thing crazy but the guy next to me a friend of mine named jordan his father wa the dean of admission at kataba college and he gave jordan all these pin and no pad .,education
in little sweetie and all this stuff and and it is a sixth grade or you are enamored with college and he wa selling those thing left and and i thought thats thats what i want to do .,education
i am going to be able to give out pin and no pad and .,education
little i know it and it and it and it and tell a little bit more than that .,education
my goodness thats great talking about the education .,education
excess experience and how they influenced your trajectory obviously when you started there at maternal and started in that position and quickly move to the the chief admission officer enrollment officer .,education
you obviously found a niche you you stay there you stuck there for the the rest of your career .,education
wa there any deviation out of that roger in term of the enrollment side or did you stay all in enrollment .,education
yeah it is interesting to you ask that i wa in and i wa in enrollment reported to me the rest of the thirty year thirty plus year and our thirty thirty year and i wa in higher ed back .,education
but there wa one little detour while it included enrollment management it wa broader than that .,education
i went from maternal to king university i wa king college back then i saw two institution change from college to university which wa .,education
and interesting and wa a part of both of those .,education
and but after about six year at king i wa asked by a colleague of mine to serve on a team of consultant to look at a situation that an institution that wa in crisis it wa bluefield college in virginia .,education
and they were going through some tough time and the board decided to bring in a team of consultant anyhow short short story is at the end of that consulting .,education
experience the board called me back and said they want to talk a little bit more about my part of the report and and they offered me a job .,education
and they said we are big trouble they had lost their entire senior leadership team except for the academic dean and he wa going to retire in a year .,education
and they were in some pretty serious financial trouble those that are from the bluefield area will remember that .,education
i took them up on it i took a job a the chief operating officer to help them put all the piece back together at bluefield and enrollment reported to me but it wa one of many thing that did and i learned .,education
and that wa that wa one of the greatest learning experience i ever had .,education
but within a year they had put thing back we had put thing back together we had some some financing in place we pretty much rebuilt the president cabinet .,education
and they were about to hire a president and king offered for me to come back at that point and i went back and served three more year at king .,education
but but yeah that wa the only detour that that while it included enrollment and that wa a very important part of what wa going on there .,education
luckily the director of admission wa still there but all their cabinet level people including the entire financial aid officer lost all at one time .,education
i wa quite an experience i could i could spend an hour talking about that experience but .,education
but that wa a little bit of a detour and i learned a lot and and i think it helped shape my my the rest of my career .,education
but yeah one year one year that wasnt directly a vp or in charge of enrollment .,education
yeah and those thirty plus year that that youve been in the enrollment industry roger what what have you seen a one of the biggest challenge i think in my career the set to me love it .,education
overcoming student wanting to be closer to home and that that wa certainly a bigger challenge a we look at discount rate thats been a bigger child what a youve seen .,education
let be honest enrollment management the term enrollment management did not exist then it wa more the admission .,education
whats been one of the biggest change you youve seen or youve faced and in your career .,education
yeah it is an interesting question that .,education
in roman man move a brand new concept when i got into it in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four it developed in the 1970s and there were some .,education
flagship university that were using the team the term already i think it started at the university of indiana but not the stake and that wa the first institution to use the term .,education
i remember people making prediction about how and roman management a a career wa going to be something that .,education
i never would have dreamed of and most of the people that worked in enrollment management that i knew at early in my career would have never .,education
i think that that that it would have the change that it did and a lot of those prediction in fact i would say most of them came true .,education
all the different fluctuation and birth rate and and graduation .,education
all of that stuff would way off in the future yet back when i first started and and i ended up living all of that in my career moving into those position and holding senior level position which in the beginning that wasnt .,education
the norm for somebody that wa working in admission .,education
the but but i would say the biggest seed change that i saw happened .,education
in the way that enrollment management needed the function and the way that family made their decision happened during the two thousand and eight recession .,education
it wasnt a huge recession but if you remember it put a spotlight on on student debt and it put a spotlight on the cost of higher education .,education
because of student debt it is one of the thing that made me think that our rap wa one of the best idea since life spread and when i heard about that i said thats exactly .,education
the way we ought to be tackling this is you because much of the information thats out there in the medium is .,education
hiked up it is not the way thing are and people fear student debt much more than they ought to .,education
but that had a profound effect on me at trinity and it had a profound effect on a lot of especially small private college .,education
and it wa a big issue that i think thats the biggest challenge in the biggest seed change that i saw that you are two thousand and eleven made a difference .,education
there were some other thing that happened but thats the one that stuck with me a a a big change .,education
and you did not know in the head i vividly remember that and how that became part of the national rhetoric of whats discussed and is the cost of college out of control .,education
and thats obviously something that we are passionate about but it is it that part hasnt gone away it seems every election cycle it it .,education
you talked about the birth rate that thats something that it seems in two thousand and twenty five we are we are going to be getting back there with this demographic apocalypse if you will .,education
a a you think back to your .,education
your career early on a a young professional and you think to these young professional it always seems .,education
the industry the career is constantly young thing the old regime if you will .,education
it is changed out every often what what would what advice would you give to younger professional now is a. hey here a yield time thats coming up this may be something that in your career that you may want to look look at or maybe .,education
proceed with caution type type situation .,education
yeah i think about that question a lot simply because of the mentoring and the coaching that ive done in the last several year and i am always thinking about they are going to be .,education
ask the me question but what do i want to volunteer to them based on my own experience in career i think about that what do i wish i had been exposed to .,education
or told or .,education
recommended to me when i wa when i wa starting out and and use the first what the pop into my mind and i think it took me a lot to learn this .,education
i think thats the reason why i am going to be a person of of the enrollment result a year institution is and and the way i put it is .,education
is when you are enrollment is up better than what everybody expected do not take all the credit .,education
because you are going to be tempted to you are going to be tempted to accept all of those accolade that that the president and the board and faculty and everybody are going to want to say all you are doing such a great job be careful about .,education
about doing that because there are many other factor that affected that success rather than you and even you and your team and there a lot a and there many factor that it is .,education
and now the converse that is when it is down .,education
a whole lot le than what everybody expected do not take all the blame resistant and and yet early in my career i think i did both .,education
i i wa puffing my chest out when thinking we are looking good and then i am thinking the world is falling apart .,education
i am the one to blame if the enrollment is down .,education
and while there might be piece of that that we need to accept the responsibility and even some of the credit when thing are up it is one small piece and thats the message that i think enrollment leader young enrollment leader need to discipline themselves .,education
to present that message they yeah thank you i appreciate that let go have lunch let have a pizza party whatever we want to do but let keep in mind here that this is not .,education
this is not solely because of u in how we recruited i think we did a great job do not get me wrong but there a whole lot of factor and then have that list of thing that you think went .,education
a opposed to simply absorbing all the credit and the same thing with the blame .,education
and i wa interested to see what it would say and it felt somebody got inside of me and looked at me and do all my secret about what would go through my mind and how i wa wired a person .,education
and i thought how valuable that is and for me to be able to communicate that to the people that i work next to or that work that work that report to me or that i report to .,education
i became such a valuable thing to me i wish i had known that earlier .,education
i think that could have helped me through some real rough spot early in my career and then i think i learned some about some blind spot that i had and i wish i had known them earlier .,education
blind spot that .,education
i do not have a blind spot about about seeking result .,education
i do not have a blind spot about process .,education
i know how what to do and how what the step are to get there .,education
some people have blind spot on those thing .,education
my blind spot is on how thing are going to affect people .,education
and i need people around me to keep reminding me about how people are affected by the decision i made by the action that i take .,education
and it is a understanding what my blind spot are .,education
and helping people understand what their blind spot are when they are early in their career because i think you can step in a lot if you do not understand .,education
it is related to that selfawareness thing .,education
and then the last thing ill mention because it is something i usually also include in my coaching is that .,education
you can not do it all and most of the people that end up in a leadership role in the role in our people whove been pretty successful at some level at something .,education
and and they believe they can do a lot of stuff and i would have been one of those people .,education
but you can not do it all and when are you going to learn to trust other people to do important thing .,education
that need to get done and and we call it delegation .,education
but often by what we mean by delegation is is giving them something to do and then giving him detailed instruction about how i would .,education
and and one of the lesson i needed to learn wa to trust people give them a goal and turn them loose and you can not do it .,education
you got it you got to be able to trust people to do to do good work and the more i learned that the more successful i wa .,education
and it is great advice and a youve you built team roger you are your own team that you had at your respective institution .,education
you worked with other other other organization other company other college to help them .,education
bill team what to that to that point and maybe that is the point but is there anything else you can see is common .,education
and then you want to give them a bit of a to put call that maybe a leader can try to avoid or maybe focus on to build the .,education
team that that to complex whatever goal they are trying to .,education
yeah what one basic thing is to understand that when you are in a leadership role thats whats were called to do .,education
i think what happens is people get from i am a prime example .,education
they thought hey here a guy that wa a pretty good coach .,education
he recruited pretty .,education
maybe he can run in the mission off a . because you have the technical expertise to do something doesnt mean that you can oversee people to do that thing that you were good .,education
and yet most people get promoted because of their technical ability and not with much of a regard for their ability to manage other people to lead other people to motivate other people a you say to build team .,education
but they are plopped into a leadership role and they and what they do not understand is because you are a good recruiter or a good salesperson doesnt necessarily mean that you can lead people to do that or manage people .,education
thats a whole different skill set hiring people but people thats one of the skill that it took me i am still not sure i am very good at it .,education
but i think one of the thing i appreciate and what you said is sometimes you you are not sure you still figure it out ?,education
i think thats critical for u a human and u a leader to realize that we are not perfect and i think thereve been time at least in my career i thought yeah i got to ive got to figure it out ?,education
and and quite frankly thats when i started to fail thats when thing started to not go when i started limiting my personal growth my professional growth because i i thought i hadnt figured out .,education
in in that in that vein roger is there anything that any book or any resource that you may recommend to folk who are maybe starting out in that leadership role that helped help them blossom if you will .,education
yeah i got ton of .,education
i i tell you the three the three that i probably recommend the most i am a huge stephen covey fan .,education
even today even even in thing being a grandparent there thing that that are there a lot of wisdom in those seven habit of highly if if there are people out there never read that book i recommend it to almost everybody that i coach .,education
and then i am a big fan of drucker peter drucker and anything that drucker ha written i think he got he ha tremendous handle on managing people and and a lot of the principle that .,education
that i spout i guess would be the word is come from drucker i pulled him quite a bit .,education
and then the third one and this one wa later in my career but a book called leading change .,education
and i it .,education
and trying to remember the author name embarrassed that i can not but the title of the book is leading change because ive recommended it often those are three that ive been pretty commonly recommended .,education
thats the .,education
ive got to be a little bit better .,education
i think it is done .,education
thank you for that .,education
you mentioned earlier to about the self awareness piece now i think this go a little bit with something thats resonated with me a ive gone around and visited with with team and and you talked about .,education
or at least alluded to that burnout that .,education
and took some time away and miraculously it it healed with nothing and it wa the stress and it is amazing how stress will manifest itself in in your body .,education
physical body and is there is anything you could suggest in term of .,education
the mental health perspective for the young the the young and say they say out there that are that are that are new to this career field and making sure that they do not they do not burn out to early .,education
i told you a in this mentoring program this leadership program it is absolutely by far the most asked question is how how do i establish .,education
i work life balance that i am because i feel i am going to burn out if i keep it up at this pace and if i keep .,education
i am responding to the stress the way i am responding to the stress now every almost everybody ive ever coached or mentored .,education
in enrollment management ha asked that question at some level in some way and i there are no there are not a magic answer probably the most common thing and usually i try to get to know the personal life better before i give it .,education
in that end up in those leadership role and we we are we are motivated we keep grinding and do not even realize what we are doing to our body or to our mind and and that we are burning out until it is maybe too late .,education
but number one be conscious of it and by being conscious of it you can then intentionally set some goal for how much time have i got to spend with my spouse or my .,education
significant other or my kid or whatever how much set some goal about limiting certain .,education
a amount of work or making sure that you do certain thing that you enjoy doing that are going to relax you .,education
disciplining yourself to take vacation time even when .,education
it might be a difficult thing to do knowing what you are going to think when you get back and all of that but this point setting goal that are geared toward .,education
taking care of yourself in fact one of those seven habit that i wa talking about this team and cubby .,education
he talk about sharpening the saw he said think of yourself a a tool and how that tool is only effective .,education
if it is a saw it is only effective in sharpening if you do not take the time to stop and sharpen that saw .,education
work your tail off and not ever get anything done and thats what we end up going with our with our with in our leadership role we work crazy and do not realize why we are not getting it maybe it is because the saw got .,education
and and you need to keep it sharp and and that work life balance a part of that when we think we are going to for fit result .,education
if we take time off and relax and we take care of ourselves .,education
yeah i love that analogy and the sharpening of the fall for me personally a lot of that wa taking a week away doing some professional development going to a conference maybe getting a new new idea and in some way .,education
ive been to to a large extent we i think a lot of folk have tried their hardest to do conference virtually and i certainly miss the face of face conference and i think it .,education
to an extent we do not get the gatherer professional and talk about the challenge that we are facing in higher ed switching gear a little bit here but what do a some of the challenge that are being faced and in higher ed .,education
and i follow up to that question what is leader in higher ed can we do to help overcome those .,education
yeah i make the secret fault roger .,education
yeah i am yeah i get asked question about what what should be done after i retired the whole thing about .,education
what wa it where where .,education
there some thing that have come up since i wa in the field that i got i am an outsider thinking it through my own logic and then the pandemic came and i never had to go through a. when i would .,education
and role management i have to sit down and sort out .,education
i do not know that i have answer but i tell you one that hasnt changed is an old man especially for for small private college that is you talk about challenge that .,education
small private college are facing in and some of the larger room a is is enrollment whether it is because thats how your institution is funded your tuition ribbon and you are .,education
not getting enough student every year to make end meet or whether it is an access issue for for some larger .,education
institution that are necessarily doing it .,education
meeting the enrollment for for funding but enrollment is still a challenge is a challenge everywhere and it is .,education
the the challenge increased .,education
not because of covid but a we know that demographic cliff is coming in .,education
smaller private college have got to figure out how to compete for u piece of a smaller pie .,education
and and how do you get the same number of student if that guy is shrinking you are going to have to be getting student that other institution would have gotten before your competing .,education
and and some of them are already in a deficit mode and they set simply set the budget on what they need in order to balance their budget without any an idea is to how that might happen what change .,education
and we are talking about adaptive change earlier you get you got to make adaptive change in order for enrollment to .,education
to increase because if you keep doing the same thing the same way it is not always because your admission office are working smart or hard enough .,education
and but institution are going to set those budget and then enrollment people are going to be caught in that trap of .,education
and thats what the goal is but i honestly do not see any possible way that we could possibly but we are going to dig in and try and that whole cycle is still happening .,education
maybe happening more than ever because because of the chance enrollment is still one of the biggest challenge and i think itll continue to be .,education
i think for our senior we are thinking we will return it to the impact of different senior trust .,education
i think there .,education
make sense given my observation on college and university campus .,education
it is a little bit grandios but i think one of the challenge that higher education is facing now is the polarization thats occurring in our culture on social and political issue .,education
from an enrollment manager to standpoint where i take that is are we going to end up at some point ?,education
it used to be verboten for for me a an administrator to take a political position and and and preaches on my campus .,education
i wasnt supposed to do that .,education
we werent supposed to take a position politically or even on a lot of social issue a an institution .,education
thats what we are therefore we are there to have this type of discussion thats unbiased but now i am seeing institution who are putting a stake in the ground and saying we are this .,education
i do not know if it is that bad or not but ive heard other people talking about this being one of the thing that higher education is going to have to deal with and i do think it can affect enrollment management at some level .,education

it is been a wild ride but it is been gratifying .,education
and weve had an amazing time talking to everyone in our camp when weve been campaigning .,education
talking to our community i think ha been uplifting throughout all this .,education
i think we all underestimated a little bit of how much work go into the campaign while trying to manage your family while trying to manage work while trying to manage your own personal life .,education
but a dierger said it is been we are getting closer to the end here and a lot of the positive of the people weve met people weve met along the way people weve spoken with thing weve learned it is been it is been karen is through .,education
and by the way we have to give a big shout out to all the volunteer that have been helping u . absolutely .,education
theyve been all over the place .,education
theyve been canvassing for u . theyve been on the social .,education
theyve been helping u with merch with with with with punkards with flyer with whatever it may be .,education
this part is that part is easy .,education
they are making our part look easy with all this up yet .,education
there a lot of negative when you run for office because how time consuming is but the reward the rewarding aspect of it .,education
year from now youll look back and say it wa the volunteer that we met .,education
it wa a people along the way .,education
we met the issue that we addressed .,education
and yeah i certainly appreciate that because look you guy this is a volunteer work job if elected .,education
it is in a lot of way of stanclets .,education
in a lot of way people are going to say we are going to walk up to you to supermarket and walk up to you in town and they are going to say why can not you do this or that ?,education
stepping up to the plate is appreciated .,education
i guess my first question to you and then elie andres gon na ask all the other question .,education
thats how we roll around here on the selftax podcast .,education
what made you guy decide to run for office ?,education
thats the first place .,education
i need to go first. . when i first moved to maplewood i went to the board meeting all the time .,education
i do policy for a living .,education
i work for the government accountability office .,education
policy evaluation how to make government more efficient more effective work for the people is what i do .,education
i had what i studied .,education
and i thought this is the way i can give back locally .,education
when i went to the board meeting at that time they were still theyd go eleven twelve p.m. i had two little kid and i i couldnt take it on at that point in my life .,education
fast forward now my daughter last year wa the board of ed rep. and i had been following the board somewhat over the year but especially last year i followed it because she wa on the board .,education
and last year wa between the push to get rid of honor the the superintendent the that intense meeting in november the budget the cut to the art the cut to the teacher .,education
it wa a lot .,education
and i felt it felt to me a now or never moment in a way i think i know bimmels been feeling this way too .,education
it is what is going on ?,education
this doesnt reflect who our community is .,education
and i thought if it is now or never moment i have this skill set .,education
i have the time in my life now to serve .,education
let me try and help be part of the solution and get u back on track .,education
i the fact that you you follow any daughter footstep .,education
she love some big big foot to the end .,education
i would imagine shes mar i am not gon na come back to handle this .,education
but ill give them a hug .,education
i think for me a little bit similar in that ive got my kid entered the district during covid .,education
and they entered kindergarten and they were in preschool at the time .,education
and i think everybody wa forced to pay attention a little bit more to school .,education
what wa happening ?,education
whether it be on zoom or trying to do in person or some of the hybrid learning .,education
but a lot of the issue that were probably plaguing the district were coming to the forefront particularly with everything thats happening on the education side ?,education
and now you saw the fracture within the board of ed you saw the fracture with the leadership .,education
you saw the intentional distance that wa being put from the parent to the teacher .,education
something wasnt adding up .,education
and i think even if you a we got out of and dismounted covid parent that were involved did not rebound back .,education
they still stayed in a building .,education
you had to be a little bit more vigilant in term of whats happening .,education
i think a lot of these thing that youve taken for granted were no longer taken for granted .,education
and a a result i followed along a little bit more closer .,education
and the spirit to want to run probably happened with tony and jeffs run last year .,education
and i remember all of the thing that you said wow there an opportunity here to make some change .,education
they almost won .,education
they almost won .,education
and these guy they they were saying a lot of thing that we were thinking .,education
they were representing a lot of thing that represented what wa at stake .,education
some of the shortfall and the behavior and policy decision .,education
i went to a meeting agreed that where i i became a lot more interested in what they were saying .,education
and then who would have thought that that would have been ?,education
and when you are later but similar to what deerjer wa saying in term of where you are in your life .,education
and all this stuff is funny is we get into the end of this campaign run whether it is winner or lose .,education
and while we go through that journey we talked about i think a lot about now .,education
my mother wa a social worker .,education
and never paid attention to that a she wa an immigrant that came in and walked away from a lot of that life behind her .,education
but around this time my two older brother there wa one eight year old and the other is four year old in the me .,education
around the same age a that i am that now .,education
my brother started a nonprofit for overseas for african india an education and water water safety and water clean water .,education
my brother became chancellor of his alma mater .,education
and now here i am in the board of ed it is a it is a very uncorrected .,education
the very uncorred native unc communicated path that weve all ended up thinking about whats next in our life .,education
and this functional family calling .,education
it is an unintentional ?,education
it is an unintentional family .,education
and i will not reveal my age but i am starting .,education
but i am starting to think about whats next .,education
and i think this this board of ed run could be a signal of some thing that where i strongly believe in service .,education
and then service should be nothing thats shouldnt be short term of show is be a long term thing but what you need to step it at some point .,education
yeah and certainly ive told u before ive a friend of mine he in another township where there le focus on everything .,education
here we have a paparazzo and much to speak the village grain and and youve got the social medium site and everybody seems to know whats going on .,education
you have seven people running for office now .,education
he ran .,education
he and he said if id want to run for a board of ed he said ill run and he go congratulation .,education
yeah this town a little bit different .,education
yeah there a focus there a magnifying glass .,education
how are you finding that ?,education
are you finding your life is changed in a good way and in a not good way ?,education
you are thought on this one far and what youve experienced .,education
i think it is been on one hand .,education
i wasnt even on facebook before this campaign began .,education
in that sense ive been above the fray i think .,education
it is been some of whats been going on in facebooks been pretty disheartening at time in term of people saying thing about me that are certainly not true .,education
but when that happens i call them all or jeff and i say i am going to go out in canvas and it make me feel much better because i know the negativity that you might read .,education
it is a few people .,education
it is not and it doe not represent who we are in many by any mean .,education
and that it is been disheartening there but then when i go out and talk to people it is much the it lift me up much more .,education
it is been a little bit of a roller coaster in that regard .,education
but i wouldnt change it for anything because ive learned much from our community .,education
again i say this over and over .,education
it is it is awesome where we live .,education
we have many talented individual from all walk of life diversity by every definition of the word .,education
and i feel this is such a special opportunity to try and get our district to match that .,education
i drive up my street and i see all these sign and i it is warm .,education
i wa telling me the other day i wa i do not go to south orange very often but today that i went i wa surprised to see how many of your lawn sign long street .,education
i turn around more and i am guy got south orange .,education
it is a purple river .,education
yeah i wa a purple river .,education
how did you guy can not miss all those people ?,education
i am they are stepping it up here .,education
thats true .,education
yeah you what ?,education
one thing is hey ill take you alongside but they have to note it take you alongside .,education
that took the volunteer and yourselves and coordinating people to come out and say hey we got you back .,education
thats a i want to be a heck of a challenge .,education
it wa a challenge for sure but it wa one that we signed up for ?,education
and i think much of this wa knocking on door old school stud ?,education
we knocked on many door where somebody said i lived here for twelve twenty year and no one ever knocked on my door .,education
but for the board of ed i think theyve appreciated that freshness and putting a name to the face not digital avatar thats out there with a putting some personality behind it .,education
and go back to your earlier question of what we went what we learned out of this stuff .,education
this town is wild .,education
thats what .,education
for not being a involved in the in knowing the board and knowing all the different all the different pocket of communication that are out there learning about all these group all these different constituent or different plot line and different thing that are happening .,education
it is you are you are binging this content all the time trying to figure out how do i navigate this stuff .,education
and again this is south orange sooma is a microcosm of whats happening on our national scale and this is a board of election scale think about whats the thing about all the misinformation thats out there on the national scale .,education
talk about misinformation and i want to touch on this briefly but i do not want to spend too much time on it .,education
michelle obama once said when they go low we go high i feel your opponent went low with a flyer that they wa in their name they claim or a run at least told me he learned a bit a i learned of it .,education
directed at that you are running mate .,education
i guess we could running mate i guess what we called a running mate .,education
there wa a group of former board of bath and it endorsed the and while we were in bethany and they signed it and i did not yeah there wa some thats kindly .,education
it go debunked clearly debunked and that wa wrong and it ha no place for anything that it thought on on that .,education
there a car crash on that .,education
yeah you are about to see it .,education
and i think for a deal and by the way she should come in next year is i think thats where we thought this is unfortunate .,education
i think the one thing that everybody should remember all your listener is that that original flyer wa submitted to one of the local one of the local trade happened to tap or village green whatever wa any got rejected .,education
it wasnt it wasnt fact checked .,education
it wasnt second sourced .,education
and and oppo comment or a quote they put it up .,education
it wa they got to meet .,education
it wa a they put it up and then they realized quickly that it wa reckless .,education
and then they put up on their own website they doubled down a second time .,education
it is a realizing this wa inappropriate and wrong and and and and and and and not sense they they doubled down .,education
but they are afraid that they might get sued and thats why they took it down .,education
it is it is hard to say .,education
but i think the journalist he said now put it on .,education
it said board of ed stuff .,education
ill take it and then he said and this is the tap into a fred .,education
i know fred .,education
i think fred said we read it .,education
he wa nah not for me .,education
and then when when we looked at a little bit further we also saw that it wa a sponsored post .,education
look i come from medium journalist .,education
again some thing that are there .,education
but look at the end of it here the message that wa there .,education
and i do not we do not need to recap it because once you deposit that stuff it is stuff and people brain it stay there .,education
but this is a volunteer position .,education
you mentioned it is a fanceless position .,education
it is a volunteer position .,education
we are doing this for all the reason .,education
when you make insinuation that you put somebody career you put somebody family you put their friend you put a lot of thing at jeopardy .,education
at what cost doe winning mean to do that ?,education
i do think they even thought about that .,education
it wa they wanted to destruction fall .,education
i do not care what we are taking .,education
it is we are destroying it .,education
how do you feel brown is about this ?,education
i think that wa probably the lowest point of our campaign .,education
i feel bimmel said to blatantly put something out there that completely is misleading not the truth and can be life destroying .,education
wa it wa unbelievable because again i do not think it represents who we are a a community .,education
and i do not think it represents who we want a leader in our district either .,education
i think yeah i wa ambivalent to the whole process .,education
but when something that you are not them .,education
yeah that wa my thought .,education
not them .,education
if thats what they are going to do that doesnt work .,education
and i think that the back left backlash wa swift. . i think you saw you saw the community around me .,education
yeah everybody wa a line .,education
a rubicon wa crossed .,education
and now there no going back to that .,education
and are you surprised that having apologized to jeff about this ?,education
i thought they would put out a statement and say look i am sorry whatever .,education
we did not mean to go that far .,education
yeah i think they are could have been from both side because i do not know i do not know but i do not know i do not know i do not know .,education
but i think they were one of our own and nothing they havent apologized yeah .,education
they havent said we have nothing to do with this it feel they are supporting this .,education
which is disappointing .,education
sometimes you get to foreign tree .,education
have something to do with it .,education
thats yeah yeah yeah my number .,education
but i think hopefully do time theyll say wow .,education
and it is weak .,education
and it is weak .,education
we also at the debate the second debate we gave them a chance to denounce it and they did not take it .,education
now that wa a good opportunity to say something .,education
but moving forward if you get on the board when you get on the board whats the first thing you want to do ?,education
what did you want to do ?,education
what did you want ?,education
first thing you have to hand out .,education
whats the first thing you are going to do ?,education
that first thing if you could affect change immediately .,education
what would that be ?,education
the bargently .,education
the first bargently .,education
yeah i think the budget is number one .,education
you want to see the detail ?,education
what exactly are there spending money ?,education
if you do not have a sound budget if you do not have a budget that think over the year you you can not do anything .,education
and we have many issue .,education
we have to make progress on these equity recommendation .,education
there are special education department .,education
it is shocking how many story weve heard about how thats feeling many family and many student .,education
we can not and i think part of the budget also relates to the bossing situation because i think there is an opportunity there for some efficiency without changing the initiative without we support the intentional integration initiative and the rebalancing but we think we can do it smarter .,education
thats related to the budget .,education
yeah i think one of the first thing that we would do is i think we try and get that spirit of collaboration going again .,education
i think wed want to bring the people that felt outside inside again bring the teacher closer bring the student closer bring the parent closer to be the listening vehicle for that stuff .,education
and i think part of the reason why i also dear to nir running is that you can only do much from the sideline .,education
and i think by getting into the board of edu we are dealing with a much perfect information a possible .,education
and i think itll be our duty to be a transparent a possible to the community and try and get to the spot where we can if decision were being made why were they being made why wa it communicated in a certain way ?,education
again it is easy to shake your fist from the sideline .,education
yeah weve all done that ?,education
but let if the other night can get in there we are making our promise that we want to be accountable .,education
we want to be transparent .,education
we want to open the line of communication .,education
and by the way thats not a board of edu that thing .,education
thats anything .,education
i think a possible you guy can try to make the board transparent because i know you guy are aware about this invoice about hiring an outside person for the guidance thing .,education
and apparently half of the board wasnt aware that this wa happening .,education
and they did not know about the invoice .,education
you think it is possible .,education
you guy can make that the mystery seconded in the way .,education
i think is that what you are the other way they found it wa because of an old bra someone made .,education
we fixed this .,education
there more transparent .,education
that doesnt look .,education
it seems it wa in eighty threezero five hundred pay to an outside consultant .,education
eighty threefive hundred dollar .,education
and i guess it wa divided into two .,education
it wa divided into two .,education
it wa secretive .,education
it wa not secretive .,education
some people whats your take on that ?,education
whats your feeling about that ?,education
thats why i am talking about transparency .,education
how can we fix this ?,education
i think that a i do think that mr. bing i think weve to give him some grace ?,education
this what did not run here .,education
i think the first part of this did not happen on his watch .,education
i think i appreciated the message that he sent out .,education
i think he is trying to be more transparent in his communication .,education
he trying to be more candid .,education
and in our community even when you are transparent and candid you are going to get you are going to get hate ?,education
but having a board that will support his transparency and be transparent with him and try and be honest with him and be with him and the board admitting to mistake .,education
i think thats one of the thing that i feel i noticed with this situation with the director of guidance it feel no one is admitting to mistake ?,education
and and and i do not have an ego .,education
we are trying to do the best that we can .,education
and thats .,education
perfect. . and also being accountable to ourselves a leader hopefully by doing that we can then create lead by example in a way that other board member will act similarly. . with your child in mind again your parent your kid are in the school system now .,education
this is power .,education
this is the biggest your child .,education
the most important party of life and you are trying to give not only them but all these kid better opportunity in a school system .,education
thats been .,education
and the news rather regularly over the last couple year i friend in national news i wa a a news producer for a long time jumping hey you are school and the news again .,education
and hearing this for year .,education
there there trouble and paradise .,education
and i think you you can start to correct that by emulating the behavior that you want to see ?,education
with mr. bing is trying to get ahead of it trying to he doing the best he can .,education
yeah i am sorry .,education
he get he get he your eloquently said he deserves some grace .,education
he deserves time to get there .,education
but the leadership that he trying to showcase the board should reflect that .,education
and it is a trickle down ?,education
everyone should behave model their behavior off of that .,education
it is to get it wrong .,education
it is to sometimes it is not to get it wrong .,education
thats what you look .,education
you could have got ahead of it a lot earlier .,education
and i am sure if you were to ask mr. bing now he would if he wa looking back he would get what we do not maybe we should have done x y and z instead of whatever it is .,education
but we do not .,education
we are agreed that they should have hired that person to do the guidance canceler and you are talking about the consultant .,education
the consultant i am sorry .,education
yeah did you agree with that ?,education
or you would have handled it a different way ?,education
i would i would not have let go of somebody in order to have that same person be replaced by a consultant unless there wa a wide derelection of duty or there wa something that wa there .,education
i do not think that doe not seem to be the case .,education
people believe it wa a waste of money .,education
that that money could have used for that person to got left .,education
they could have used that for his salary .,education
we still got left with a lot of kid not having the class that they wanted .,education
we see line around the block of kid trying to get into class and i am reading online that some kid still do not have the class necessary to get in the college .,education
and i am i am i do not know if the spanish class or what but there there class kid are not in .,education
who the beaten ?,education
thats thats a scary situation .,education
i think that dropped the bowl here .,education
who do we think ?,education
it is hard to know because some people in the board seem they claim to know that they knew about they said that they knew about this .,education
i i do not want to speculate .,education
but i do agree what we spent pretty much seventy five of this guy salary or on this consultant .,education
and we got nothing essentially in return .,education
and this wa i think the director of guidance salary one hundred and thirty seven or something .,education
thats a full year of work ?,education
thats not putting together a master schedule .,education
what id to do is look forward .,education
at the last board meeting they presented this idea of the principle doing the schedule with two parttime counselor helping him and then we are going to reimagine the director of guidance role .,education
and it feel maybe we need to pause and take a look at what do we need a a district in term of getting our master schedule together if we need mental health make how do we make that part of it ?,education
but we constantly it feel we are constantly putting on band aid .,education
and we think about band aid for one year at a time instead of thinking it through .,education
even this new a reimagine director of guidance the first year they are going to be funded with a grant that we got a oneyear grant .,education
then i am thinking to myself how are you going to fund the person beyond this first year ?,education
and maybe maybe those question are being asked behind closed door but our trust is solo ?,education
the parent trust is low the teacher trust is low the student trust are low .,education
at this point we are at a place where we need to overcommunicate ?,education
that these people do not fill in the gap on facebook with false information .,education
i think thats where we want to try and come in is overcommunicating away and help the super overcommunicate .,education
and by the way it is not always misinformation ?,education
sometimes you need the citizen to fill in the gap correctly ?,education
i think weve got some very tenacious board watcher and people who care about the community that are trying to do the thing when they do not see it being done on the other end of it ?,education
it is not misinformation .,education
you need those warrior that are out there trying to dig through the garbage can and figure out whats going on ?,education
and thats and thats thats important .,education
yeah what if we hadnt what if someone hadnt oprah then for me ?,education
shatsin thats .,education
what would have happened ?,education
it is thats .,education
thats thats someone ive got to the effort of of finding what wa going on here .,education
it wasnt again and we were talking about transparency and thing of that nature .,education
this wa the not transparent .,education
we do not know who dropped the ball who hired that person .,education
you do not know yet ?,education
i think it is hard to know from where dear to an ir ?,education
yeah you guy would have that would be the the four of u together are now i am not going to know a much a what we are in there .,education
thats why we want to get in there to understand what went into the decision making and how we got to where we are .,education
and and by the way dear to and i talk about this a lot with jeff a is that some of these thing that we are talking about are basic .,education
a schedule ha been happening at the high school level at the school level for decade .,education
and i do not understand why that ha to be something that need to be reimagined or rethought .,education
these are i do not know .,education
doe seem to be basic table stake that we should be able to do with the a they are .,education
you guy find out who wa the plan .,education
well come .,education
well come .,education
there wa a call .,education
we are going to take a quick break here .,education

and we are back on the somatox podcast .,education
we are having great conversation .,education
all yeah .,education
yeah i am having the time in my life with deirdre brown .,education
hey it is our first candidate coming to our podcast final .,education
yes we do have candidate finally willing to sit down with u for these hard hitting question eliana .,education
i think you and i are the next sixty minute perhaps they are when they are coming up next on sixty minute .,education
i am working on a lot of these question .,education
when you guy were candidate did you guy see any other annex chair ?,education
well save that for the next summer talk podcast .,education
thats for a specific to the election .,education
thats a grated summer talk podcast ?,education
the afterhour summer talk podcast .,education
yeah i did see that .,education
how am i going to ?,education
but we wanted to talk about eliana .,education
you had a question about the teacher .,education
yeah yeah ive been to a couple of debate and it seems teacher thing is not talked about .,education
i know that now teacher are not very happy .,education
they are not even comfortable .,education
they do not know where they are going .,education
i am sure most of them are thinking of leaving .,education
there no .,education
there no .,education
there no .,education
what are they ?,education
what are they losing teacher ?,education
good teacher .,education
we are losing teacher around happy .,education
weve had rosio lopez on who the teacher union president and she say the morale is not high now .,education
the morale and now with this contract that it is not going on .,education
contribute their past it seems to be hey they be those better opportunity and other district and teacher who have the skill and the experience our head and the other district .,education
what are your thought on all that ?,education
i think we are in almost no member now ?,education
and the fact that a contract negotiation ha dragged out this long is it is almost an almost untenable .,education
in any negotiation weve said it before on the trail is that it shouldnt be something where either side is far away in their demand that it is going to take a long time to get to the middle .,education
you know where it is going to go ?,education
and i think what could have happened here in the beginning is we all know the teacher deserve a contract .,education
we all know they deserve a race .,education
we all know that we need to repreciate the teacher .,education
i do not think these thing are given and they are understood .,education
if you go into that in a negotiation you can get to the spot fast .,education
and it shouldnt become antiagnistic .,education
nor should you be using your social medium your own social medium or the public to use a negotiating leverage .,education
these are tactic that will pin each other pin people against each other .,education
and you lose sight of what you are trying to get done .,education
thats an unfortunate thing .,education
but i think for deer droneye over the campaign of getting to talk to a lot of the teacher .,education
we have .,education
weve been fortunate with that .,education
weve ... whats their feeling ?,education
what did you get from them ?,education
they are unhappy .,education
weve met with some certain certain folk in the called and we are and and yeah i think there is a overarching low morale in the sense of not being listened to or brought to the table or being even appreciated and supported .,education
one of the one of the thing that we learned and deer droneye a about this is that they hadnt been brought into any policy decision since two thousand and twenty .,education
these teacher are on the front line of most of the decision that get made from the administration and the district .,education
and there should be ample time and opportunity to bring them in on the upfront or get a chance for their feedback .,education
that is one of the first thing that we should try and correct ?,education
thats the football player coming off the field and you are not saying whats going on out there ?,education
what happened ?,education
you are a he is .,education
thats you asked the people that are in the that are in the mr. the battle in the middle of it .,education
and they are thats his two thousand and twenty .,education
thats thats thats amazing .,education
they feel they are blind .,education
they do not even know whats going on on the appreciate .,education
and yeah .,education
and i think weve already learned much and i would imagine well learn much more when on the board if we try and bring and bring the teacher in to talk about policy idea we have monitoring how policy are going .,education
they they gave u a lot of feedback about their experience with the intentional integration initiative .,education
thats a good thing .,education
better than them. . exactly .,education
when we had that question about meal for child and then them not getting their meal because they were moved to different school the teacher had talked to u about that before .,education
that question at the debate .,education
the breakfast .,education
yeah that they used to have in said four of them now that they changed to another school they do not get the breakfast .,education
and and little this is a very small example .,education
but one teacher wa talking about in their room the construction worker hung the hook up high and close together .,education
a the child can not reach them and b you are going to be spreading life. ?,education
and thats a very very small example .,education
but i think with the intentional integration initiative kid not getting meal kid not getting the special education support that should have followed them .,education
these are the thing that the teacher see every day .,education
and we should be absolutely tapping into their expertise and their experience .,education
and i think another part of going back to the teacher inpass is because our budget ha not been transparent for long .,education
we used to do more reporting publicly prior to two thousand and twenty than weve been doing under burnside .,education
i think there this also it go back to lack of trust .,education
because they do not necessarily believe that the district doesnt have the money .,education
no one know ?,education
where are the money ?,education
yes i have the community i believe we have the money and the other half of the money .,education
we do not have the money .,education
a lot of teacher they have the money .,education
and they are holding into it .,education
what are your thought about that ?,education
you can not blame them for their logic ?,education
play it out .,education
say there a there a budget shortfall .,education
you have the the reduction in force .,education
you talk about supply being cut teacher being cut power professional being cut director of guidance being cut .,education
but yet we can find 83k for a consultant .,education
and you do not have a contract yet and you are worried about where the money is going or where it is coming from .,education
of course the teacher are going to make the money .,education
and they are higher the power a a gun and they are higher the power a a gun .,education
again those thing that you can not of course you can draw a line through that stuff and you can not you can not fall for the logic of wondering is there something there ?,education
and again communication knowing whats if you have an opaque budget process for the last few year you are you are going to be you are only dealing with the information thats being handed to you and then otherwise you are digging for it .,education
a little shout out to marshall school and the teacher there .,education
i am friendly with quite a few of them .,education
these are two candidate now that have you back .,education
hey shout out to marshall and we have marshall shout out to marshall and we have marshall and we have marshall but thats specifically marshall .,education
these are concern that they have .,education
i think you well have their own concern .,education
yeah and ill ill add my daughter ha had some i am my both my kid have had some amazing teacher but at the high school and i am i am worried that my son who an eighth grader will not have have those teacher .,education
i think thats how how low it is feeling now .,education
yeah yeah this look the the i am willing to take if i wa to have a unofficial polling of of resident in south orange maplewood i guarantee you a lot of parent would be able to name most of their teacher growing up .,education
and i would guarantee you that they could not name hat and you have a many of their boss after they had graduated .,education
thats true .,education
thats true .,education
this we all know that teacher are leaf such a high impression a to shaping of who you are what you want to be how to behave .,education
they after the parent they are the the the people that are seen and on the front line of what your child is going through in shape .,education
and they are tattoo in your memory ?,education
of your life .,education
you have to try to remember the last ten world series winner .,education
you can not do it but you can not remember the top ten teacher .,education
yeah you could list it probably real quickly .,education
i know i can not mr. hunt top of the list you miss colbert .,education
mr. hunt hey hey .,education
i am keeping i am not on facebook a much and stuff .,education
i would be more because of the campaign .,education
but the only person i wa seeing touch after all these year more than some of my high school friend wa my art teacher for my school .,education
and that thats something to be said .,education
thats again i am not gon na date myself too .,education
and thats almost thirty year later .,education
and you are still in touch .,education
you should call mr. and on .,education
it is always a a parent a quick tangent i always feel very weird when i meet my kid teacher and try and call them by their first name .,education
yeah it is a new one .,education
i want to be yeah .,education
i am the selfadmisturizing .,education
how are you doing ?,education
it is not the ethical .,education
you call them first name ?,education
i go and miss it .,education
i go and miss your miss .,education
it is the end of the game .,education
thats funny .,education
i am doing a special book called the bull .,education
you are a teacher .,education
you are that your title mr. yes yes .,education
unless it is doctor .,education
but thats usually it is in the college level ?,education
all of a sudden but i am a school district and the parent always refer to me a mrs. castellia .,education
they never do my first name .,education
i guess the question is mrs. castellia .,education
it is respect .,education
if they are probably not my fouryearold i can not go to the school .,education
i feel wrong when they do the mrs. castellia .,education
she wa why do not you call me man ?,education
because you were forty year older than her .,education
but she did not that .,education
i shouldnt have told that .,education
but getting back to what we are talking about .,education
and i hope i am not throwing a curveball at you .,education
the the the the you were again by your opponent .,education
it seemed they said something about you not having frank sanchez a back during that whole mess .,education
and that wasnt true .,education
much sharing a little bit about that whole situation .,education
you were a friend of frank .,education
we are all in term of purpose .,education
a many of u in the community .,education
i am friend with frank and i am a friend of frank. . how you talk to frank ?,education
mr. sanchez ha been great with my daughter in the high school .,education
they have such a wonderful relationship especially because if they are working together when she wa on the board .,education
but regardless of that if you are here in the high school mr. sanchez there wa not an event that you went to that he wa not he is not there whether it is martin luther martin luther king day celebration a football game a chorus concert .,education
he is our high school biggest cheerleader in fan .,education
and i think he ha brought this sense of community and pride that ha been lacking .,education
and he seems to be able to relate to many of the student .,education
he when when what happened last year happened i wa i wa extremely upset .,education
it wa i think he wa his treatment wa terrible by our district .,education
and i wa a big friend of frank .,education
i went to the rally .,education
i posted and asked other people to donate .,education
certainly when i wrote about that and said i guess i said i wa a proponent of friend of frank .,education
and i think verbally i said i wa a supporter .,education
i wa there .,education
i meant i wa a huge supporter of that initiative .,education
i am very appreciative of the people who started that initiative .,education
and you were responsible i made the group .,education
but you were on support .,education
you were there .,education
when he got retired i am sure you have the many others in the community .,education
you had your fist pumped in the air. . and i think i certainly it is me saying i am a huge supporter of kamala harris. . i do not think anyone assumes that i am meaning i am running kamala harris campaign. . where you are done ?,education
thats how i viewed it .,education
that might be easier by the way. . and then running before the bad end i am about to run .,education
but no i did not intend for it to come across that way .,education
and i am appreciative to those people because that wa a that wa a great campaign .,education
i think it showed the community support .,education
and much of our community love mr. sanchez .,education
and what he done for the high school .,education
he back .,education
and i think you were a big part of that .,education
thank you for supporting him .,education
the kid love him parent love him .,education
not everybody .,education
everybody i speak to speaks to the world of them .,education
very few people ive met have anything negative say but i am going back to you guy .,education
because he got his job back .,education
got to get to your job .,education
is there anything that seen hall today .,education
i am telling myself i am asking a good question .,education
see hall prepped today had an incident .,education
it wa it wa a lockdown .,education
i am not exactly sure about the specific but obviously it wa very frightening for the child .,education
it turned out to be the police were nothing happened not quid .,education
security a big concern with our school system too with our school .,education
what do you thought on security ?,education
are we secure enough ?,education
do we need more security ?,education
how do we protect these kid ?,education
it is a dangerous world today .,education
and this this is a question brought up last night by a student at the debate .,education
and today i had a i had a friend text me saying is everything at the school maplewood school .,education
and i i immediately i wa shaking .,education
i thought it wa the columbia high school then i found out it wa seen hall but i wa shaking .,education
weve many people in our community their kid go to school there .,education
yes thats true .,education
it brought it home .,education
for the past three year the student board representative have brought up security a a number one issue to our board of education and to the superintendent .,education
many time and still we still we still are not taking it a a i think we need to .,education
last year there were kid that came into the school .,education
we had a kid come into the school a week or two ago .,education
a a member of the board i hope that i would love to work with mr. valice .,education
i think he the head of our security .,education
i am sure he ha got wonderful idea on what more we can do .,education
i think itll involve having security guard that are trained possibly thinking about what are those security guard paid ?,education
certainly they should be paid in the amount commensurate with the importance of the job .,education
we need standard operating procedure and we need expectation .,education
i think i am not sure what the high school is where kid are now but last year kid were expected to wear their idea but i do not think that wa an expectation .,education
kid did not wear their idea .,education
and if no one wearing idea you do not know who is should be in the building in who shouldnt be .,education
and i do not know where that is today hopefully it is better but security i do think need to be taken .,education
yeah and i think it is one of those unfortunate reality that we are in now .,education
and everything that weve heard far and what happened at ceten hall obviously thankfully nothing serious happened but protocol were followed .,education
it sound the student knew exactly what they needed to do .,education
again unfortunately that ha to be a routine that they need to practice but the student knew what they had to do .,education
protocol were in place the police responded accordingly .,education
that there an upside in term of at least that there wa something in term of something might have worked .,education
god forbid that wa going to be a grim reality .,education
again it still stink that this is the one that we have to live in .,education
it is always heartbreaking when number outside the window and why that ha to be the case now which is also unfortunate .,education
but we are a lot of these security thing for me having two kid in elementary school .,education
it is a bit new of hearing a lot of this stuff because when i go john my kid thats south mountain it look pretty secure .,education
it look thats the thing .,education
but again i who know who happens at the high school level when you have when you have and they should they should have mobility .,education
the kid should be able to room free .,education
they should be able to do the thing that they need to do a teenager ?,education
we all remember what it wa growing up in .,education
i know lady you said that you went through the window .,education
i said that when yes it is a climate of second the english class wa second floor .,education
you could jump out and it wa bush there .,education
and we used to do all the time .,education
i could say we have to jump up .,education
i could say with confidence at least two of u in this room have done that .,education
and then youd have to go around .,education
that wa you have to go through the door and help the principal .,education
but now you wouldnt get in quickly .,education
did you have your help from a jew then ?,education
the jew from the jew .,education
i used to have a jew from which is jewish curly hair .,education
and she called whats you called from ?,education
ive heard from you .,education
but anyway it wa yeah a you could see it is long gone .,education
yes but back in the day i had a wonderful head of hair .,education
i do not think anybody ha to worry about shooting in every now .,education
well go in and out and that .,education
no you never never crushed your mother .,education
the good old day .,education
but we were young and beautiful .,education
it is hard to be a kid now that it wa a weird one .,education
even the id i know the kid have the with the id is my kid when he left for school he twenty five now .,education
but i i wa if your head wasnt attached to your shoulder you forget that too .,education
he would forget his book bag .,education
hed forget the homework .,education
he would my daughter .,education
two sneaker .,education
those are not matching sneaker .,education
and now you are asking to bring an id also .,education
it i understand the issue but you will put in the burden on kid to put it on .,education
but you are going to want that .,education
the idea they have to be vigilant .,education
they have to have their they had on a swivel .,education
they have to understand all these thing .,education
why can they leave the id at school ?,education
because in the school district where i work the teacher collect them when they are leaving .,education
they collect the idea when they come back and they give it to them .,education
that way it doesnt get lost .,education
maybe they should do that .,education
you perhaps my daughter many time i have to drive the id to my daughter because they will not let her go .,education
and i guess it is a time consuming situation especially without having to what how many kid are in the columbia ?,education
i got the thousand three time .,education
it is a little city ?,education
and also it is take a lot of time to .,education
i think we need to it is many thing in our district .,education
take a step back and look at what we are doing .,education
what are other district doing and doing ?,education
and how do we copy that ?,education
and the id maybe that is i do not know .,education
maybe that is a good way to do it .,education
yeah they collect them .,education
but what is is whats your message to the thousand of family in the community ?,education
and many of them maybe private school maybe maybe this is not working .,education
whats your message moving forward to these parent that i said maybe i get to get my kid out of the school system ?,education
what would you say to them if they you are not going to door and i said i think i am taking my kid out .,education
what do you think i should ?,education
i know there many of them in seeding seed and prep a lot .,education
i think thats why we are running .,education
in a way i think we see that .,education
weve felt it in some way ourselves .,education
why can not why is our district not serving all of our kid ?,education
our community awesome .,education
theyve sent their kid to private school .,education
they do not want to move because they love our community .,education
but it is a shame that you are paying for these tax and you do not feel you are your school can serve your child .,education
and for u it is help come on board with u . we are parent .,education
we are the voice of parent .,education
we can bring that to the board .,education
and it is about level setting in a way .,education
it is level setting the temperament of the board working with the superintendent .,education
and then getting back to basic the bushing the budgeting scheduling guidance .,education
these are thing that are very every school district ha to do on an annual basis .,education
and we seem to be faltering with it in recent year .,education
and i think if we can get those thing on track .,education
and by the way we need to get those thing on track because we havent .,education
we do have these important equity recommendation .,education
we have these important special education recommendation .,education
we have to rebuild our art program .,education
we have to be able to provide athletic facility for all of our student .,education
this is part of being a school district .,education
and for u it is let recenter .,education
it feel in recent year we to throw thing on the wall and see if they work .,education
and we do not think them through .,education
we do not think them through one more planning .,education
and we do not think through every single ramification of them .,education
and i i think for u well bring that temperament of let bring people in .,education
let think of idea .,education
and let workshop these idea all the way through before we start to implement them .,education
and then when we implement them let make sure the teacher are prepared to implement them .,education
let make sure the administration prepare to implement them .,education
and then a we are implementing them let use data to see what are our goal .,education
are we making progress ?,education
these are thing that you do when you are implementing policy .,education
it is not it is not rocket science but it seems weve struggled with that in recent year .,education
and i and i if we can do that i truly believe we have we have such a wonderful community .,education
we have a chance at a new beginning with a new superintendent .,education
it feel with the leadership behind him which is thoughtful which is accountable transparent bringing together the people that have been felt the parent the teacher the student that have been left out on the sideline .,education
it feel we we can get back on track .,education
and we can not serve all of our student .,education
yeah i think when the what we owe it to ourselves to have the district match the community ?,education
it is what we all talked about .,education
it is what we all strive for .,education
and if we can get those basic then let it be a decision what they make is for their kid .,education
because by the way not every kid is built for public school .,education
sometimes it might make sense to go to boarding school or private school whatever it is that they had that access they had that choice to do .,education
fine but let not make it because there no other option because theyve given up on the public school system .,education
when you give up on the public school system it is a downward spiral for everything .,education
and it is hard to get out of that ?,education
this is a spot now and due to set it perfectly with everything that we are talking about in term of our campaign .,education
this is that moment ?,education
we are at an inflection point .,education
you hear that a lot at the federal level at the nation level and all that stuff but it is in our town .,education
this is a critical critical moment in term of where we decide to be a a district .,education
the stake are high .,education
the voter have a choice .,education
they know the thing are important for them .,education
and we have to reflect that .,education
and you can not do it by having division .,education
you can not do it by divisiveness ?,education
i think the community is ready .,education
there we are playing i am telling you there a lot of the i do not have the drama i do not have the transparency .,education
and the negative the negativity the negativity not that is it i read someone and post online they should all go and have a clean slate with nine and the fresh people .,education
if you can close your eye and think for a moment what the district should look youll quickly find out that it is worth saving it is worth fighting for and it is worth voting for .,education
yeah we have a choice and it is not when we talk about that putting your stomach that we said at the top ?,education
we all got that a little bit .,education
and the parent talked about that last night asked about the drama going on can you ?,education
and yeah the response wa a little weak ill be honest with you .,education
i wa hoping that someone not talking about you we talked about the others that are in the thing i wa hoping no we did not know more drama i wanted to feel that .,education
they are we are willing to do that .,education
because a lot of people feel the fortivist divided into you got the soldier warrior group and then you got the other group .,education
and then thats where the victory start because they have their own agenda and then there another agenda ?,education
id say look a agenda is thats a tough work ?,education
it wa when you came to help .,education
but what you did is they got their being influenced by the social group .,education
and a people that you think they are influenced and they are absolutely .,education
this politics this politics exactly .,education
on a local level which i think ha gotten a little out of control thats my take .,education
i do not know if we have it .,education
are you going to be those board of eight ?,education
you are going to call them out ?,education
thats not .,education
are you going to be that ?,education
are you going to be the quiet one ?,education
i am not going to touch that .,education
i am not putting you in this spot .,education
but some people to see that .,education
theyve been called out if they did not see it .,education
yeah i think look i think deer going to have the tone tenor temperament to have polite discord .,education
it doesnt mean putting somebody it doesnt mean talking at doesnt mean talking down to it doesnt mean negative body language .,education
it doesnt mean gaslighting or whatever behavior that we might see out there before .,education
but it is taking it head on and calling them out .,education
and by the way we would expect the same thing .,education
deer your own i and jeff would expect the same exact thing .,education
if we were saying something incorrect or behaving incorrectly you got to be able to .,education
what are you about you guy ?,education
you guy are very approachable .,education
even though i did not know you guy you guy did not have that cold front .,education
there a approachable compare to you .,education
because yeah they are .,education
yeah they are .,education
they are very lovely people .,education
people come and if you are basing in vote on them being lovely they are lovely but they are also a you can hear they know what they are talking about they are prepared they are ready to go .,education
i can vote for a candidate that ignores me or do not give me the minute to hear me out or anything .,education
i am sorry if you give me the wrong look and you pas by i am not giving you my vote .,education
but i have the most important question to me the night and many people are talking about it on the social medium site on the long side how did you decide whose name came first second and third ?,education

a theoretical order is not it ?,education

hello english learner welcome back to another podcast here with u at englishpod .,education
my name is marco .,education
and today we are bringing you another part of our sport series and this time it is an advanced lesson .,education
thats we are heading to the mountain today to take a skiing lesson .,education
alright we are going to be learning about skiing a winter sport and very popular throughout the world .,education
but before we get started why do not we take a look at a couple of word in vocabulary preview ?,education
vocabulary preview .,education
alright we are going to hear these two word in our dialogue .,education
the first one is fresh powder .,education
fresh powder .,education
fresh powder .,education
powder we probably know this phrase already .,education
yeah but here we are talking about fresh light snow .,education
fresh light snow snow that recently fell .,education
the best kind for skiing on .,education
the best kind .,education
alright fresh powder .,education
what about our next phrase ?,education
we are also going to meet a fourtime giant slalom champion .,education
alright a fourtime giant slalom champion .,education
giant slalom is a type of ski race .,education
when you probably see it on tv when they go down the hill and they have to go through these red or blue flag ?,education
now a fourtime giant slalom champion mean he won the giant slalom four times. . this is an interesting way of saying that somebody did something many times. . i can say the threetime nobel prize winner .,education
yes exactly. . or the fivetime olympic gold medalist .,education
now it is time for u to go to the mountain with our famous rick field and bob copeland and well see what happens .,education
welcome ski lover of all age .,education
my name is rick field and here with me is the man that need no introduction bob copeland .,education
thank you rick .,education
what a beautiful day here in aspen colorado where the sun is shining and weve got twelve inch of fresh powder .,education
it doesnt get much better than this .,education
thats bob but today we have a special treat for our viewer .,education
we are joined here by ian russey fourtime giant slalom champion .,education
and on this special edition of the show ian is going to teach u the basic of skiing .,education
let hit the slope .,education
first off let get those boot on .,education
you are going to want to make sure your boot fit snugly .,education
now snap them into your binding .,education
and you are also going to want a good pair of goggles to protect your eye .,education
it is a bright day today there going to be a lot of glare out there on the slope .,education
we do not want you hitting any of those mogul .,education
bob since you are a beginner skier and might take a few spill it is a good idea to have a good warm pair of dry ski glove .,education
easy there rick .,education
let head over onto the chairlift and test your skill .,education
all we are up here on the bunny hill .,education
bob why do not you do a few snow plow turn ?,education
gnarly run rick .,education
that wa sick .,education
you want to see gnarly ?,education
see that bump over there ?,education
i am going to catch some major air .,education
thanks for joining u here today .,education
i think that about doe it .,education
we are off to grab some freshies .,education
pretty embarrassing for rick there wasnt it ?,education
yeah he wa a little bit cocky .,education
and then he ended up falling .,education
i think there a lesson in that for all of u . but what the real lesson is today is language .,education
why do not we start with language takeaway ?,education
all on language takeaway today let take a look at the first word .,education
we have some binding .,education
binding are a lock that attache your boot to your ski .,education
those are the binding .,education
i guess it come from the verb to bind .,education
to tie something that it stay .,education
for example my binding are broken. . and another piece of skiing equipment and very important is goggles .,education
we have goggles now .,education
yep not to be confused with google .,education
it is spelled almost the same way ?,education
goggles are imagine a big pair of glass that you wear when you ski .,education
it make people look fly .,education
they have these huge glass .,education
and youll also see safety goggles which you might wear if you are a mechanic fixing a car or someone working with wood or chemical or what have you .,education
goggles protect your eye from snow from the sun from anything .,education
moving on to our next ski word .,education
they said you should wear the goggles that you do not accidentally go over the mogul .,education
it sound strange .,education
what are these thing ?,education
these are the bump that are in a ski hill .,education
they are mini little hill .,education
and they are very difficult to ski over ?,education
you got to be pretty good to handle those moguls. . and since these guy are beginner skier they are starting out on the bunny hill .,education
the bunny hill .,education
the bunny hill is the easiest hill .,education
it is where the beginner start to learn .,education
yeah all the kid .,education
all the kid are on the bunny hill .,education
and our final word .,education
we are going to look at two word here because they mean almost exactly the same thing .,education
we heard the ski instructor say gnarly .,education
yeah gnarly .,education
it is spelled gnarley .,education
and a related word sick .,education
now sick mean to be sick ?,education
let listen to some example to help u understand .,education
those were some sick dance move .,education
example two .,education
jack and i went to the beach yesterday and surf some gnarly wave .,education
example three .,education
man the concert last night wa sick .,education
i can not believe we got front row seat .,education
gnarly and sick they mean that it is amazing .,education
it wa cool .,education
these two word are very very informal .,education
both of these word i think originated with skier snowboarder skateboarder .,education
thats all the word we have for language take away but we have some great phrase that we want to take a look at before we listen to the dialogue again .,education
it is time now for fluency builder .,education
fluency builder .,education
all rick said that it is time to ... rick invited everyone to start skiing by saying let hit the slope .,education
to hit the slope .,education
to hit the slope .,education
now we want to hit the slope .,education
what doe that mean ?,education
let go to the mountain .,education
now we can change the noun slope for something else ?,education
yeah you can change it for a lot of other different noun .,education
and why do not we hear some example of how you can do that ?,education
i have to hit the book and study for my exam tomorrow .,education
example two .,education
i think i am going to hit the bed now .,education
example three .,education
honey can we hit the supermarket on our way home ?,education
great great example and now we understand how we can use the hit the something .,education
what about our next phrase ?,education
rick warned bob that he might take a few spill .,education
to take a spill .,education
to take a spill .,education
it mean a light fall or ... pretty dramatic fall .,education
for example instead of saying that little girl wa riding her bike and she fell i can say that little girl wa riding her bike and she took a bad spill .,education
yep. . to take a spill .,education
to use the verb take though .,education
yes exactly .,education
you can not spill. . you have to take a spill .,education
what about our next phrase ?,education
you might take a spill when you catch some major air. . catch some major air .,education
to catch some major air .,education
am i catching something ?,education
how am i catching air ?,education
thats impossible .,education
imagine if you are jumping and your ski are catching the air. . i am in the air for a very long time maybe ?,education
to catch some air it is you are flying for a couple second .,education
you are flying for a couple of second .,education

i got my good friend mr. andrew the mfg crow .,education
now let me tell you drew is a transformative figure in the manufacturing sector from his beginning a a teenage father and overcoming his past a a two time felon .,education
drew ha ascended to the forefront of the advanced manufacturing education movement .,education
he is the former lead professor at rankin technical college in st. louis where he spearheaded the development of a cutting edge digital curriculum in advanced manufacturing technology .,education
drew influence extends through the role a cohost of project mfg a program dedicated to elevating skilled trade across the u.s. through top tier competition recognized twice a aerospace and aviation man of the year and featured in forbes .,education
drew work address critical workforce and skill gap making him a key voice in shaping the future of manufacturing .,education
yo yo of the new american manufacturing renaissance .,education
whats going on man ?,education
whats up my man ?,education
yo i am excited to be here bro .,education
i do not even know if ive been a fan since you launched and ive been seeing all of the dope people that you had on here .,education
and i am glad that we can make some time to get able to sit down and chop it up and get on the episode bro .,education
respect man .,education
you are moving all across the country .,education
you are innovating .,education
you are bringing an important message across america that speaks to economic global mobility and listen man it is we are recording this in october which is manufacturing month .,education
i know you are busy on tour but i got some time for me please .,education
i am glad we were able to do it man .,education
and shout out manufacturing month shout out all the manufacturer that are listening to this podcast .,education
shout out to the people that did not know that it wa manufacturing month .,education
and now they do make sure that you get in tune with some activity that are going on next year .,education
it might be too late by the time you hear this podcast but now that it is on your radar and it is on your map locking with the manufacturer and community they want to show you some love every october .,education
one hundred percent man .,education
before we get too deep into into all of that man i want to know whats whats your origin story ?,education
i am from st. louis missouri and you alluded to on the intro man i wa a teenage father a two time felon .,education
and i wa in a position where my single mother wa working three or four job and we still couldnt pay the rent and keep the license on at the same time .,education
and at a young age that made a mental marking me to where i felt people shouldnt work and struggle at the same time .,education
there no way that you should have a job or multiple job and not be able to afford at least the bare necessity for people .,education
and a a young man from our area trying to figure this out i did not have a lot of positive role model or people that were looking to help me figure out what it wa that i wa good at .,education
and i wanted to help my mother at the same time .,education
i hopped off the porch early to speak .,education
and those thing led to making decision for now and not having a long term vision and a long term plan .,education
i found myself at eighteen with no real job prospect no real skill no understanding of what i could be .,education
and i had f some of my report card of life .,education
i have felony and amout of fee .,education
wa in that cycle of committing crime getting locked up getting back out missing court day having war running to different state doing different stuff .,education
then eventually i got tired and not tired for myself but i saw my son starting to mimic some of the thing that i wa doing .,education
and it left a bad taste in my mouth i decided that whatever it looked i did not know what i wanted to do ?,education
i did not know what i could do .,education
and sometimes thats enough .,education
knowing what you do not want to do can propel you towards the person that you can not be .,education
i knew on the inside i wa bigger than who i wa being now .,education
i knew that there wa a bigger picture in life for me .,education
i did not know what that looked but i knew i did not want to keep doing what i wa doing .,education
i put the word out that i am looking for a job .,education
it wa the height of the recession at the time .,education
it wa no job out here .,education
definitely no job for a teenager with no education and no skill that were transferable for anything .,education
if you remember at the time i remember people with master degree trying to get job at mcdonalds .,education
and it wa it wa tough .,education
the job market wa scarce .,education
plus it wa more scarce not having skill having all these thing going against me .,education
and someone wa look i can get you a gig or i can get you an interview .,education
it is not necessarily a guarantee for a job .,education
and i wa what is it ?,education
and they said it is a machinist .,education
and i wa i do not have no idea what that is .,education
but if it is paying and you can give me an interview thats all i need .,education
i need to talk to somebody across from me and i can get this job .,education
i go into this shop this warehouse looking thing i come in and they give me a test .,education
not an aptitude test but it had different measuring tool and instrument on there that they used to do the job .,education
and i failed that side of the test .,education
i did not have any idea what those tool were how to use them how to read the reading on there or anything .,education
on the backside of the test though there wa measurement a eighth three eighth a quarter saying it .,education
from my last job in the street i did on that side .,education
i knew all of that stuff .,education
i clowned on that side and he offered me a job on the saw ?,education
and in the saw situation wa taking raw material in the shop cutting it down to a specific size adding another one quarter of material on there and then taking it to the machine .,education
then the machine could be programmed to cut out whatever we are making out of the metal ?,education
and having that job gave me hope .,education
i might not know what i can be but this is something to hold on to .,education
i cut that metal it wa a million dollar of cut .,education
hey i know you are enjoying the episode quick .,education
drew ha something that he want to offer you for free .,education
drew tell him about it .,education
i want to find the next drew or the drew two.zero .,education
this is where you do it .,education
log on to drewcrowmfg.com .,education
click on ebooks and there two of them that you are going to get for free for listening to this episode .,education
if you are in the industry the mfg renaissance starter kit is for you .,education
if you are looking to get into the industry the mfg hustle blueprint is for you .,education
can i know those workbook and start your success today ?,education
back to the episode .,education
i started showing up and i saw these machine making they were taking a big piece of metal and they are cutting it down and making more money off of it .,education
and i wa in awe because again referring to my last job at the time we were adding to raw material and stretching it and trying to make money. . that wa the first thing that already had me my mind going .,education
the second thing wa how are these machine operating with nobody in front of them ?,education
and what are we making ?,education
and they told me that we were making noncontact bearing isolators that went into fighter jet .,education
and at that point i felt my job matter .,education
when i wake up every day i am a part of the bigger picture in america .,education
i got a part in keeping our country safe .,education
this wasnt too long after nineeleven .,education
patriotism wa big and growing up black sometimes america .,education
there a different america that you live in ?,education
we sometimes we struggle to find our place .,education
that got me in the game .,education
that got me excited about manufacturing and engineering and making thing out of raw material .,education
i showed that excitement and working and put my head down .,education
eventually they sent me to college to get bachelor and master degree in digital design and engineering .,education
i went to mit .,education
i worked for a lot of the biggest brand out here making everything from lamors big combine for john deere to stealth fighter jet for boeing different place that .,education
from there i got to teach .,education
people started hitting me up and saying hey man our industry is old .,education
we need some younger some new blood in here .,education
and we are not able to recruit and bring people in .,education
people forgot what we do .,education
we need a voice and we need a person that look what the kid are interested in now .,education
and we need to make manufacturing sexy again .,education
i wa able to get out here and build a platform and use my platform to show kid why we can make america make thing again and why we should be doing that .,education
thats such a powerful story .,education
i think you may have delivered one of the best origin story ive had on the .,education
i am thinking about i am thinking about one time someone mentioned their grandmother and it wa it got emotional .,education
but you took u on a beautiful journey of i am thinking about resilient .,education
and we talk a lot about the durable skill on the podcast the thing that i work for u are looking for .,education
and a you were talking i can not help but think about i put one word around that story is resilience .,education
i am curious to you for those who may be listening or want to share strategy around resilience can you speak to that a little bit man ?,education
absolutely man .,education
and i think to be honest at the time when i wa building up my resilience i wa too eager to know what i am saying ?,education
and it wa look i am going to get knocked down .,education
i know these thing might happen .,education
but a long a there a little bit of hope that i can stand back up and i can stand i am going to be .,education
or if i even got to get on my knee what i am saying ?,education
and eventually stand up i am going to be but nothing going to stop me from getting my getting myself to wherever i need to be or whatever goal that might be .,education
it might look different my pathway there .,education
it might everything is always going to be obstacle in life .,education
and once we understand that then we understand that it is another obstacle ?,education
it is not it is not definite .,education
it is not finite ?,education
that wa the mentality that i had .,education
and i did before i had that mentality .,education
i knew that i did not have any other choice .,education
it is either i kept going or i am going backwards .,education
and if i go backwards i wa already a rock bottom .,education
i am going to be locked up or i am going to get smoked .,education
to for lack of better word .,education
but a long a you do not continue the back slide then youll continue to stack wins. . and a you stack win you can look back and thats a testament to your resilience. . you start seeing that yo this did not take me out .,education
that did not take me down .,education
this did not stop me .,education
and once you start seeing thing that are familiar that you remind yourself yo that wa another thing i hopped over .,education
or you start getting that that vision in that foresight and you can start seeing these thing coming and you can hedge for those. . and you can say hey i know that these curveballs are going to come .,education
i am going to work on my curveball hitting. . and when the curveballs come you are smacking them out of the park .,education
or you can you could be able to see thats not my pitch to speak .,education
it is a journey .,education
it is something thats built a you are walking on the journey but you got to understand that the beauty is in the journey and not necessarily in wherever you think that finish line or that goal may be .,education
yeah respect .,education
thank you for thank you for sharing that .,education
and no doubt going in on it .,education
i wanted to ask you i had one other follow up question to that .,education
and doing a research the name of donnie ogil came up .,education
is that your mentor to help ?,education
speaking to .,education
donnie wa the person that gave me my first job .,education
talked about going into that shop and giving me the test .,education
and donnie wa an old white man from the stick ?,education
and him and i had nothing in common on the outside .,education
and when i went and sat down in that meeting or in that first interview i he i do not know how he did it or what he had in him to see in me .,education
potential i had in the fact that i needed this job whatever it wa going to be .,education
and that wa all i needed to hear .,education
a soon a he told me that there wa something else on the other end of this and that hell help me get there i knew that he believed in me .,education
that made me start believing in myself .,education
if he think i could be a machinist if he think i can program these machine i never i never even seen one of these thing in my life .,education
and i did not know what an engineer wa .,education
i did not know what 3d design cad cam any of these higher level concept were .,education
but he wa at a high level and looked down and saw something in me and knew that i could do it .,education
and sometimes thats all you need ?,education
you need someone to say hey i know that this is in you because ive been here .,education
and let me show you how to get here .,education
now i think thats powerful what you said .,education
sometimes when people may find themselves in situation where they are uncertain or lacking the confidence and you do you need someone to transfer their belief in you on to you no i see what is possible in you .,education
and i think thats thats powerful that it .,education
one thousand percent .,education
and he took it another level ?,education
that wa another thing that i think made me receive what he wa saying wa now only do i see it in you .,education
here clear step on how to start becoming the you that we both know that you can be. . by empowering me not mentorship but sponsorship .,education
hey we are going to pay for you to go to school .,education
we are going to do this this this and this .,education
now i feel he not .,education
this is not lip service .,education
they are helping me become because a lot of time you do not know what you do not know .,education
and we have the burden on the people to to realize their potential .,education
and they got no idea on even how to take the first step .,education
we tell people you could be all you could be .,education
how do how doe that work ?,education
what doe that look in action ? .,education
and that is one of the reason why i launched the new american manufacturing renaissance tour what i am saying ?,education
because i saw that while i wa working at ranking we had a lot of kid in the city of st. louis that were coming to take tour and they were being pushed to automotive ?,education
or they are being pushed to construction or thing that people know a lot about plumbing maybe ?,education
and i would go to these kid that were on these tour and theyd be yo what class do you teach ?,education
i want to come learn from you .,education
you do not look a professor ive ever seen before .,education
and i would bring them into my classroom .,education
i wa shoulder in the machine and these kid that were once interested in automotive working on other people car wa wait i can use these machine to design my own engine to make my own car .,education
i could be henry ford one hundred percent you can .,education
and once we understand the full picture and they know hey yeah you you are into car yes you could work on them .,education
you could work on all the car that somebody else made learn that thing inside and out and be a journeyman mechanic on your own shop one day .,education
thats noble .,education
you can do that .,education
or if you into that and you love car and you are into these thing not on that side of it but the design or you want to know the design you want to know these thing .,education
you could come be the next elon musk over here .,education
you could be tesla and design a vehicle that you you want to make the next flying vehicle .,education
thats whats on this side of it .,education
and if people do not know that they do not know how to go there .,education
this is you own it man .,education
you own you on fire you on fire .,education
break this down man .,education
what the new american manufacturing renaissance tour ?,education
i see you traveling the country spreading the message .,education
talk to me about the opportunity that are available that you are exposing student to .,education
one hundred percent .,education
i get into between twelve and fifteen city on this tour .,education
it is a selfheadline pretty much selffunded .,education
i do have sponsor in the manufacturing industry .,education
we always looking for more .,education
we go into city for two day apiece .,education
the first day we spend a full day with job seeker and student where well either come to a technical college or a high school with a roble cte program .,education
and it is set up a a rap concert for real .,education
we got smoke machine a light show all type of stuff to get the kid aware of and excited about career in advanced manufacturing .,education
i talk about my story all the dope thing that ive worked on .,education
the second day i bring industry and city leader out .,education
and at that mixer we do a recruiting and retention workshop .,education
you could say hey this is why it is important to not only showcase these 21st century career in your area but this is how you reach back to them and build a bridge from where you are now .,education
that mean internship apprenticeship volunteering robotics team or something that .,education
we start to build those bridge in these city that the ecosystem becomes selfsustained where academia can support community .,education
and then the city leader can support legislation that support both .,education
and then now weve got not only innovation but high paying job in these city core where they werent once a prevalent a they were .,education
give me give me a success story from one of the the tour where you saw a student mind blown or you saw some folk getting give job or something give me something .,education
one hundred percent .,education
most of the time we do in both of those thing ?,education
we want to bring the trade to the people face .,education
when you come to my tour you are going to walk into most likely an auditorium you are going to walk into dope music a light show .,education
i said kid screaming getting handout all type of stuff .,education
it is a high energy show .,education
outside of the auditorium you are going to have local business and technical college with admission counselor and people that are given apprenticeship there on the spot which is our technical college .,education
wsu tech which is called state university technical .,education
we were able to increase their enrollment in their summer cte program by two hundred percent .,education
we got thirty kid signed up for their dual enrollment program from west high school into the wsu tech program .,education
and a lot of time every city that we go to there always some type of scholarship or award given that that bridge is real .,education
and thats the thing that i think our community were missing .,education
people were coming into the community and saying hey you can do this you can be this they werent showing them how they werent showing them the tool needed to get there .,education
and then they werent empowering them to be able to do it .,education
thats the reason why i do not go to the community member and do the first show .,education
thats good .,education
we want to turn on the light bulb and get that mind thinking .,education
but then we want them to be able to connect and know exactly where to go. . thats wichita in in detroit .,education
and there another person that wa on my panel that doe 3d printing with all type of exotic material .,education
and they continue to probe the kid how would this help your community ?,education
what if you had this is a product you would need a sale department and this this and this .,education
that mean you could hire twenty five people from your community if this wa a product .,education
and at the end of that conversation they were invited to come into the lab they can do rd and begin to make these thing from what these kid idea was. . thats what we want to push .,education
thats what we want to promote .,education
you mentioned 3d printing .,education
i know there a big skill gap .,education
talk to me a little bit more about for our educator who may be listening what are some of the skill they should be focusing on a it relates to advanced manufacturing opportunity .,education
now there is a two.one million open job opportunity in advanced manufacturing .,education
and thats everything that fall under that .,education
we think about the making of anything tangible that we have .,education
our computer the chair that we are sitting in the glass that we are both wearing .,education
manufacturing touch every single thing. . thats number one .,education
number two manufacturing now we have a new industrial revolution thats amongst u now .,education
the fourth industrial revolution is when the machine that are making thing are combined with the supercomputer .,education
the ai the automation the cloud the robotics and stuff that. . there is a big shift in what job are going to look going forward due to ai due to robotics due to automation .,education
and now we want to set kid up to be the people that are pushing the 21st century career forward or even to have them be working we need to start pushing thing problem solving .,education
and you got to figure that out. . being able to solve problem on the fly under pressure under stress within a team is something else that we need to do .,education
but some of these machine that we have before thirty printing are fiftyzero one hundredzero in every high school can afford those type of machine .,education
and then an instructor that know how to program these machine and teach the curriculum at the same time .,education
what we have now is weve got the digital era where a lot of those machine are digital to where you can have the machine and manipulate it on a laptop. . you do not necessarily have to have the machine in your program .,education
you do not have to have the expendables .,education
there opportunity online .,education
you can teach the same skill and kid can get that same knowledge and start building thing themselves and trying thing out .,education
or again i said a 3d printer fifty to one hundred .,education
you do not even have to have a curriculum .,education
there plenty of them that are free online .,education
there a lot of place that will help you build one for your school .,education
but if those thing do not even we are in the era now we are having one in your classroom and giving the kid access to it .,education
theyll gravitate to the 3d printer .,education
you two university theyll figure it out themselves .,education
and the one that want to put their foot on the pedal youll see them start making thing and connecting thing and doing it themselves .,education
and then thats the kid that you will power and say we need to put him in a robotics league program or we need to maybe help him start one in our school or whatever that look .,education
and i noticed that i know exposure and getting this message out is super important to you .,education
and i appreciate we talked a little a little about the jane adam resource corp or jart .,education
talk to me about the expansion that you all have rolling out .,education
jane adam resource corporation is corporation that started in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five before i wa born .,education
and theyve been doing a lot of the work to help people get pathway out of poverty by having good job .,education
and since then and even till now manufacturing career are one of the job you can get with the quickest amount of training it ha the highest starting pay and the career ladder is almost never ending .,education
there much that you can do with it .,education
theyve identified career in manufacturing cnc programming automation machining and welding a these career that offer the upward mobility .,education
we have four training center in chicago one in baltimore that we launched five year ago and then one in the woman prison in rhode island .,education
the machine is the nuclear engineer the nondestructing testing engineer we are able to take people from the community skill them up and then get them into accelerated program to be able to start filling those good job in detroit .,education
we are doing the same thing .,education
we are able to get into detroit and we are going to be launching the training there .,education
we are going to be focused more on mobility .,education
we are looking at anything thats moving .,education
if we are moving heart people product anything that detroit is trying to be the epicenter of the globe of everything that ha anything to do with mobile and mobility .,education
electric vehicle electric vehicle charging station everything that .,education
we are going to gear up and get the community ready to get skilled up and take those job a a they come .,education
hey man listen you you have your finger on the post man .,education
i think it is going to be a great episode when i saw you posting about the fact that it wa manufactured .,education
i said we have to do this .,education
i am also here .,education
some some phenomenal thing are happening in the state of illinois .,education
there a lot of there a lot of new energy around manufacturing and making here domestically in the united state .,education
whether thats the build back better plan whether thats the good job act whether thats a lot of reshoring effort to get a lot of the work that we exported to the china of the world and the career of the world back over here .,education
the government understands that weve got to make thing in america to be able to make it period and to bring our city back and to bring people back to a good middle class strong middle class .,education
some of the dope maker that are making thing that i can not say now .,education
but there are some product that are going to be released and they are there in illinois and they are from people that look you and me .,education
they had an idea and now these thing are real and their business .,education
and we want to tell a story .,education
people that are not in illinois but they are looking for a chance to make it themselves can come here .,education
if there company in illinois that say hey we want to connect with people to help them make it theyll connect .,education
we want to strengthen that ecosystem put maker on the bigger platform and get into the nitty gritty of what this manufacturing industry is about .,education
thank you for sharing that .,education
and i know it wa something that wa on my mind .,education
i think it is a matter of national security .,education
and i am on man .,education
one hundred percent .,education
when you think about the chip it is a need them for everything but we are not .,education
it is it is .,education
and the biggest question is if we not making them who is . . and in our phone on the computer that we are now in our car if these chip are made by an adversary they got the power to press a button and everything go crazy ?,education
definitely need to be making thing here .,education
the submarine industrial base and myself connected because the day after russia invaded ukraine i wa at the white house speaking with the president the joint chief of staff simultaneously the pentagon about our industrial base .,education
if we get pulled into a war effort now with the amount of thing that we are given to other country can we supplement ourselves to make more thing to protect ourselves and our industrial base is not big enough to support a war effort now ?,education
also if we had to go to war and we were pulled into war now we would have to purchase our jet fighter our tank our submarine from again another country that is capable of making them .,education
theyve got the drop on what we are making and what we have and all of those different thing .,education
it is imperative that we are making here and we are not making here but we are innovating a . and we are the forefront of that innovation .,education
anything else you can share from from that conversation at the white house any other outcome ?,education
what thought ?,education
if if if you look at build subarrange.com if you watch college football or the world series now nascar they are doing a big campaign to get submarine built .,education
the department of defense ha ordered three subarranges per year for the next eight year i want to say and thats going to take one hundredzero people to be one hundredzero more people to be able to do every year .,education
we are talking job that are starting at thirty an hour up to begin to start building these these submarine .,education
and a lot of time people think about our national security a u going somewhere fighting a war but a lot of the war do not happen because of the defense and the thing that we have .,education
a lot of people will not test u because they know what we are capable of and the thing that we make and the fact that we can turn them out and make them very very fast .,education
thats a strategic advantage of ours. . and with the conflict that have been going on and the people that weve been supporting we are pretty thin now. . we are not in a place that we are going to lose anything anytime soon .,education
however we need to be in a place where people do not want to think about testing u what i am saying ?,education
and now weve got thirty one nuclear warhead spread out around the world that belong to the united states. . and these are on submarine .,education
the reason they are on submarine is because a submarine ha a nuclear reactor inside of there it doesnt need gas .,education
it doesnt need any of those thing .,education
it can go perpetually forever. . another thing is nobody know where these thirty one warhead are .,education
not u not anybody in the united state navy or the department of defense .,education
what happens is they tell these submarine captain here a stretch of ocean .,education
it is yours .,education
get out there and they can be anywhere within that thing. . if any conflict happens at any time we could have a defense response .,education
they call it the second wave at a snap of a finger .,education
it is those capability that keep people from having a first wave of anything because they know what our second wave is going to be .,education
and most of those warhead that are on these submarine the submarine are fifty year old or older. . that doesnt mean the technology is bad because the government is usually forty year ahead of u in technology but we need to have a concept fleet .,education
this protection .,education
thats one of the big thing that we are working on now is making that happen .,education
it wa a different thing that meant different to people. . now there a different rhetoric on war and it definitely should be. . and we see kid that are protesting all the time and it is beautiful that they are protesting .,education
i do not think personally it is going to come from those protest .,education
i think there is going to be some change there and there value there .,education
but at the same time we need people with that mindset working for these companies. . and ill tell you why .,education
if you come from that mindset that war is not necessary .,education
we shouldnt have war and then you go work for a boeing or raytheon or something that and you are in the design department then you can change how war fall .,education
hey we are making drone that ha to ever go on the front line .,education
this is a war between drone .,education
this is a war between humanoid robot or whatever that look . . thats how you begin to change the narrative .,education
people did not the way that automobile were .,education
now we have electric vehicles. . people did not the way that electric vehicle were driving or people were driving .,education
weve covered a lot here man .,education
youve covered a lot .,education

plantation nail we do have quite a love of that .,education
it is no way in what he done .,education
let go back to learning difference on some people call them disability but i feel everybody learns differently you are one of the pioneer in reaching kid with learning disability tell u how what you did .,education
the first year i told wa one thousand nine hundred and forty six and it wa my nation from then on to find out why bright child did not always do in school .,education
i knew they were bright and through one thousand nine hundred and forty six that wa my mission to find out and it took me thirty year because i wa in the reading department and your answer is an odd in reading .,education
she became a technology leader not because she loved technology but because she loved child and knew we needed to harness technology to teach child the best .,education
if you look at her result through the year you will see that mrs. howard is an exceptional teacher .,education
now she is telling it it is from her experience and i fully know that some of the thing she say might be different from what you hear from popular motivational educational speaker thing all of kindergarten should be playtime .,education
however if you hear the testimony of the parent and the student who took mrs. howard class youll hear that they are spectator loved her class cried when they couldnt come to school and that student were transformed at home into happier healthier more helpful child .,education
i hope youll listen to what she say because how she talk to u on this podcast is also how she would talk to her student with respect simplicity and using word in meaningful way .,education
now miss howard and our friend and she make me call her sharon but i still look up to her and often talk to her about teaching when i see her at church .,education
now well talk to mrs. sharon howard with an excerpt from episode seven hundred and forty eight of the tenminute teacher podcast .,education
today we have a pleasure to interview one of my hero miss sharon howard .,education
she is a k5 teacher kindergarten teacher here at my school and she is retiring after forty four year of working with the student now in may of two thousand and twenty one .,education
shes finished up one whole year in all of his pandemic of facetoface instruction .,education
i do not think ill miss today .,education
they did not miss one day every single day with her kindergarten facetoface she is a remarkable woman and miss howard you are retiring .,education
how doe that feel to think about because teaching ha been such a part of your life hasnt it ?,education
yes yes definitely .,education
thats been my main goal is to maintain my family the best that i could .,education
my husband wa very supportive most of the time he wa up here after he retired to help me with bulletin board and all of my book collection because thats what ive done for forty four year is collect childrens book .,education
retired discussion something wa very interesting that wa said .,education
a person who had a child who wa a behavior problem before he came to you said his wife at parent teacher night before school start that down with you and said what are you going to do when my child miss behaves ?,education
what wa your answer in why ?,education
and wa the star student that i had no problem with with him .,education
your plan wa not having a discipline problem .,education
thats true .,education
now all child are different .,education
they come to you with all different personality .,education
they are some who to take charge but that wa part of my strategy is setting up where i stood in the class and what i expected of them .,education
and yes if there were time where somebody wa trying my patient to see how far i would go i gave them three strike and you are out .,education
if i had to speak to them three different time for the same offense then that meant three time and you will give me some of your play time. . did that doe that happen very much ?,education
it did not happen any this year ?,education
none of the more it is not even once .,education
i think my first year wa howard .,education
i always told my parent that if i have a school issue at school i to try to handle it between me and the student first .,education
when it get to the point that the child is not willing to work with me thats when i give them the option .,education
you can either work with me or we will give mom and dad a call and we will involve them .,education
i tried to give them choice ?,education
that wa the way that i taught them to grow and mature and start making good choice that pertain to themselves .,education
youve got your discipline plan is not a have a problem which is awesome .,education
what advice do you wish that you had known in the earlier year of your teaching ?,education
i think the idea of expecting high standard and high ideal for my child it is a transition from a k4 class to a k5 class .,education
there a big difference in that child and they are coming out of that playtime syndrome and they are coming into what i call real school because not many student in k5 learn to read to write learn to their number .,education

why is it that we all want something ?,education
we have goal we have thing that we believe are important but we struggle to focus on them .,education
yeah there a couple of different thing .,education
i think the first thing is that we hold our subback from a we have a lot of fear .,education
and fear when you start to dive into them you mentioned in the beginning of this i started talking to you about the east and i remember you told me in two thousand and seventeen you should read the bhagavad gita .,education
i wrote it by god the next week and read it while we were traveling .,education
and there wa that .,education
and a i wa writing the book i wa whats the thing ?,education
because you are talking about the book wa a psychology of taking action .,education
because i wa looking at the mindset mentor podcast .,education
i had onefour hundred episode and i wa it is me speaking for almost every single one of them .,education
and i wa what do i teach ?,education
what do people want for me ?,education
and i wa it is almost all tip and trick to understand yourself to take action .,education
because everybody who listening to a podcast ha the awareness of i want to improve i want to get better .,education
i want something different but how do i do it ?,education
and i started saying if taking action is what the book going to be about why do not people take action in the first place ?,education
and one of the thing that pop up for people is fear .,education
they are there some fear that pop up for them .,education
and i had a conversation with one of my friend who went and lived in the tribe with a tribe a native brazilian tribe in the middle of brazil .,education
and he had to fly into a town .,education
he had to hop on a boat and go for two day on a boat in the middle of nowhere .,education
and he started talking to me about these thing that he called primal fear and intellectual fear .,education
a primal fear is is pain or death is attached to it .,education
and we do not come up with too many primal fear in our life not is .,education
intellectual fear is what we deal with all day long which is the fear of rejection the fear of failure the fear of not being accepted the fear of success .,education
we all of these fear and all of these fear are made up in our mind .,education
and i wa listening to i am pretty sure it wa sad guru i wa listening to .,education
and i wa i put on and i wa driving around in sedona a i wa writing the book a they are to try to get my whole mind together by myself writing it .,education
and i wa look at it fear and trying to figure them out .,education
and one thing that he said that hit me more than anything else is ive identified my fear and the next thing is how do i overcome these fear ?,education
and if it is an intellectual fear the fear that exist in our mind is you can not overcome something that doesnt exist .,education
and we create we wake up in the morning we create the book you man which is the fear of success the fear of failure whatever it is .,education
and instead of taking the action that we need to and focusing on what it is that we want we take all of our focus and put it towards trying to overcome this fear .,education
when in reality the fear doesnt even exist in the first place .,education
and i think the biggest thing for most people is the fear is keeping you from focusing .,education
but there also the identity of who you think you are .,education
and one of my favorite thing is challenging who i think i am all the time .,education
i love the story and i put in the book of jim carrey when he decided to be in man on the moon .,education
then the man on the moon a movie where he ended up playing andy kaufman .,education
and there wa a whole documentary that wa done on this and they curved it for twenty year because it wa off the rail .,education
of how crazy he went .,education
and what he did wa he it is a documentary called jim and andy thats on him playing the role on man on the moon .,education
andy kaufman wa a guy who wa once alive .,education
and the crazy part about andy kaufman is he also played other character .,education
a jim carrey playing andy kaufman who played tony clifton and other character .,education
but the thing that happened with him wa that he would never break character .,education
he wa a method actor .,education
for four month he played a this real life person .,education
not jim carrey anymore .,education
and what happened wa he ended up and it get crazy where he end up doing therapy session with andy kaufman real daughter and his family .,education
help them overcome his sudden death .,education
and what happens is they stop recording four month later and he i do not know who i am .,education
and he lost to me wa .,education
and he i do not know my belief .,education
i do not know what make me happy .,education
what make me sad ?,education
what piss me off anymore ?,education
he ive lost to jim carrey is .,education
and thats his spiritual awakening that youve seen him go through over the past twenty year .,education
and he realized if i can lose jim carrey then who the hell is jim carrey ?,education
and he realized that jim carrey is a character that he playing all the time that is completely somebody else .,education
and he could wake up another morning and act he somebody else .,education
and i think that two of the thing that keep u from focusing on stuff is we get afraid and fearful of making change or judgment or failure and all that .,education
and the other thing is who we truly think we are .,education
well hold u back from taking either the action that we need to or staying in the exact same position that we are in .,education
i want to go down both of those route because i find them both fascinating for different reason .,education
and i want to go down that more spiritual ethereal journey a . because yeah but before we do that i want to make sure that .,education
if we talk about the fear that people are experiencing a you said a lot of the time it is an intellectual fear .,education
it is not real but it feel real .,education
those feel extremely real .,education
how do you process a feeling that feel real even though it may be intellectual ?,education
thats the beautiful thing about being a human .,education
and i think it is and you can correct me if i am wrong but i think it is in the bag of our gigi .,education
it give an example of a line attacking you at a tiger attacking you at night .,education
and one of the example i give in the book is it is similar to that where it is if you think about it if you weve all had this .,education
we have a intense dream .,education
you are walking in a forest whatever it is and a lion it start running after you .,education
you you you run from it you turn you look over your shoulder get close or you are still running from it you turn you look over your shoulder a teeth are about to dig into you .,education
and you wake up in the middle of the night and your body did not move at all .,education
but you are sweating you are out of breath your heart rate is intensely going .,education
and the amazing thing about being a human they usually say in any case is what your biggest strength is is also can be your biggest fault .,education
the thing about human is that we can project our mind into a future that doesnt exist yet .,education
and what we can do now is we can sit here we are in this studio everything is amazing .,education
we have food water shelter clothing everything .,education
but if i am a a lot of people do if i am starting a business i can sit here and i can think why do i want to start this business ?,education
but then i start playing out all of the thing that could go wrong which is what we tend to do .,education
not what go but what could go wrong .,education
when i project my mind into that future the crazy part is that my mind and my body are constantly connected .,education
my my brain is sending neuropeptides to my body and creating hormone a if that moment is happening now .,education
and what happens is we tend to a human a a protection mechanism we tend to project ourselves into a future that is fearful that is scary and that fearful scary feeling usually keep u in the exact same place .,education
and what i always say is if i am going to imagine the worst that could happen why do not i at least try to see the best that could happen ?,education
and if i am going to notice myself the awareness of i am in a lot of fear now with starting this business .,education
and i am going man whats the worst that could happen ?,education
then i am a close my eye and say whats the best that could happen ?,education
and what would it feel to start this business and to be able to crack a million dollar in a business ?,education
and how proud of myself would i be to break a million dollar in sale and to be able to build this and travel with my family and provide what ive always wanted to provide .,education
and if i am going to feel the feeling of fear why do not i also try on feeling the feeling of success in getting there ?,education
and if we notice it is an intellectual fear the first the first piece that i always say is there three piece there the awareness of it .,education
i am aware that i am in a state of fear .,education
i need to practice to get myself out of that .,education
if i notice myself in a state of fear whats my practice to get myself out of it ?,education
i am going to go ahead and i am going to calm down and take sixty breath and i am going to connect back to my heart and i am going to ask myself whats the best thing that could happen ?,education
thats the practice to get myself out of it .,education
and then the last piece is repetition .,education
it is awareness it is practice it is repetition .,education
if i do it over and over and over again eventually i start to rewire myself .,education
one of the thing that i found in myself year ago that i did not wa wa that i judge people .,education
and i am man i love people .,education
i love i try to do i try to be a surface a much a i can but an immediate thought that will come in my head sometimes is judgment of somebody that i do not know .,education
and i judge them .,education
and i wa i do not that pattern .,education
i want to change this pattern within myself .,education
i become aware of what i want to change .,education
and the first time i did it i wa at a grocery store and this guy had this bluetooth the long bluetooth .,education
i wa in a if he wa making cold call at an office but he wa at the grocery store .,education
and immediately the first thought of my head wa judgment .,education
and i always say you can not change your first thought but you could change your second thought .,education
i noticed the judgment a a first thought .,education
my practice that i decided for myself wa i am going to force myself in my head to say three thing that i about this guy .,education
i paused myself in the moment .,education
i found myself in a pattern that i do not want to be in anymore .,education
what are three thing that i about this guy ?,education
and then i went on about my day .,education
and i started doing this over and over and over and over again .,education
and one thing that i noticed is that my first thought started changing to le judgment and more acceptance .,education
because ultimately thats what i want to work on is more acceptance in loving of people and of myself .,education
and i think it is it is becoming aware of it .,education
once you are aware of the thing that you are trying the patio trying to change whats the practice that you are going to take yourself down .,education
and then noticing that you are going to need to do it over and over and over and over again .,education
but one of the biggest key is to give you yourself grace a you are doing it .,education
because a lot of time we make we are not become aware .,education
and then we judge ourselves and we beat ourselves out for it .,education
i think it is giving yourself a lot of loving grace and going hey ive noticed this pattern .,education
do not worry .,education
we are going to change it .,education
let go on this practice and continuing to do that .,education
said i think often we get scared even of having the thought of what could be possible because we are scared that it can not be possible .,education
and we find another thing to be fearful of .,education
and i love this idea of what you are saying around transforming your thought .,education
because ive definitely the more and more ive studied book the more and more ive read and ive thought ive discovered that all of our failure and success in life is based on our most repeated thought .,education
and one of my biggest question to most people i meet now is what is your most repeated thought ?,education
and most people do not know the answer because they are not aware in your word .,education
and a lot of people who do know will say it is something i am not good enough .,education
i do not the way i look .,education
i am whatever else it may be for them. ?,education
and we are either aware and it is negative or we are unaware because it is subconscious .,education
and ive started to recognize that most of the thought we have are not that different .,education
they are the same thought that come in a different voice a different tone a different vocabulary a different language but it is the same repetition .,education
and ive started to think about whats my most repeated thought ?,education
and how can i be more a you are saying how can i be more selective about it ?,education
and how can i choose it more effectively rather than let it be something thats coming up ?,education
and it is not do not identify with your thought .,education
one of the thing that i do not remember where i heard it before but the way i to think about it and ive heard you say before even a lot of people say i struggle with meditating .,education
and ive heard you say before where it is not about mastering your thought .,education
it is not about making your thought going away .,education
it is becoming aware of your thought a little bit more .,education
because when we close our eye about sixty of our brain is visual .,education
for visual thing to see .,education
when close our eye it turn off a lot of part .,education
and thought usually come up and we become aware of those .,education
one thing that ive been doing a lot recently is trying to be in a much silence a possible .,education
i am trying to be a much silence a i possibly can .,education
because i feel thats where a lot of my awareness is a lot of my answer come from .,education
and when you sit there and the analogy that i love when you start thinking of your thought is it is sitting on the edge of a mountain and down below there a road going that you are looking at .,education
and sitting on the edge of the mountain is meditating or sitting in silence .,education
and looking at your thought .,education
and you can watch the car go by the thought that go by and not have to be attached to them .,education
you do not find yourself getting sucked into the red car that went by .,education
you watch the car go by .,education
and thats the way that i try to to see my thought which is i am going to watch them go by .,education
i am not going to connect to them .,education
but i can look at them and be is this thought which about ninety of our thought the same a yesterday is this thought helping me in trying to get to where i want to be in life ?,education
or is this thought holding me back from trying to get to where i want to be in life ?,education
and if it is helping me then i want to strengthen it .,education
if it is not helping me then hey a i am a podcast that i can not get from my first thought about i can throw my second .,education
what would i prefer my second thought to be ?,education
yeah i think you hit the nail on the head .,education
thats what it is for me .,education
it is whether youve understood that you are not your thought or not .,education
that can be quite hard for people because i think we are close to them .,education
but even if you can practice distance through meditation or mindfulness the real win is being able to look at a thought and say is it good for me ?,education
or is it not helpful ?,education
you said i think that is the wisdom of it .,education
that can i evaluate everything thats repetitive in my mind and ask myself is this useful ?,education
is it helpful ?,education
is it allowing me to move in the direction i want ?,education
because chance are a lot of what we are saying is doing the complete opposite .,education
and then you go wait a minute even though it is interesting .,education
and even though i could get lost in it i do not want to waste time .,education
and therefore ill move in the other direction .,education
you talk about procrastination in this book .,education
and that again going back to your earlier title is a block against the psychology of action .,education
and we all have a friend or maybe we are that friend that constantly put thing off .,education
we say ill do another year .,education
someone been saying that for two year .,education
there someone listening now who want to start an instagram page .,education
they are put it off for six month .,education
there someone listening who i missed out on the club house thing .,education
and then i missed out on the tiktok thing .,education
and now i am missing out on whatever the next thing is .,education
and we procrastinate hoping that one day will come .,education
what if you learned about procrastination through your research when you are writing the book that ha helped people break that cycle because it seems to apply to many of our life ?,education
the thing about it is this if ive always i always to be very extreme in example because we can go extreme that it make a lot of sense .,education
but i always tell people and i always say hey ive given this one i used to give a lot of speech .,education
i would be in front of people and say hey whats the chance of you making a million dollar this year ?,education
give me give me number and everyones zero percent zero percent .,education
one percent there always one percent .,education
and thats the most thatll get to .,education
and i said i am going to give you the most extreme example but i want to see what happens. ?,education
whats the percentage chance of you making a million dollar this year ?,education
legally and if you do not everyone that you love dy .,education
and everyones one hundred percent one hundred percent a thousand a thousand percent .,education
the golden and change the time frame did not change why you are doing it changed ?,education
would you wake up in the morning if everyone that you love life depended on it and be yeah maybe i should scroll on tiktok for a little while .,education
no youd be i am going to take action immediately .,education
and it doesnt need to be a fear of losing everybody but whats behind that is why ?,education
why they are doing it ?,education
if i ever reflection of anyone who doesnt know jay you are one of the hardest working people ive ever met but you have a strong vibe. ?,education
and thats one of the best part about it where it is when i see jay i am this guy ha he ha this internal feeling of i want to change the world .,education
and you work hard trying to do it .,education
and thats one of the most beautiful thing about you is you are wanting to change a world and you have a strong why to it .,education
and i think that if most people could figure out yeah i want to do this thing .,education
why do you want to do it ?,education
and my my very first one on one coach used to say to me he would say whats your why ?,education
whats your why ?,education
why are you doing this ?,education
why are you doing this ?,education
you are hammer it home in my head .,education
and i wa why do you ask this much ?,education
and he would always say because if you are why is strong enough you are how will reveal itself ?,education
if why you want to do something how it is going to be done youll figure out .,education
thing are going to get in your way .,education
there going to be obstacle .,education
there always going to be obstacle .,education
there always going to be challenge .,education
always going to be moment of i do not know if i can do this .,education
but if you are why is strong it is i do not care what come up in front of me .,education
most people they want to be motivated .,education
and i have come to to hate the word motivation because motivation is fleeting .,education
we can wake up and we can listen to a podcast where we can get read something and be motivated .,education
and then something can happen to u and it is gone which disappears .,education
what i want to be is i want to be driven .,education
when a driven person it in the rise yeah they are not stopping .,education
and the difference between a motivated person and driven person is that the driven person ha this why that they want to see have happened in the world or in their life or further family .,education
and i think if people are i want to accomplish this goal the very nice question is why .,education
and then go why why why why why why why why why i am going to deeper into it .,education
an example i given the book is i had a coaching client year ago eight nine year ago .,education
and he wa rob i want to make a hundred thousand dollar this year .,education
and i wa why ?,education
and i took him through whats called seven level of why keep asking why why why why why why why .,education
and and went from i want to make a hundred thousand dollar this year because ive never done it before to the eventual thing wa he had got into a divorce a couple of year ago .,education
both of his young child lived in a bad part of town with his ex wife .,education
he wanted to regain custody because he wa afraid that both of his child would be killed and a drive by .,education
and he wa terrified of it that that wa his actual true why .,education
and it wasnt the motivation i did not have talked to him say hey how close youd make a hundred thousand dollar this year i said hey how close youd provide him more safety for your child this year ?,education
because he wanted them to move in with him .,education
he wanted to be able to provide for them and to make sure that they were safe .,education
and i think that if we ask ourselves why do i truly want to accomplish this goal ?,education
it reveals itself and it make a lot easier to take the action .,education
yeah for sure .,education
i i appreciate all the word but i can definitely say the only thing thats kept me going is my wife because i think there are many thing that either make you want to give up or slow down or become lazy or complacent .,education
and when i look at it and someone asked me this i wa sitting with another creator end of last year and he wa to me jay why do you even do anything anymore ?,education
whats the point ?,education
why do you need to do anything ?,education
and i wa weve got to the start of it .,education
i got to the beginning of rereini to be .,education
i wa weve got to a point where we can connect with lot of people .,education
but we need to give people the stepbystep process to transform their life .,education
and now we can take them on the journey because people are listening they are engaged we have a community we have a connection with people but when i started out we did not have any of that .,education
i see a we got to the start of where i want to be because and it wa interesting to me that many people struggle to find their way .,education
and i think it is because we do not no one and you said your coach helped you do it .,education
it wa same with me my art teacher at from age eleven to age eighteen .,education
he wa my art teacher at school .,education
and every time id paint something or draw something or do a collage or graphic design .,education
and whatever i do the first question you asked me is why did you do it ?,education
and id be my initialist want to look good .,education
and hed be every year hed be why did you do it ?,education
and id be because this color match with this color .,education
and then we are why do you do it ?,education
and i am because it reveals the metaphor that i think this is about and then hed be why did you do it ?,education
and i am because thats how i am feeling now .,education
i am trying to and every year hed asked me he would reveal more and more layer of my psyche in a similar way .,education
and again ive owed it to someone in my life who pushed me to ask the question why same a you .,education
and i think what we are both saying is please ask that question to yourself .,education
but what if someone asks that question and they feel stuck ?,education
and they go ive asked it but it is want a nice house i want a nice car i want to it is not that deep .,education
and i think you are you said we do not have a lot of primal fear .,education
some people are listening now will have fear of survival .,education
and that is driving them .,education
and they all working hard and they are pushing .,education
and at the same time well have people who driven but they are i am not driven enough because i havent got anything to be that scared about what that worried about .,education
how do you that person discovered that way ?,education
yeah i think for me it is my life wa never terrible .,education
or when i when i started the yeah when i started the podcast the mindset meant to or i wa at a point in my life where i wa making a whole bunch of money .,education
and i wa twenty seven year old and i wa making two hundred and fifty grand a year and i wa working from home and everything wa great .,education
but i felt i wa slowly withering away .,education
and i could see what the future wa going to be while i wa there .,education
and i said if i do this for another five year .,education
and i am thirty two year old i am still doing this .,education
is that going to fulfill me ?,education
and it gave me more anxiety to think about having my manager job .,education
and then i sat there and i thought i want to do this podcast thing .,education
it seems to be going pretty .,education
i want to coach people .,education
i want to help people .,education
and i also at the same time wa starting an amazon business and trying to make money online and do that .,education
and i thought about it .,education
and i asked myself if i fast forward five year from today do i want to be the person to sale management ?,education
i am doing now and consulting .,education
do i want to be the guy thats selling stuff on amazon and incredible amazon business person ?,education
or do i want to be the guy thats coaching people and helping people change your life ?,education
and the immediate answer wa very clear coaching people and changing their life .,education
and i wa that feel it is the path .,education
and then immediately come up is all kind of fear .,education
because i do not know what i am doing .,education
back in the day two thousand and fifteen nobody made any money and podcast .,education
i did not have any idea of how to grow a business any of that type of stuff .,education
but what wa important to me wa number one when i fast forwarded into the future .,education
the future that i did not want seemed way more painful than trying the unknown .,education
and what could be if i did take the path ?,education
and that wa that became more of a fear .,education
the fear of judgment the fear of putting myself out there the people opinion it wa there .,education
it is still there .,education
and i do not know if you ever get past it but shes getting more used to it .,education
but the fear of being in the exact same position working the same job made making a little bit more money doing this for every day .,education
and the day i died wa terrifying .,education
that wa that wa a fear .,education
and i wa then this path of the unknown is not a scary .,education
and i might a take this path of the unknown .,education
and ill be fully transparent .,education
there wa i shared this on one other time i think .,education
there wa a moment in two thousand and fifteen where i started the podcast in august of two thousand and fifteen .,education
november of two thousand and fifteen i wa feeling a whole lot of fear .,education
and i wa i might have to go back and work for someone else again .,education
and it wa fear wa in my head .,education
i got a new house .,education
i do not know how i am going to do this .,education
i am not making any money doing this .,education
my sister came out to me .,education
and i believe if you are silent the message is always there .,education
if you are looking the message is always there .,education
my sister ha at her house .,education
and she go hey have you ever seen this box of dad stuff ?,education
and i wa no and she brought it .,education
my father wa an alcoholic .,education
he passed away and i wa fifteen from his alcoholism .,education
and she brought out this box .,education
and it wa his glass .,education
he wa a t shirt of his .,education
and the other thing were a bunch of letter .,education
my dad wa in jail for a little while for multiple duis .,education
and they put him in jail .,education
and he would write letter to u . and he wrote a letter to my sister on a 19th birthday .,education
and i wa reading this two thousand and fifteen .,education
he had a wrote it to in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine .,education
and the very last line wa i hope you live your life with courage love and laughter .,education
and i read it and it wa the universe warped .,education
and i wa he wrote this for me .,education
there wa a moment where i wa he wrote this to my sister .,education
but the universe is giving this message through my dad because i need to hear this now .,education
because i am in much fear .,education
and the very first line is courage .,education
live your life with courage love and laughter .,education
and i wa i got to commit .,education
i i this ha to be the thing .,education
ive got to make a decision .,education
and when you look at the root word of decision it is decaderaary which mean to cut off .,education
i am going to cut off all other option .,education
i had her will smith say there no reason to have a plan because it is a distraction from playing a it is got to be the thing .,education
and i wa my god i got to commit to this thing .,education
i can not have any more feeling of i am going to go back to work for someone else .,education
this is my life path .,education
they are going to succeed at it .,education
and i wa i do not know what to do .,education
i wa i am going to get this tattoo to my arm .,education
i have get live your life with courage love and laughter .,education
tattoo to my my very first tattoo i ever got .,education
but it wa for me people always think when you make a decision the fear disappears i wish that i could do these thing .,education
but it is it is always there .,education
but youve got to learn that the fear is always going to be there .,education
but my bigger fear is getting to end in my life and having not done this having not tried to help people .,education
being in the room with with my father after he passed away when i wa fifteen year old and realizing because he wa a first person .,education
i ever met the past away .,education
i am going to be there one day .,education
i wa yeah thats i am going to he he wa a dreamer and he wa an amazing person .,education
but he did not do what he wanted to do .,education
i am not going to live that life .,education
i am going to create what i want to create .,education
and now i have all of the other fear that everyone else ha but my biggest fear is getting to end in my life and not having tried or not having at least gone for it .,education
yeah thats i love hearing that .,education
and youve reminded me of a great speech that jim carrier gave fun of the enough .,education
and he talked about how he died .,education
and i could begin this wrong .,education
but he said that his dad wa an accountant and he did that to be safe .,education
and he said that when he wa young his dad got made redundant from his safe job. . jim carrier said that in life you are probably going to fail at something you do not love .,education
you might a try something you do love. . this idea that i am choosing the safe option or i am choosing some of my parent thought my family wanted or i am choosing something .,education
i think is secure even thats unstable and uncertain .,education
and the uncertainty that you pursue is le fearful .,education
because you are on top of it .,education
because it is perfect .,education
and my id say my best habit in life is recognizing that that is the biggest myth that weve been sold .,education
and i do not accept it .,education
and i am that my life requires constant work ethic and effort and awareness and being a student and being conscious because that is whats being demanded by this world a uncertain world force you to be conscious .,education
but if you are unconscious in an uncertain world thats leading to a dangerous place .,education
and but i think we are waiting for that moment where we can not be conscious because it is much hard work .,education
but to your point it is way harder work being unconscious .,education
because the amount of unconscious issue that arise are numerous .,education
i think there a lot of wisdom in what you said because a lot of people would rather be let me get to this destination once and everything becomes better .,education
hey i want that too .,education
i do too. . and i thought that for a long time .,education
and it is interesting the journey that ive had is i always wanted to make money because i thought money wa going to give me what i needed .,education
it would give me that safety and security that i never felt a a child .,education
and then i got to a goal that i wanted to get to .,education
and i realized i feel exactly the same a ive always felt .,education
i do not feel any more loved .,education
and what i realized is what i wa searching for from the external world is what i wa searching for for myself .,education
and i am trying to be there a the thirty eight year old man for the nine year old boy thats still healing .,education
and what ive realized is that none of the material thing anything externally will ever give me what i wa ever searching for .,education
everything ive always searched for in the external wa what ive been searching for for myself .,education
and i do not one hundred agree with you .,education
i do not think there any destination we ever get to .,education
i think i am constantly going to overcome more thing every single day .,education
and if i live to one hundred i would be lucky and another sixty two more year i do not expect that i am going to get to the end of my life and be i figured it out .,education
yeah absolutely .,education
i heard this you remind me of this story thats told about benjamin franklin and benjamin franklin had thirteen virtue and these were quality that he aspire to develop in his life simplicity or authenticity patience thing that .,education
and when he wa on his deathbed they asked him which one he did not accomplish and he said it wa the 13th one and they said what wa that ?,education
and he said humility .,education
and i loved that because i think what you are saying is humility doesnt mean your meek or weak .,education
it mean i am able to accept there always more to learn .,education
i do not know everything and it is .,education
i am going to give myself grace for it too .,education
it is not a feeling of i am useless because i do not know .,education
it is ill become more useful if i recognize there are thing that i still have to learn .,education
and when i am listening to you about your spiritual journey and that silence i am intrigued by that walk u through how you filled that void almost practicewise because i identify with that fully and it is funny because we always talked about how our life will opposite .,education
because when i met you id gone down this deep spiritual path but i had no money .,education
and you and the other boat where you had sustained yourself financially and created a good stable place for yourself but you were seeking spiritually .,education
and we are at ?,education
we had that conversation .,education
and let talk about that too .,education
but i am intrigued a to how doe that couple of hour or whatever that time on your porch .,education
how do you do that for people ?,education
because i think we the sound of that but then we get distracted by the next thing .,education
what ive come to find and i can speak with them myself and what ive seen from other people .,education
but what ive seen with them myself is that ive learned a lot of lesson from my dad .,education
most of them after his death and me processing thing .,education
my father wa the way that he wa and he became an alcoholic because he had thing in his past that he hadnt worked through .,education
and the thing that he had in work through is when he wa twelve year old my father heard a gunshot .,education
he walked into the room and his dad had shot himself in the mouth at the shotgun .,education
and my dad grew up in rural tennessee .,education
this is 1960s when this happened .,education
1960s when this happened .,education
there wasnt a whole lot for him to understand it .,education
they werent podcasts .,education
they werent book to read we have nowadays .,education
and i always consciously knew that what wa happening wa that he had not healed his pain .,education
and gabber marta say do not ask why the trauma asked why the pain .,education
and when i first heard gabber marta i wa my god someone finally saying what i always thought with my father .,education
and we can look at him and say i he an alcoholic and he did not overcame a trauma .,education
the trauma that it came up in my life a i became a alcoholic .,education
and i did not sometimes we could see someone and say they drink too much alcohol .,education
they do too much drug .,education
they eat too much food .,education
and we can say yeah thats their addiction .,education
the problem in the hard thing in our society is that my addiction of workaholic is rewarded .,education
and people look up to it .,education
and they are you are doing great .,education
you are making much money .,education
all of this is good .,education
and what i came to find is that my workaholism wa me trying to not feel my feeling and to not work through and process those thing .,education
scrolling on social medium could be that way for somebody .,education
it could be some people are addicted to working out .,education
some people are addicted to watching tv .,education
and there many some people addicted shopping .,education
there many different addiction that we have .,education
and what i found is that the hardest thing for me wa to stop into not have to i wa always trying to fill every single moment of my day .,education
always try to be busy .,education
when i did not have something to do id find something to do on my business .,education
business you can always work all day every day .,education
and what ive tried to do and ive built in my business is a lot of system and process through my my vp of operation is helped me with this a ton .,education
to people take a lot of stuff off of my plate .,education
that i have more time to be .,education
it is my personal belief that i think that god the universe life whatever it is speaks in silence .,education
and if i want those message i need to be silent .,education
what i found for myself is when i would be silent a lot of anxiety would come up .,education
and if you got to go to the next thing you got to go to the next thing .,education
this is stupid .,education
you should be doing something else .,education
and then i realized that what i wa trying to do is achieve to fill a void .,education
but i could sit here and there been moment where ill sit on my porch and ill start cry .,education
and i am sometimes it is gratitude .,education
my god i can not believe ive been given this life .,education
i can not believe ive had these challenge .,education
i can not believe that ive had this come up with i am grateful for every single aspect of it .,education
and sometimes i sit there and tear up and i am i do not know what this is .,education
but this is something my body releasing .,education
and i need to be with this releasing process .,education
there interesting thing that people could look at .,education
there two video that are interesting on youtube .,education
one of them is called polar bear trauma where they show a video of polar there and they shoot away the tranquilizer gun from a helicopter .,education
the chase it down the helicopter heightened experience .,education
they shoot away the tranquilizer gun .,education
it is still awake .,education
but it is not completely out .,education
and it start having a convulsion .,education
start seasuring .,education
and eventually after it seasers it is what it is doing is it is releasing all of the cortisol all of the adrenaline from it body that there no trauma that come with it .,education
and then it go after it is shaken for a while .,education
take a deep breath and it calm down .,education
almost identical video of a impolite get attacked by a jaguar and the jaguar get scared off .,education
it start to convulse .,education
take a deep breath and then it move it .,education
and we are taught in our life at some point in time not to remove this and to work through these trauma and these feeling .,education
i think child naturally do it through temper tantrum .,education
they move it and sometimes a adult we either need to have an adult temper tantrum in safety where you take a pillow and you can be angry you can be mad you can scream you can cost you can smash it against the bed .,education
whatever it is in safety by yourself without other people around you do not scare them a . and then sometimes it is also sitting there in silence and realizing that what is coming is going .,education
it is when you squeeze an orange whats inside of it or it is juice because thats whats in it .,education
when you sit there and you put pressure on yourself or you give yourself space whats coming out is whats inside and your body natural intelligence is trying to let go of it .,education
and for me thats what i found is that there some moment where i am incredibly grateful .,education
there some moment where i am by doing nothing jay .,education
i get much anxiety and i am what is this ?,education
and instead of running from it i get curious .,education
and i think if we could get more curious ive been reading a whole lot of christian mercy recently .,education
i love christian mercy .,education
and one thing he say is do not know yourself because knowing is based in the past and past is based off of memory .,education
start learning yourself which is in the present moment .,education
be present and be what come up .,education
how can i be curious about this anxious feeling or these tear or whatever it is ?,education
and be being the space to know your self a little bit better .,education
yeah it is great .,education
talking about that that go to me back to what we were talking about .,education
the start of it .,education
you were saying how this idea of what if the worst thing happens what if the best thing happens .,education
then who are we ? .,education
come back to this know that i self is his learning and that i self what ha that spiritual journey taken you want to understanding identity .,education
god thats how it is deep a it can go .,education
that i am i am to solve that that chose this life .,education
and one of the thing that i to do is i to think that i chose this life .,education
and that immediately take me from being a victim in my life .,education
what wa me ?,education
my father wa this way .,education
he did this to me .,education
my mom did this to me .,education
and my teacher is acted this way .,education
versus me going i think my soul chose this life because this is whatever is needed for this path that it is on for whether it is reincarnation or whether it is heaven or hell or whatever there it come after this .,education
i do not know but i do know now i do have this life a rob dial .,education
and a i get older the thing i realize that my body change .,education
i am not a fast a i used to be .,education
i am a lot more sore than i used to be my body changing but my soul is this thing that is always there .,education
and the thing that ive that ive come to realize is that i want to i do not know if it is going to sound weird i want to unattach myself from this body from everything around me .,education
and i want to try to connect back to whats internally inside of me .,education
and the one thing that i find is that that never change that there a a truth thats behind that .,education
and truth is the thing that never change .,education
something change or if something could be questioned it is not true .,education
and but there this feeling that feel truth inside of me at least and everybody ha their own truth .,education
but for me my truth is there something thats behind all of it .,education
and the more that i connect to it the more peace that i have .,education
i listen to a lot of romdos .,education
and one of the thing that he said i wa listening to him on the drive over here and i listen to his meditation every day is the only work that you have to do is the connection to your own heart .,education
and i am always constantly thinking whats in the way of my own heart ?,education
what material possession what thing that i want to get or in the way of that ?,education
and the reason i think that it help is number one ive had much more peace from trying to connect to that .,education
and my relationship with my wife ha been much better because of it because i am not blocking her from letting her in .,education
shes experiencing me fully .,education
she start to be able to open up even more in different way .,education
id be able to experience her more fully .,education
and for me it is connecting to the thing thats behind it that feel the only thing thats truth .,education
now mind you if rob fifteen year ago had heard this youd be what the hell is that guy talking about ?,education
but on this journey ive realized that there something behind it all .,education
and i want to try to connect that something behind it all and see what it is .,education
and for me it is i to use myself a a guinea pig .,education
everything i teach in the mindset mentor and the podcast is all stuff that i am trying within myself .,education
and i use it a almost my own therapy session where i am talking to everybody but i am talking to myself .,education
i am reminding myself of all these thing .,education
and what i realize is i realized that after fifteen nineteen year of personal development it is personal element this this this this cup here .,education
and i feel my cup in person wa overflowing .,education
and then i found spiritual development .,education
and i realized my god it is a lot bigger cup .,education
and it is not even close to being full .,education
and it need it is my next thing that i am working on .,education
for me it is the mindset that working through i am constantly working on this and trying to get better .,education
but for me it is i want to connect to myself and see what else is in there .,education
yeah for sure .,education
thank you for sharing that .,education
you made me remember a c lewis statement that say you do not have a soul you are the soul and you have a body .,education
and i remember i used to have that written on a little person .,education
and i used to look at it every day fasting in the morning .,education
because i wa thinking about this concept of identity that the first thing ninety nine of u do when we wake up fasting in the morning is we look in the mirror .,education
usually we say something i look tired or do not that spot .,education
god whatever it is ?,education
now all of a sudden we are already in the bodily concept of life .,education
this bodily consciousness .,education
and now you live your whole day thinking about the body what is the body need the body need food et cetera .,education
and and thats natural .,education
thats not unnatural .,education
thats normal .,education
i do that too .,education
but then you are saying that at the same time youve got a nurture and nourished and connect with this deeper sense .,education
how do you balance the tune of real world where you have responsibility you have bill you have thing to do that are connected to the body .,education
but then at the same time we are you are not this body .,education
how do you make sense of these two seemingly opposite pursuit ?,education
i am the thing that i think i would have thought five or ten year ago wa that the more that i get into spiritual development the le motivated ill become of the most the le i will want to achieve .,education
that hasnt gone away in a way .,education
but what i have found is that i achieve through a place of of it is more i am not white not clean my way through life anymore .,education
i am not i can take action and not be wrapped up in my fear in my limiting belief .,education
and it is not i am in the world and in of the world at the same time where it is the soul is here and i get a i am speaking to everything that i say is also something that i struggle with every single day .,education
i am not master this process .,education
therell be time where i find myself in the world .,education
and i am stress there thing happening there this business where all of this weve got employee we are hiring people there stuff happening .,education
and then i take u to that back and i am it is it is a a game take a second .,education
thats it is all real .,education
it is i am not saying that it is not true .,education
it is not reality .,education
it is not in front of you .,education
it is all there .,education
but behind it all if i can connect to a deeper sense thats within me and the the soul that i feel is in there i am hey man chill out for a second .,education
it is not that big of a deal. ?,education
most thing there are there are definitely some thing that are big deal and people life and there death and there there thing that people have to be in control of them be able to pay bill and all that stuff .,education
all those are real and they are definitely necessary .,education
but behind it all you are still there .,education
and there this thing that if i can take myself back and out of my own heading into my heart which ha been a big journey for me because i wa i am analytical and wa never taught feeling and how to feel and process emotion .,education
but if i can take myself out of my head and into my heart what ive always found is that my head is always projecting itself into the future or sometimes projecting itself a the past .,education
but most for me if i sit on a meditative sometimes it is all of my todo list all of the thing that i have to do and it is projecting itself into the future .,education
my brain is always somewhere else .,education
my body it is always here .,education
and when i notice myself get stressed i notice myself get anxious i notice myself whatever feeling that might be feeling if i can take a couple of deep breath and get back into my body i am it is not that bad .,education
youll fit you you have overcome many thing in your life .,education
youll figure out a way to get through it .,education
and what ive found is that it is not that i do not take the action .,education
it is not that i am not wanting to achieve more and more thing and be able to have more fun and do all of this stuff in the external world .,education
but when i find myself take a step back and be in my heart is it make it a lot easier ?,education
i am not white knuggling and forcing my way through life .,education
it is almost i am allowing life to happen through me .,education
and i do not know how it work and i do not pretend to be smart enough .,education
but thing start happening around me that help me in the process of getting to whatever it is that i want to truly go .,education
yeah it is there this interesting thing in easter tradition .,education
there this obviously this idea of oneness and everythings one .,education
and then there this idea of duality that there this side and then there this side .,education
and one teaching that ive connected with is this idea of simultaneously one and different .,education
and it sound complex but it is not .,education
it is this idea that this feel real and it can be real and it is real and at the same time there is a greater reality .,education
rather than this feeling of everythings one everythings the same or it is disconnected there real and fake .,education
it is this idea that a lot of thing are real but then on the full picture .,education
the idea that today in la it is saying the weather rainy and cloudy .,education
but thats not the weather everywhere .,education
it is my current reality but it is not reality across the whole world .,education
and when you start looking in life in that way if there this reality and then there this bigger reality i think thats that zoom out .,education
thats that .,education
let me take a breath .,education
thats that .,education
i believe what i do is significant .,education
and at the same time it is insignificant .,education
we will not be remembered in a thousand year .,education
and it is .,education
and but we take it .,education
and if you only do one or the other if i only see my life a extremely significant everythings too high pressure .,education
my gosh i would it would hurt me .,education
and it would cause me pain if i thought everything i did wa of utmost significance .,education
and if i do my life wa insignificant if i do my life a irrelevant that would be bad for myself .,education
i still do anything .,education
i will not be able to function. . and i think it is interesting because the more and more i am learning i might have to learn how to hold these two seemingly opposite thing .,education
but they are connected in symbiotic and they are synchronous because they both have value going back to which thought ha value .,education
the collective thought of my life is significant and insignificant is the most helpful thought .,education
and because thinking i am significant and insignificant of both unhelpful thought .,education
you summarized perfectly what i feel ha been going through my head for year which is what i do i do believe is important .,education
and at the same time i am none of it matters. . it is this weird duality .,education
it is free .,education
but it is free because it take much pressure off where it becomes fun .,education
it is how can i bring more fun into life ?,education
when did we lose the joy of life and the fun of life that we had a child ?,education
when wa a program dot of u ?,education
and how can i connect to that child and bring that spirit back in and be yeah i am going to do some amazing thing in the world ?,education
but without it being stressful with with it being fun and with it being something that i can do and it effortlessly flow out of me .,education
i believe that every single person is incredibly creative .,education
and we are we are creator at the actual core of u and a lot of u have lost it .,education
and i lost it for year .,education
and what i think is how can i make the creativity flow out of me in some way ?,education
and allow the space for it to happen .,education
and one of the thing that happens and it is not necessarily my goal of it .,education
but when i sit in silence i get idea that come through and i am man i do not know how i did not see this .,education
and thats where they all are .,education
it is a lot of time we are trying to force thing to have .,education
we are trying to force creative or try to force idea .,education
but sometimes when i get there i am man yeah this is the thing ive been searching for .,education
and it is i think every person need to give themselves a little bit more space to not be on their phone to not be constantly and a lot of people have child there their child are up .,education
can you wake up a little bit earlier not be on your phone ?,education
and sit in silence and see what come up .,education
and i think that it is important for people because what youll notice is exactly what you are saying which is what we do this life is important .,education
but it is very insignificant .,education
and thats .,education
there nothing wrong with that .,education
ive i love watching video on youtube about how small the earth is compared to the rest of the universe .,education
and then it stress my wife out .,education
shes i am going to have a panic attack .,education
why why do you watch this ?,education
because i wa i to remind myself that even though it is all happening and i am in it none of it truly matter .,education
and thats .,education
and i think when i am listening to you there this feeling that i feel i agree with you .,education
i think everyone is a creator .,education
i do believe that creativity flow when we connect with that .,education
but i think sometimes we feel distracted from it .,education
and it is much easier to pull out of on it much easier to put on a show in the background .,education
it is much easier to do all of these .,education
it is much easier to do all those thing at the same time .,education
now we are no longer ever with one person .,education
we are with one person .,education
we are both on our phone .,education
and we are watching a show at the same time .,education
youve got three screen in front of you five screen in total .,education
and there this much distraction ?,education
we know that how doe a person possibly ?,education
and i say this out of compassion and empathy because it is it requires much from us. ?,education
because everything around u is built for distraction .,education
the food we are eating the thing we drink and consume the stuff thats created around u it is all to distract .,education
you are fighting almost what feel to a lot of people losing battle. ?,education
what do you do to get pick yourself back up ?,education
whats more whats more important than that ?,education
whats more important than connecting to your true self to working on yourself ?,education
why do i why am i hardcore in mindset ?,education
because i know how many people are wrapped up in their mindset and their thought and their belief and their pattern that they are stuck in .,education
and what ultimately we all want i think is freedom .,education
and the way to get through to that freedom is to work on yourself .,education
whatever that look for whatever stage someone is in .,education
and i can have empathy for every person at every stage because ive been through many stage of my process .,education
and i think that it come back to why are you doing it ?,education
what do you want ?,education
if you are trying to disconnect from your phone why ?,education
for me i recently deleted instagram from my phone .,education
i did it last year for a month .,education
the book came out and i wa i got ta get back on .,education
i got to make sure thing are good .,education
i get recently deleted it again .,education
and now everything that i post everything flow through my team .,education
i am not it is gone .,education
it is now i happen to to flow everything flow through my team .,education
why did i do that though ?,education
wa because i do not want to live my life on that phone .,education
and the one thing that i noticed is that instagram wa one of the thing where i would pick it up and i would somehow get to it .,education
and i wasnt even thinking about getting to it .,education
and i wa my life is not this little tiny thing .,education
my life is everything thats out here .,education
and why do i want to get why did i delete it wa because i want to be in everything .,education
i want to be present with my life .,education
when we have child i want to be present with our child .,education
i want to be the most present version of myself a i possibly can .,education
and i can not imagine that ill get to the end of my life be one hundred year old and be i wish i would spend more time on instagram .,education
i wish i would spend more time watching netflix .,education
and i have ive been addicted to all of those thing .,education
i am not above any of this stuff .,education
but i started looking at myself and saying is this helping me get to where i want to be in life ?,education
is it creating more peace in my life ?,education
for me it wa creating way more stress to u perpetuating these feeling that i am trying to let go of and trying to work with .,education
and for me i think whats important to people is if you want to make a change why do you want to make the change ?,education
and for me looking at a screen is not a important a physically being in front of my wife and giving her what she truly deserves which is a one hundred of my attention .,education
because there been time where ive not given her one hundred of my attention .,education
and a we start to have kid and stuff i do not want to be a distracted parent .,education
i want to be with them .,education
ill never sit there and go when my kid were kid my kid were child .,education
i wish i would spend more time on instagram .,education
i wish id spent more time watching netflix .,education
i think for me the level of the place i met in my life is i want to be a present a possible because ive worked for thing that ive climbed ladder .,education
ive gotten different place .,education
ive realized none of those thing fulfilled many way .,education
and this journey ive been on in the past ten year seven year ago and we started talking about the bag of agita and i started meditating a whole lot more and getting into a i realized these thing are bringing me peace .,education
and the more peaceful i feel the more that it becomes easy to achieve and create the stuff that i want to live for .,education
and for me the presence in the peace at this point in my life thing might change .,education
i do not know what it is going to be in five year or thing that are the most important to me .,education
yeah it is interesting .,education
i think we feel being anxious and being busy and stuff will create the most effectiveness. . but you said this idea of if you start from a place of peace .,education
and i think about the i completely agree with that .,education
if you walk into something with stillness it give you clarity give you perspective you can zoom out you can zoom in .,education
if you are buzzing around and moving around you lose all of that .,education
it is all blurry and fuzzy .,education
and i want to ask you whats whats a lesson you wish you learned earlier in life .,education
i think it is that what you are searching for externally you are searching for yourself .,education
i think thats become very apparent to me in the past few year is a i wa always looking for somebody to give me love somebody to give me acceptance to a chief that i could be accepted .,education
and what i truly think is what i wa searching for from everyone else is what i wa searching for for myself .,education
a lot of people that are a lot of people i know are people please they may rob them people easier .,education
and it is theyll change themself to try to get love and acceptance from somebody else .,education
but thats filling up it is a hungry ghost .,education
it is the food go through the ghost .,education
it doesnt go anywhere .,education
and what we are searching for is what we are searching that love and acceptance for ourselves .,education
and one of the biggest thing that i think ive learned in probably the past two year is i wa always trying to grow and change myself because there were aspect of myself that i did not .,education
and what ive changed into in the past couple of year is i am going to love every aspect of myself .,education
there some part of rob that are beautiful that are amazing that love people that want to connect there there some great part of rob .,education
there some part of rob also that are very selfish that are very judgmental that are a little bit short not a present a he should be .,education
instead of trying to change those and hate those ive tried to love them .,education
and realized that the selfish rob that exists wa some thing that he that wa a part of past conditioning that came up from needing to be selfish a a child for whatever it might have been whatever reason it might have been .,education
and i can love that what i realize is that if i try to change it it get stronger if i love it and i accept it it chill out .,education
i am not yeah these part of me do not exist .,education
it is me looking internal family system is a therapy where you look at all part of you and who you are and you try to figure out a way to understand how the entire orchestra work together .,education
when i wa writing my book i wa sitting there and i wa i wa going hard core .,education
you and i come from the world of creating viral video .,education
i would spend much time on every single line to make sure it wa perfect ?,education
because i wanted to make sure ive only got thirty second or a minute to get the the message to be a clear and concise a possible .,education
let me try to make a perfect a possible .,education
and i used to do a lot of poetry and i used to do a lot of songwriting when i wa younger .,education
i wa used to making every line a potent a i could .,education
a i wa writing this book i wa sixteen round of edits in editing every single piece of it .,education
and there a part of me that said it is said why are you doing this ?,education
why are you doing this ?,education
and i wa i want to write a book that help people and change people life .,education
i want someone to not know what the mindset of a pro podcast is but they walk in a barn and nobody see a book and they are interesting .,education
let me read it .,education
let me pick it up and they read it and it change their life .,education
and then i played devil advocator .,education
and i said but you also want it to be successful .,education
you also want it to be a new york time best seller .,education
you can have a little badge to put on your self and say new york time best seller .,education
you want it to be this incredibly selling thing because if it take off you are going to make great money for a very long time if it is a perennial seller .,education
and i thought to myself can i use that ego excited of me to help me create a better book ?,education
and i could .,education
and what i realized is instead of hating that aspect it is a tool in my tool belt .,education
when i need to bring that side of me out i can bring outside of that side of me out and say what ?,education
i am going to create the best freaking book that i can the best podcast that i can the best real that i can to try to impact people .,education
and it is not about trying to force change on myself .,education
it is about loving every aspect of myself .,education
the quote unquote good and bad even though there is no good or bad but every aspect of rob .,education
and if i need to use it i can bring it up and say hey rob i need this version of you now .,education
but i am not going to fight it anymore .,education
and the monastery we are doing is talking about how the word is an arthur which mean unwanted thing that seems unwanted need to be engaged .,education
you need to engage it in the service of doing something higher. ?,education
for it to be purified .,education
thats why you can not cut it out .,education
you can not get rid of it .,education
you can not hate it to go away .,education
you can not shame it away .,education
you can not guilt it away .,education
it ha to be engaged in a higher service .,education
i impacting others helping others improving your own life improving the life of others .,education
because when it is engaged then it becomes purified .,education
because if you ignore it it will stay there .,education
and if you try and push it away it is going to push back .,education
it is a strong way .,education
but if you engage and go yeah what ?,education
but i am going to use that tendency to try and help this people out of this person do this .,education
thats the only way that it start to be purified .,education
and that that resonates very strongly .,education
the other one i want to tell u wa whats the lesson you have to learn the hard way ?,education
i think the one thats been the most potent for a long time is you can not do it all on your own .,education
for me i do not think i wa able to trust people for a very long time .,education
i went to a therapist one time and he had said yeah youve been neglected .,education
and i wa no i havent been neglected .,education
i had food water shelter clothing all these thing .,education
he wa no you were emotionally neglected from your father .,education
and i wa my god ring true .,education
but what happened wa i had developed this feeling over my lifetime of ive got to do it alone .,education
i can not trust anybody .,education
there were time in my dad would even though he wa an amazing person .,education
i always tell people i wa i am grateful that i had the father that i had .,education
he wa he never beat me .,education
he never touched me inappropriately .,education
he would get drunk and fall asleep .,education
and when he fell asleep hed forget about me in a lot of different way ?,education
there wa that neglect of he would say i am going to come pick you up and we are going to go fishing .,education
because i have to florida .,education
and would sit on the front porch for an hour two hour of my fish and pull and he would never show up ?,education
and there were the aspect of that .,education
and i think somewhere along the line i developed this feeling of no one going to help me .,education
i have to do it all in my own which there a piece of that which there is some truth ?,education
i do have to sometimes step forward and be the person to do it .,education
but for the longest time i never understood the phrase no man is an island .,education
because i wa i have done everything by myself .,education
and then i started looking around me and i wa no i havent .,education
the universe is always been there giving me everything that i need in every person to help me in some way and proving it better .,education
and a everythings grown the podcast ha grown my my company ha grown all this stuff .,education
we have thirty people on the team i can not do it on my own .,education
i can not help people on my own the way that i wish that i could .,education
if i wa i am not thirty people .,education
i do not have thirty day .,education
they can get done and we can get done in one day that i could get done in an entire month .,education
and it is been big for me is trusting people to be able to help me and to be able to ask for help .,education
whether that be in a business but also going to my wife and be hey i am struggling now .,education
can you talk to me for a few minute ?,education
and knowing that she doesnt think he not man enough which is a fear that i had if i go to her with my problem shes going to be he not man enough .,education
but for her to be yeah let me hold space for you .,education
and i think the biggest thing for me is is learning that i can not do it all in my own .,education
it is to it is strength to ask for help .,education
it is strong task for help .,education
and and that i need to be better at asking for help when i do need it .,education
thats a great one .,education
thats a great one .,education
i can relate to it in many way .,education
and yeah it strike a chord for sure .,education
and i think many of u both of those question think about it .,education
whats taken whats the lesson you learned the hard way and whats the lesson you wish to learn earlier ?,education
and write them down because you might forget it .,education
and you fold back in that cycle often .,education
rob we end every on purpose episode with a final five. . these question have to be answered in one word to one sentence maximum .,education
thats it .,education
ill do my best .,education
rob these are your final five .,education
the first question is what is the best advice youve ever had or received ?,education
ill give you the sentence .,education
and if you want me explain it i can .,education
but everything is your fault .,education
yeah you can explain everything is your fault come back to you with a ceo of your life .,education
i my very first mentor that i had i paid five hundred a month to have my first coach when i wa nineteen about it is two thousand and twenty .,education
and we worked together for two year .,education
we had some great call .,education
i do not remember any of them .,education
and what it wa wa i had made many excuse a to why i wa late to call .,education
why i did not hit my assignment .,education
why i did not do what i needed to do .,education
and he had this tough conversation .,education
he said rob if a business succeeds whose fault is it ?,education
and i wa what do you mean ?,education
he if a business succeeds all one thousand employee move into the direction they have a successful year whose fault is it that the person who orchestrated i wa the ceo he said if a business fails whose fault is it ?,education
and a the ceo he said rob if you get to the end of your life and it is not what you wanted it to be .,education
and you did not create the life that you wanted to make the money you wanted to have to success the love of happiness travel place that you wanted to whose fault would it be ?,education
and he said if you did create the life that you wanted to you had the love of happiness the abundance everything that you wanted whose fault would that be ?,education
and i said it would be my fault .,education
and he said the problem with you is you are treating this life a if you are the victim .,education
and what you need to realize that everything that happens to you is you are fault and that your life will not change until you decide that you want to be the ceo of your life .,education
i do not know how that would have felt when you had it at that point .,education
yeah exactly .,education
with that mindset and i think a lot of people today would find that offensive they might get hurt by it .,education
they might what how did you transfer that energy to be no this is helpful .,education
it is not hurtful .,education
i wa a little bit hurt but there i felt truth .,education
because when i look at the path of where my life wa going to go had i continued to blame everybody else ?,education
it wasnt going to be good .,education
but when i looked at people who i knew who took full ownership of their life one of my probably my first mentor without even being on purpose wa my uncle dan who wa an incredibly successful guy .,education
how to bunch of success but also is incredibly giving always still loving .,education
and he never blamed anybody else for when his business failed and he brought it back from from nothing and rebuilt it .,education
he wa always there for everyone else .,education
but he always took everything a his responsibility .,education
and it is not everything thats happened to you in your life is your fault .,education
but whatever it is that you have a your responsibility to work through .,education
smith also said this ?,education
where it is it is not my fault that my father wa an alcoholic .,education
but it is my responsibility to do with what do with it because it is a reality that i have .,education
and i have to work through those thing .,education
and for me it wa it rang true where i wa i wa it is .,education
and if my life is going to change i have to be the person to change it .,education
and thats when it clicked for me .,education
that conversation i could say is absolutely one hundred .,education
the one conversation that changed my life completely .,education
what is the worst advice you ever had or received ?,education
fidden with everybody else .,education
a question number three what is your most repeated door ?,education

something that you practice .,education
meditation of the artwork .,education

fift and final question .,education
if you could create one law that everyone in the world had to follow what would it be ?,education
one law that everybody in the world ha to follow .,education
to take five minute every single day to practice selfawareness .,education
i think that every problem in this world could be solved if people were more selfaware .,education
i think that all of our problem come from lack of selfawareness .,education
and if people were more aware of our action politician were more aware of their action and how it is affecting the entire world .,education
and if parent were aware of how their action are affecting their child .,education
a a son if i am aware of how my action are affecting my mom my sister my wife everybody around me .,education
if we could take five minute to practice being more selfaware i think that the entire world would be better .,education

welcome to this episode of the informal economy health and education podcast .,education
your enter is each item .,education
this episode i am joined here by city of obeil communication officer the national council .,education
welcome back .,education
thank you very much .,education
it is been quite a pleasure to meet you .,education
also joining u is city puewe when you are sitting here it is about obeil the assistant director of the city of obeil .,education
thank you .,education
and we are also joined by yohem emezi our youth informal trader from obeil .,education
thank you much .,education
to get them more rolling they were talking about highlyconservations .,education
they are important to the sector we consider the same that is the youth the resident the tutubi era the year to highlight how they walk through this process .,education
maybe you start by asking me what are the key highlight of the puewe twenty fourmage review and how will you impact business in the way ?,education
thank you very much .,education
excited to ask you about the activity .,education
a a local operator it is been very much a year our puewe twenty fourmage review .,education
first of all we are very excited about the response of the people who are teammate to ask if you can help u to get feedback on how we are performing a a local authority .,education
and the key highlight is that people are talking about the improved water that supply since improved it food for the people and improved revenue collection .,education
they are also talking about the initial frequenting of the one before the rain .,education
a a local authority we are very much happy and the major highlight wa the acquisition of our critical equipment much of the u.s. in the country .,education
we believe that this will impact business in spite of ensuring that people provide them with the service that they want all the time for example the water ensuring that there is proper sanitation proper health care and ensuring that the infrastructure is in order .,education
a a local authority we believe that we have much of the feedback that we got from the business association and the stakeholder at large .,education
it ha helped u to ensure that when we look at the footprint from the budget we share it in line with what the people want a the business authority .,education
if i can add any question of trust policy and accountability in this process what measure have been taken to ensure trust policy and accountability in the budgeting process ?,education
in the budgeting process for u to be transparent we should ensure that we update the budget approach which we always do and ensure that we also update the financial statement .,education
we always ensure that when it come to budget issue we will transfer it from day one .,education
for example we invite everyone who is supposed to be inputting in the budget from the review .,education
if you have realized what i said before we say that we invite everyone for the stakeholder to come and input and we also ensure that those who can not come easily can also participate using the eplatforms .,education
thats the way we try to ensure that we transfer it from all transfer it from all mean to all public meeting .,education
everything is covered even when we did the review we managed to ensure that it wa published on social medium platform .,education
we also included everybody what the president of the public is saying that we move you with the match of ensuring that if everyone is inputted no one is left behind .,education
it also incorporated sign language in every language that even those who can not work even those who can not not hear who understand what we are doing .,education
and talking of engagement the eplatforms the social medium platform how do we cancel engaging with the resident and stakeholder in the two thousand and twenty budgeting process ?,education
and we are also going to be having eplaces and ecookies also participate in live voting in not taking public meeting .,education
evolving resits i think this is a little bit good to give u the possibility how we are participating in those thing and what change do we expect in this year process ?,education
i think a a homeless we need to appreciate our local authority in term of how they are trying to do their budget consultation .,education
there ha been a very serious difference from the way that they used to do their budget consultation particularly the budget formulation because budget on it own is not an event but it is a process .,education
but now that we are also engaged in term of budget review it is good to u to our local authority .,education
but now we inputted from the very first and we also reviewed the budget .,education
that mean that it give u confidence in term of where we are going a a local authority .,education
we appreciate that .,education
we will continue engaging .,education
we have been put in a far a education and health is concerned .,education
we are pleased to note that in two thousand and twentytwenty four by two thousand and twentytwenty four by two thousand and twenty we took the budget review .,education
we were talking about the issue to do with increasing school .,education
we were talking about issue to do with having health facility taming the offsale bar into a clinic having a new site in term of coming up with a mother school in koba eighteen .,education
these are real serious issue that we are advocating for in the agreement .,education
the inclusion of pwds .,education
we are advocating for that in the entire community .,education
we are saying we have been intact and we are here .,education
you are going to ask me to take a peek to ask you again to say a you feel if you participated in the pilot consultation before maybe next time let say it will not happen .,education
and what are the feeling that you feel are part of the process ? .,education
i think i will start with the national part of it because it draw from that aspect .,education
and i would to appreciate the government for being inclusive and making sure the marginalized community is involved .,education
but however a in formal trade we felt that it wa a rushed process .,education
one week it wa such a little time when we were talking about the national budget pilot consultation and we felt that the time given wa competing with our business .,education
you could calculate going to koepe or fuma and the impact it would have on your business .,education
we ended up choosing our household and assuming that those who are being who may be talking on behalf coming back to the local authority would also to appreciate what the city council is doing .,education
but it seems much significant improvement in trying to be inclusive and they are in way inclusive .,education
but yeah far we have been trying to start the local bioprocesses .,education
and from the previous experience yeah we hope mr. paragasio wa saying that they are not being inclusive the eplatforms the doortodoor session that they are going to .,education
a a few minute about it what do you want to see included in the package particularly in regard to marketplace and other education ?,education
in term of marketplace we wish to have more place allocated for u because take for example the catered mouse that is happening in our local authority it is not something that is safe for human .,education
all the time woman are running and the car they are at it very risk .,education
and also it spray the resource from the part of the local authority using fuel main power and everything .,education
i think this budget should ensure that maybe more place are allocated with adequate facility that are needed .,education
in term of health i would appreciate if we have a maintenance award in the area of sanam koba we want in koba one year maintenance award to be resuscitated that it is not overwhelmed .,education
in term of school the same is mentioned the sector ha gone massively with we are extending the fire and fire and we do need school .,education
if we can make you what you promote a i say how can you support qe by promoting it a you build a particular example of an existing market in changing space ?,education
thank you very much .,education
i am very excited about what you said and i am looking at here which is a very young case .,education
id to encourage the youth to also attend these budget consultation meeting and also encourage the trade u to attend these budget consultation meeting because if you do not attend no one is going to come and speak and be a part of you .,education
in the hustling if you do not go on the hustling ground no one is going to hustle for you .,education
the same applies with attending budget consultation meeting .,education
you should come and do that .,education
if you can not come and attend these budget consultation meeting you also encourage the youth to attend the yes sir .,education
what if we plan for a formal tradeoff ?,education
if we plan for a formal tradeoff we are looking at the revamping of mutapa market .,education
it is something that weve planned .,education
if you are saying that the master plan we also need to be at every event well be telling you about the master plan .,education
it is in the master plan when we say that we need to consider informal trader we need to consider trader in the city of kiru and ensure that they have place that are habitable ensure that they have decent trading space .,education
for u we want to develop it to be a hub of marketing but it should be healthy it should be decent .,education
thats one .,education
we are also looking at ip market .,education
it is almost it is ninety complete .,education
we are also looking at for my market it is eighty five complete .,education
we are hoping that by the year two thousand and twenty five well be talking about these percentage but we are excited that weve done something .,education
and we are also looking at different area where the informal trader are coming from from the one .,education
and i think that in essence you do not need to come in haseulita .,education
you can do it where you stay because thats where the people are .,education
a a local authority this is some of the thing that we are looking at in the year two thousand and twenty five .,education
we need to set up space for informal trader in the area that they stay in back at their home because thats where the people are staying .,education
the size of the informal trader the way they choose to live what are the most specific need and priority ?,education
what is the degree and how can they catch on this in the future ? .,education
thank you very much itai .,education
this is water .,education
we can not run away from that .,education
they want water .,education
if you can talk about everything in here but immediately that they want is water .,education
and a a local authority it is our number one priority .,education
we always laugh when we have meeting to say that engineer in the land of the city water land of the city or water .,education
we are looking at the entire system from the point when someone open their tap and get water .,education
we need to leave them all of that .,education
we have our engineer they are looking into best way of ensuring that we improve .,education
far if we notice we have improved we have been pumping water from thirty.eight megalitres to around fifty eight time sixty megalitres per day which is good for u . we want to continue improving the water supply in the city .,education
also ensuring that water reach the place that it ha not been reaching .,education
for example in richmond we have challenge in cobra nineteen we have challenge .,education
we are not quiet a a local authority .,education
these are thing that we keep on looking at and trying to find solution to it .,education
trying to see how best we can give water .,education
we are seeing in two thousand and twenty five we do not quite end excuse .,education
then the other thing in term of engagement what we need to see them improving on is the issue to do with thematic committee leading to budget .,education
yes we have been together in term of budget review which is correct .,education
we have been together in term of putting into the budget which is .,education
but we also then need thematic committee thematic committee which will then speak to sectorspecific issue .,education
she said she is in the informal sector .,education
they are the only people who can better explain the challenge that they are meeting .,education
if you are going to formulate a thematic committee that speaks to the informal sector then it make sense .,education
i think by and large what our local authority need to improve is communication .,education
yes they have done that sending message on whatsapp platform sending message on their website they also have facebook pay .,education
they are trying to do that but in term of those that are new to social medium we then need to find a way of making sure that they have to pas it .,education
i think effective communication is one area that you might need to improve on .,education
because yes on social medium we are very effective .,education
i think our pr department is one of the best in the country but are we reaching all the number of people that are not in person but we need to take away .,education
i think in term of communication they can do that .,education
moving on to your question how do you think camp are facilitated for the most in the transmaritime budgeting process ?,education
and not only the regulatory but you can also speak to mr. likue here to say that there is a risk of selection .,education
how do they need to push that maybe people are able to attend these issue of floating out or i do not know if each of you improved .,education
if it improved whats your take on it ?,education
i am thinking i appreciate the online platform in accepting technology but sometimes i think we have to go back home because the informal trader are enixed back .,education
and sometimes they use mailing in person with disability hearing impairment .,education
if you use mailing to them they are not being communicated with .,education
we need to ensure that all those proper structure that queer city council ensure that the word have the word committee are put to good use to ensure that thing are not running and everyone is involved .,education
sometimes we are assuming that maybe the municipality police will not have been informed but they do not know .,education
this can only be addressed if we have a gender based .,education
and coming back to you mr. selypio yes now the boy is in your hand water is improved and everything is the noise is down a bit .,education
the honour is now to you to help encourage the resident to now honour that council can also operate smoothly .,education
thank you .,education
may i invite all the gbvs what solid promise are you going to give now to the resident of queer city council ?,education
thank you for having u . whats new ?,education
we are looking at helping the two thousand and twenty five material world if it is coming up .,education
we are trying to find a way to set it to be coming up in the two thousand and twenty five budget .,education
i can not promise anything for the two thousand and twenty five budget .,education
the budget belongs to the people of queer .,education
the people of queer make the budget .,education
they should come and make the budget .,education
they should come and make it happen .,education
queer who belongs to the people of queer .,education
we can not do anything without the people of the city of queer .,education
whatever they want u to do is exactly what we will do a a local authority .,education
where we face challenge they should also come up and say you are facing this challenge maybe we can help with this .,education
i am happy about the reason the social medium and the city of queer .,education
they always come up to the local authority to say but you can fix this this way .,education
it is always good when we have all those idea to help improve the city of queer .,education
thank you very much .,education
there you have it people of queer .,education
in two thousand and twenty three we want to see improved participation in the next day for being here with u . and i think it is time to talk to the people of queer from queer perspective .,education
thank you very much .,education

and that is dutch .,education
i think i knew that a while ago .,education
lindsay and i met about a year and a half ago .,education
we discovered this wonderful site that i do not know if it is a good thing i discovered it because ive been a frequent customer since then but i am thrilled that big sky life book is in existence .,education
and why do not you share with the audience how you made the move from fifteen year in state politics to running this wholesome beautiful online bookstore for child ?,education
yeah absolutely .,education
thank you much for having me .,education
i think i had my first child and i went through a legislative session leaving him and decided to step away from that and focus on my kid .,education
now we have three .,education
and with the child came a lot more book and the love of reading my kid .,education
and i also married somebody who love going to bookstore used bookstore .,education
we do not have very many new bookstore anymore .,education
we would go to these used bookstore and i wa looking in the childrens section and you saw all of these agenda being pushed specifically barnes noble and chapter .,education
i know there are good book corduroy curious george all the great vintage favorite but you couldnt find them .,education
and it wa it wa discouraging .,education
and i also talked to some elderly friend who wanted to buy book for their grandkids and they did not have a bookstore to go thumb through them and you shop online and you do not know whats whats beneath that cover .,education
i i had a dream a couple of year ago and i dreamt what if we had a room or an online store where everything wa preread everything wa wholesome .,education
people could trust anything in there .,education
and you could judge a book by it cover .,education
and if it looked pretty you knew it wa wholesome on the inside .,education
and i had this dream and i woke up and told my husband and he said let do it .,education
let build an online childrens bookstore and he the tech behind all of it .,education
hundred of hour have gone into it but it is been a joy .,education
and people have a source they can go to that they can trust everything in there .,education
and thats been fun to be able to provide that .,education
yeah ive seen your video of you packing these book and i it is weird .,education
i sit there and watch it because i love watching what book did they order ?,education
it is in your room your storehouse of the book is amazing .,education
when we met about a year and a half ago you were getting off the ground .,education
but ive watched your the the market for what you are you are selling explode over the last year and a half .,education
i know people who are thankful for it and ive watched it explode .,education
talk a little bit about when you first started and where you are today and how thats very different .,education
my goodness .,education
i remember when we launched the business and we had a friend over and we got that first shop of iding .,education
i got an order and it wa my friend who wa saying that that wa our first customer which is such a gift .,education
and friend and family were supportive .,education
but i remember when it wa the first order from someone i had never met .,education
and now order come through every day and it is much fun to see what people have put picked out from our site .,education
it is it is fun every time you get an order and what did they choose ?,education
and you get to pack it up .,education
but along the way it ha been a lot of work .,education
it is also hard to navigate google and being able to rank .,education
if someone put in wholesome book for child we pop up .,education
my husband worked hard on that that we have seo worked out and we are showing up .,education
and there been many people with platform that have also shared about u to help spread the word .,education
i think thats been the biggest gift people that have been excited about it you all and shared about it .,education
and that ha spurred on the growth to where we are now .,education
and we i think we celebrated two year two year .,education
yeah it is been a lot of work but it is been a lot of fun .,education
now we order book from fifty might be more than fifty now different publisher .,education
and i think we are around eight hundred book in our shop .,education
we also started with collection .,education
my biggest thing wa i would see book blogger they would have a thanksgiving collection or a christmas collection .,education
and it wa all wholesome .,education
and i would click on it to buy it and it would take me to amazon .,education
and i wa i do not i love this collection .,education
initially we started with collection .,education
i think we had about forty five collection .,education
and then the demand wa there to buy them individually .,education
we now offer the collection still because i love the one we put together .,education
but you can also order all of them individually a . and no i love your collection a a teacher .,education
if if you are focusing on one particular thing i loved you had a patriotic collection .,education
and i wa able to incorporate that into my classroom .,education
but then some of your collection are about certain characteristic honesty courage .,education
i love the courage collection .,education
thats you have one on inventor and scientist .,education
i love the collection .,education
and of course if anybody is giving a gift for baby youve got lot of great collection for baby too .,education
they are much fun .,education
yeah doing the character trait wa exciting for u . i do not know of another bookstore that sort their book by character trait .,education
and i think reading book on courage and perseverance and integrity and instilling those value a the child reading about them .,education
it wa important for u . and it ha been a big hit with our with our audience a . yeah .,education
and you have story about real people .,education
many of your book are are nonfiction .,education
and they are real people who exemplified courage .,education
and and then we were talking before about the scientist that you have on there .,education
granted in one of the collection there it is a mouse telling the story but it is telling the true story of this real person who followed their curiosity to to discover certain thing that we are very thankful for today .,education
and then you you start when we first met you were catering to baby and younger child and then elementary .,education
but since then youve branched out .,education
you now have book that are nine to twelve year old maybe middle school range .,education
can you talk about some of those ?,education
and i do have several of those .,education
we were at twenty twenty chapter book on our site now with more being added every month .,education
but this one snow treasure is a hit from my childhood .,education
it is a true story of courage .,education
and i think it is for all age .,education
but then if a child wa reading it themselves then you would get into the eight to twelve year old range .,education
and then we added this one which i am sure nobody will know about because it is brand new .,education
sure hope is for age twelve on up .,education
and adult i read this book .,education
it wa incredible .,education
it wa major crime major laugh faith in family and value are interwoven through the entire story .,education
it is a fabulous book .,education
that one age twelve and up but it would be a great read if you read it with your kid if you had mature ten to twelve year old a . yeah .,education
and of course where the red burn grows is a great one for all age .,education
we let great until you get to the end .,education
i know we have some vintage favorite .,education
i love the whole thing with this is we do not need to recreate the wheel .,education
there are many great wholesome book that are already written .,education
i want to pull those in .,education
thats reassuring for parent because a a their kid get older i have four kid who were voracious reader throughout their entire .,education
and at any given time they could have four different huge chapter book .,education
there wa no way in the world that i could vet everything they were reading and know that it wa all good and wholesome .,education
that is an incredible thing for parent to know that they can order book for their preteen or teen from your website .,education
eventually youll have more and then and trust that that they are not going to run into any contentious material in there that this shirt some of the book are going to be sad .,education
there might be book about war that thing but we are not going to be pushing an agenda in some of those book .,education
i wa listening to a podcast last week and there wa it wa a podcast about classic .,education
and they talked about the reason that they are classic is because theyve been stress tested over time .,education
and thats what make them classic .,education
and when i think about some of the book where the red fern grows or little house on the prairie even granted those are not maybe a stress tested over such a period of time .,education
but they are the if you present one of those book to someone today an adult today they are going to fondly remember those book from their childhood and know that it wa worth reading and they would read it again a an adult .,education
ive probably read charlotte web now a dozen time to different group of student and every time i am this is the best book ever .,education
it is .,education
i do not we do not need to reinvent the wheel necessary .,education
and there are story worth reading and retelling to to child today and and letting them experience that .,education
thats thats exciting that you are branching off into that .,education
and i know youll have your work cut out for you because it is harder to screen chapter book than it is picture book .,education
i know weve had such a such a demand for it .,education
people are clamoring for the chapter book .,education
we are also going to be releasing all the missionary biography christian hero then and now those will be coming to our shop .,education
yeah a lot of them coming down the pipeline .,education
stay tuned .,education
i do not want to put you on the spot but i would love to know because weve gotten this question from parent teacher a a school leader about alternative book fair vendor .,education
and i am thinking about the book that you offer .,education
you have some faith based book you have some secular book you have some a little bit for everything .,education
do yourself somewhere down the road offering that a an option for school ?,education
wow i havent asked .,education
i havent asked this question .,education
and i think now there are some good option .,education
i havent taken a deep dive into them but i know there a couple of good option for scholastic book fair alternative for me to do that .,education
it would you are buying massive quantity from the publisher in order to get a discount enough to do the book fair .,education
there more logistics involved .,education
i have wanted to in the old day when scholastic would have that thin paper booklet that you could circle what you wanted .,education
i wanted to put all of our book in i guess not all but a lot of our book and one of those that people can flip through and see what we have .,education
i thought thatd be much fun .,education
book fair i do not know .,education
i think i would i would probably first do a deep dive into the one that are doing it currently and see .,education
but i also i have talked to a couple of school to see how we can do an alternative .,education
maybe provide a source for the librarian to be purchasing book for their library noting that everything is preread and vetted .,education
i think to start we are working with some library to do that .,education
we already have some library that purchase from u . that might be our first step towards that book fair .,education
thats thats quite entertaining .,education
i am planting a seed because i certainly would love to one day when i have grandchild who go to a book fair i would love for them to have those book there to buy .,education
and you are talking about the school book fair ?,education
but i love that you are working with library and that they are refilling their shelf with with book from from you .,education
one of the thing for our audience maybe if you do not know we have hosted a good book drive where we raised money and were able to send wholesome book bundle to classroom all across the country .,education
and we were able to raise about ten thousand dollar which meant lot of book going into classroom .,education
the teacher were absolutely thrilled to receive these book .,education
and one of the elementary school that we sent a bundle to and we sent big skylife book to them i wa told that this school wa a book desert .,education
and that broke my heart because i am thinking i bet every student probably ha a chromebook or an ipad that they are on but they are they are missing out on book .,education
and i do not know if parent understand how many good book have been discarded .,education
and i use that word on purpose because you can open up the flap of the book and see the word discard off of the shelf .,education
and theyve ushered in ipads or chromebooks and have tossed out .,education
i would encourage parent to recommend people big skylife book a hey we need to refill our shelf .,education
let look to big skylife book and we can trust that they are going to be good wholesome book that we do not have to worry about any agenda being pushed or inappropriate material popping up that we did not know wa in there .,education
i hope parent and any teacher that are listening will know this is a good opportunity if they are needing to restock their empty bookshelf .,education
but that wa much fun last year .,education
we we sent many book bundle all over the country .,education
and that wa such a gift for me to be able to send them and then for you all to raise the money to get them to the school .,education
that wa incredible .,education
and seeing the picture also of them being delivered and the kid reading them .,education
and it is also there might not be inappropriate content in our book but there also much rich value in them .,education
when the kid are reading them it is not fluff .,education
it is they are learning about great explorer or they are learning about courage and these character trait are automatically being instilled in these kid through these incredible story that theyll remember .,education
and i love i love that we are able to get our book through you all into the school .,education
it is fantastic .,education
and we are we are planning on doing it again this year .,education
and we are hoping to double the number of bundle that go out .,education
thats the goal .,education
if anybodys listening and want to write u a check know that the money is going to good use and the teacher were appreciative .,education
we went to denver colorado to a teacher summit this summer .,education
and we got to meet a couple of the teacher who were recipient of the bundle .,education
and they were they were thanking me .,education
i am the book did not come for me and the money did not come for me .,education
but you are very welcome because what a wonderful thing to send .,education
they were appreciative .,education
but it is funny that you say that these are wonderful book that that these student will remember the lesson that they learn in there .,education
because at that summit we had a display of a wholesome book bundle from big sky life book .,education
it wa one .,education
and i think poky little puppy wa in there .,education
big and your fancy .,education
there were there were a couple of i think we had about five book up there .,education
the reaction of the teacher coming to our table and seeing these book that they remembered from their childhood wa priceless .,education
and it is think about that .,education
think about how much these book mean to you today a a whole grown adult some of them not that young .,education
and think about how thats going to impact these childrens day to read that .,education
and those are the book that we need to be putting into the hand of child .,education
and thats why i am glad that we partnered with big sky life book and are able to send book that that you are selling that into these classroom .,education
it may be the only place that some of these child experienced these beautiful story .,education
it is true that we sent book to one city here in montana through you all .,education
and the student there ninety nine percent of them are below the poverty line .,education
and they do not have a bookshelf full of amazing book at home .,education
they do not even have food .,education
they are not even getting lunch dinner breakfast at home .,education
but we were able to through you all to send these book to their classroom that they are going to see these rich story in the classroom at their school .,education
that wa that wa neat to see the picture of these kid cherishing these book .,education
and you talk about wanting to put all your book in a in a paper a scholastic thing because thats how they did that .,education
and and i think that putting the book in their hand not saying open up that app and read that book but they get to they get to turn the page .,education
they get to go back and look at that picture of the pokey little puppy that they want to see again .,education
and they it is it is the whole experience is something that theyll remember forever .,education
and i love that that we are able to do that together .,education
and again maybe there somebody in the audience wanted to support this and it would be fantastic .,education

it is fun to reminisce about those wonderful book .,education
and then also you have a lot of book on there that i am one of my favorite book that i got wa tiktok bannockers clock .,education
that one tell the audience about that one because that wa one that wa very new to me .,education
and it introduced me to someone that i should have known about and did not .,education
yeah now it is been a while since i read it but we sell a lot of that book and it is bannocker .,education
he want to build a clock and he ha nothing .,education
and through the book he us whatever material he ha and he draw out what he would do and then carves it out .,education
and it take him year and then it doesnt work .,education
youve got perseverance and someone who did not quit until the very end .,education
and he created himself .,education
but i think that character trait in that book are patience because he wa patient and the trial and error it took to observe what he wanted to create .,education
i think he borrowed a watch from someone and then took it all apart and then wa able to put it all back together and return it .,education
but the perseverance and the observation we have a character trait of observation observant .,education
that played a role .,education
and that wa a neat story a true story .,education
but inadvertently you are instilling these great character trait in your kid through the reading of that book .,education
and that curiosity too how doe this clock work ?,education

our education system is allterrain .,education
whether we lack it or not whether we believe it or not it is happening before our eye .,education
parent teacher listen up .,education
they are confused about the random change .,education
they are arguing and posed on them since the onset of covidnineteen .,education
teacher are leaving and drove and they are disgusted .,education
mismanaged by forcing them to learn thing .,education
they do not want to know or need to know .,education
and place they have no clue about we need direction .,education
we need question to be answered .,education
we need process and pattern that we can find a guide to .,education
and for this purpose we have educational consultant we have here tonight on the podcast .,education
thats going to tell u why .,education
it is important that not only we create masterclasses but we tailor make these class for those different school culture .,education
we have to ask the question .,education
and these question help our country developer prepare and gather all the resource .,education
they need for their masterclasses .,education
what they are being said tonight we are going to talk a little bit about how to set up when to set up a masterclass and what to expect from those masterclass course .,education
first i want to go to sandy robert .,education
sandy robert ha been a while since we have had you on the podcast .,education
last time you were on it wa amazing .,education
we got some comment .,education
what wa your thought when we get you to talk for tonight ?,education
it could not possibly be better timing .,education
this is perfect in that .,education
when you are here with i am up to now you are going to go wow her name wa out there in the ether and no wonder i picked up on that master to come tonight .,education
we are going to go to it .,education
what do you have to do ?,education
what do you have to do ?,education
what do you have to do ?,education
here what i am up to .,education
i had retired from teaching at the community college in the psychology department .,education
and before i do not covid took everything apart .,education
and that .,education
and before that ended i wa also teaching i wa teaching dual enrollment course a psych one on one in cultural psych to the college charter high school .,education
and that wa a small high school with over a hundred student .,education
and marvelous .,education
and with the best high school principal i have ever met in my entire life .,education
and that that that ended with covid .,education
that wa that fall apart .,education
i wa doing other thing after that .,education
but then in the past and not even two month a little bit more than a month .,education
and now i got a call from my high school principal guy .,education
and he had he he left where he had been with the college .,education
and his ha taken a position with a high school from the indian reservation .,education
remember we are in arizona .,education
and asked if i would come and teach some dual enrollment class for him .,education
and he would you please come out of retirement and you teach these class .,education
and he he the best principal .,education
and that that i have ever worked with .,education
and the probably what i am going to do is ill be teaching a couple of class for him .,education
second semester .,education
after the holiday break and everything .,education
and i am i am looking forward to it .,education
and i went out and spent a day after school .,education
and they were doing some event .,education
and it wa it felt comfortable .,education
it wa worth being there to help him to help the student to be involved in the community .,education
and to be able to bring different aspect of the meaning of psychology and culture et cetera .,education
and be able to work and communicate with the native american community .,education
it is i am thrilled to be doing this .,education
total pain in the neck .,education
i had to trip trip down .,education
credential and all these kind of thing .,education
where is this ?,education
and it is i am looking forward to only get started after the first two year .,education
ill teach second semester .,education
and ill teach two class that the student will try to get to see your student first since theyll be graduating .,education
and then see what we are going to do with the rest of the student .,education
but it is it is invigorating to be someplace where they want you .,education
and that is key to almost anything that we are doing .,education
i have i have dealt with school where one of my favorite story is i wa fight based at a high school in california .,education
and it wa small high school .,education
and then down the coast from san francisco .,education
and pretty isolated from the other community a far a traveling .,education
and that to get to the main peninsula where to get up to san francisco .,education
everything wa over a mountain path .,education
and it wa it wa a wonderful experience .,education
but nobody wanted to be in campus .,education
the the county wa the county driving off the hall convention wa paying for me to be on campus .,education
everything wa you have to be here .,education
and then one morning i get a call at fifty oclock in the morning from the principal .,education
and he say there been a gang fight .,education
there problem .,education
they are all fighting .,education
how fast can you get here ?,education
and that wa a major turning point .,education
i do not want somebody to have to have a crisis in order to listen .,education
but up until that moment he could see no value in and someone being there wa different kind of skill .,education
and that moment which you do not necessarily want .,education
and that it wa a turning point .,education
and that wa it wa perceived completely different after that .,education
sometimes you have to stick it out .,education
that then the bottom line is helping to use .,education
but the thing that they need the thing that they deserve to have .,education
that if someone is not advocating for them is not it ?,education
is it an adult advocating for them that they are going to miss out on ?,education
what do you think ?,education
because a lot of people may not know they could know but i know you can explain it .,education
can i explain to the listener what is dual enrollment ?,education
what doe that mean ?,education
dual enrollment mean that i am teaching a college course .,education
the same exact course that i teach at the college for college credit to high school student .,education
and they are earning college credit .,education
and i am able to go in and teach the same psychology class that i am teaching at the college and they are getting college credit .,education
if i teach two course in the spring semester after the holiday break in school and january and that there will be student who will have six college unit a they go when they graduate from high school .,education
you can see thats incredible .,education
no that is incredible .,education
and it is necessary and it is crucial and when i say it is necessary and why i say it is crucial .,education
because there is a lot of social economically disadvantaged adolescent there in school especially those public school .,education
and we got poverty there .,education
we got people that are living in a single parent house hold ?,education
and where in most case the mom ha to bring home the bacon .,education
then she ha to cook the bacon .,education
and then she ha to put the kid to bed after them eating the bacon and getting the ready and doing homework .,education
this is tiring ?,education
in most case that poverty is there and that also you have bullying ?,education
thats also there in that mix thats being dealt with .,education
now we are in this demographic we are in this area and we are dealing with many challenge ?,education
and then let throw in covidnineteen and monkey park ?,education
there much going on .,education
let me go to the body of thornton pot such change in pro .,education
we are the pot such change in pro because he ha gifted in this area he able to take complex challenge and chew on them and when he regurgates .,education
he able to section them off in a way that people can understand and they can see the way he illustrates and paint the picture .,education
but he thought what wa your thought when you got the topic for tonight ?,education
i believe that because of covid obviously we had virtual learning and we had digital learning we had in person learning for decade before covid .,education
but covid created a situation where we were forced to stop incrementally innovating and tweaking the learning process .,education
and we had to look at disruptive innovation we had to look at creating an entirely new model .,education
and the hybrid model that ha been used by a lot of the school system is the height of what i to call incremental innovation .,education
they took what they could out of each system and they put them together and some very very high level people and some people who were willing to think outside the box .,education
step up and said this is not good enough .,education
we need to tear it apart and we need to make it all together again .,education
and youve got people who looked at how we teach people and how people learn and they started creating a system that would allow u to escape age barrier escape .,education
demographic escape affluence versus nonaffluence and start treating people and educating people based on where they are now .,education
and thats what i see in the master class that ive observed and that instructor ive talked to across the country they are all saying the same thing .,education
they are tweaking different portion of their master class that they can start from the very very low end all the way to the very high end and they are reinventing education based on where the learner is not where the education system think they need to be .,education
and thats where i got out of when i used to start .,education
absolutely we thank you for that .,education
when you were talking i could not help but think about affluence how people are affluent and they come into a situation and they give a motivation to different situation that change the course of how people see thing and how people interact .,education
and you have those people that have influence that are able to naturally come into a situation not even knowing sometimes that they even have influence .,education
and people are inclined to follow every step that they make and it is that guidance .,education
and it help u become effective and become effective .,education
i would say across the board and we are living in this society now that what do you want to believe in ?,education
coming out of covidnineteen that wa a very helpless and a very hopeless .,education
i believe this is my thought .,education
and i think thats a time in our life in the world where people could not find what wa next .,education
you had some people out there that those gifted people they have influence and influence that were thinking forward .,education
yourself and sandy who who we are thinking when this is a time period this is an era and time .,education
we are going to come out of this and we need to have thing set in place that when we cross this bridge when we transition from this place .,education
we need to have something thats appropriate something thats effective and something thats necessary for the people to help build them back up .,education
and when we talk about building people back up that is not a lightweight .,education
there not a lightweight duty there not lightweight task .,education
and i believe you have to have some passion you have to have some love you got to have .,education
let me ask what do you have to have ?,education
what did you have to have ?,education
what feel your passion especially coming out of covidnineteen ?,education
because both do you have done much from from before covidnineteen to now what ha felt what is the most single thing ?,education
what is the single thing ?,education
there ha filled your passion to create .,education
that would be my first question across the board .,education
this is the panel open .,education
who want to take their first ?,education
when you were saying that what came to my mind is these thing that ha worked the best for me and for the school for the past all the way back to .,education
i would say twenty some year at least .,education
and that is that there need to be and for me a far a i am concerned that .,education
and that there ha to be this in every school and that if they are going to make some progress we need peer program .,education
we need the student teaching each other .,education
they need to i do not usually sorry promote my website .,education
but if you go to my website sandyrowrits.com there a whole thing on peer counseling program and that and that student student and the student turn teen middle school etc .,education
they turn to each other long before thats all apparent whats wrong ?,education
and they are within the scope of the peer counseling program are adult who can help bridge that and who can help them be able to talk to their parent .,education
otherwise otherwise you have tragedy and that serious tragedy suicidal tragedy .,education
the other piece is within the framework of how i am at buddy and that is calcic resolution .,education
and that when these kid know how to help themselves in each other through what i would call basic mental health emotional health etc .,education
with the peer counseling then they need to know how to resolve conflict .,education
and when they need when they are able to help each other get past the difficult time and know how to sit down and to start to be able to in a positive way the personalized something that they can deconstruct it and build it up stronger .,education
and those two avenue are what do you think buddy ?,education
i couldnt agree more .,education
the two thing that kid need to know that they can build competency is the two thing that drive them on the genetic level .,education
there no such thing a a teenager who doesnt want socialization .,education
and there only one thing that they fear in socialization is that is that it is going to become an outcast or be ostracized .,education
if they do not learn a how to become relational and b you learn how to handle conflict a it emerges that they do not become ostracized .,education
and then they they are not meeting their need and every teenager every child for say age ten eleven all the way into the early 20 face that dynamic .,education
it is it is not something that we should be debating about .,education
it is something that there should be consensus about and we should plan everything around that dynamic .,education
yes and it would end up happening is they say no we need to do this other branch of english nine hundred and seventy eight and a half and the heck with the social competency skill .,education
and i know i saw harsh on that but sometimes if they do not take the time to help the person build the person and address the internal thing that they have going on and whatevers happening is home .,education
i want to add one thing to that too when you start looking at the difference between affluent and not affluent population .,education
the affluent population are not necessarily benefited by because they are entitled and they have access to a larger amount of resource .,education
that handicap them in some circumstance and ill give you the reason i say that there a continuum for all kind of behavior .,education
and when we have the gift of technology and we have the gift to be able to grab our smartphone and look up anything .,education
how important is it to learn some of the raw basic skill that are being taught in school core knowledge .,education
but now go to the other extreme because if it is good on running and it ha to also be good on the other if .,education
if you were to all of a sudden go into the forest with the mosco pirotry and the amazon .,education
i have absolutely no clue what a smartphone is who look for turtle egg and thats what they is their main diet and they they look at modern man a if we are a bunch of lazy and consider it can not do anything people .,education
if you sent our normal teenager into that environment they would be a baby without a diaper .,education
they wouldnt be able to function whatsoever .,education
but if they had relationship skill and they understood how to observe and learn and adapt and avoid conflict they could survive .,education
there no other skill that we can teach these kid that if we were all a sudden bombed about back to the stone age out because of some crazy war that happens .,education
the one who can not adapt and have those skill will not survive .,education
the only survivor will be the one who embrace outrace to press a crossing and understand the power of being relationship .,education
what you said wa profound and you talked about culture and for those who listen culture for me simply is a way of life .,education
a way of life for people how people live thats their way of life .,education
and being observing being observing meaning i am watching how this person life and i respect the way they live .,education
we are doing the anti bullying campaign but we also have an anti bullying course and one of the survey question that we ask is the dis training teach you to take action by helping the victim .,education
because we want to know if they understand what it mean to help someone that need help this is very important another question we ask in the survey is .,education
the survey or the dis training teach you to take action by shifting the focus and redirecting the bully away from the victim and these are some question that we ask .,education
our participant or our student that go through these training because this is how we design our course i wa bullied a a child .,education
and thats why i developed this anti bullying course that this anti bullying campaign because i learned a lot of i got a lot of tool on how to manage bullying let me answer the question and open up the panel .,education
how did you start your first master class course who want to take the first .,education
when i wa trying to decide how to take the information that i believe that would be beneficial when i pivoted from my larger career to my second life .,education
american are not supposed to have a second or a third act and i think seeing it and i are both probably on our third or four ha that that get blown out of the water .,education
but what i wanted to look at wa what would be the outcome and is the outcome relevant to the receiver .,education
and is the topic something that the instructor can have passion about .,education
because whats missing in education is the passionate teacher the role model the passionate role model because .,education
if you do not have passion about a topic you are only going to teach wrote information and you may not even be able to test some of the nuance of the topic .,education
but if you have passion about the topic .,education
then you can create an overwhelming picasso course that master course that will hit a lot of the high point and the low point .,education
and you build a library of answer that you may not have had at some of your student or someone may have had you have to build it that it is on the directional you are not disseminating information .,education
and you have to be willing to adapt to incoming and new information and the more knowledgeable other .,education
there someone take a class and they go i think you have that wrong and they are you have to number one admitted to included in the next version of the course and keep adapting .,education
education is not static which is one of the biggest problem in the american education system but thats how i do my master class .,education
but started me wa realizing that that wa the pivot point .,education
said that it stated .,education
i think that we have to loop around sometimes where the teacher sometimes where the student and it is always it is not we do not stop being the student because we have thing that we can be the teacher in .,education
i always have to be open to where is this going how all have thing changed .,education
it is always a matter of it go on and it is it is slow and then we all those of u who have been trained and who know people whove been trained and thats the handle .,education
there are tough situation they are able to help u be able to reach enough people .,education
there were many time and i am sure youve had the same thing .,education
there were many time that i would be trying to help a school or help a program or something that and it would come down to that someone would have to tell them that they had to do that .,education
they had to extract the class except the training except what i wa able to teach them .,education
or they would lose something maybe you some of their funding or something that from the county that are funding school .,education
and the state and it wa weird to have someone from the state department of education or from the county say you need to have her come and talk to your student otherwise .,education
we are we are not going to fund some of these thing that you want to do and i am absolutely call it tally wishing that that wasnt the case that that there were more of the one that would say .,education
of course think having to come and talk to them about some of these other situation when i wa going to a classroom and talk to the student about specific prevention .,education
i would have at a certain point i would have the teacher go to the back of the room and then i would ask some question that the student were able to answer that were more .,education
topic driven question and the teacher wa supposed to be back there noticing who had their hand up who ha their hand up .,education
to answer is ha there ever been a suicide in your family do are you aware of this are you aware of how to handle a conflict would you to learn how to handle a conflict .,education
and and take a poll and be willing to do something with that but in each case it wa .,education
i happen to be fortunate to be in a progressive county in northern california and i wa fortunate that the county stood up for these thing the county wanted to see the school put in some peer program peer to peer .,education
and they were the one who would say we are going to have the statewide conference and who would to be a presenter and a couple year i took student who presented a the conference .,education
being able to have the financial and educational backing make all the difference in the world and the the school test to take responsibility for more than knowing how to add to and to .,education
we have many thing that need to be clarified we need to clarify first of all we need to clarify how do people learn .,education
people do not learn the same some people learn by singing some people learn by watching some people learn by hand on and it take those master communicator yourselves .,education
and to observe a situation and to determine this is going to fit for this these people and this group will benefit better they are going to understand why where we have to learn it this way because i have a strategy for this learning style .,education
ive developed a course thats going to give them the ability to understand different viewpoint .,education
i am going to have them improve the way they see thing .,education
if you have a course that help people to network i am going to improve their network skill .,education
if you have a course that help people talk about tough conversation i am going to help them apply not to giving them a more cohesive decision making skill .,education
and then let talk about tough conversation .,education
i feel and i could be wrong because buddy i am i am i am you are laying now because you you wrote a book and you wrote a course called tough conversation tough choice and this is your tc squared but .,education
doe tc squared work with every learning style .,education
doe it affect people the same way across the board we know people receive information differently we know people .,education
give information differently .,education
why do we need to understand learning style and why do we learn understand these learn style .,education
that we know the possibility of how people are receiving what we say .,education
no they are viewpoint .,education
what we say they are perspective .,education
what we say doesnt even matter should we even share .,education
what they think when we are teaching them .,education
or do we want to teach to the test .,education
whats your thought .,education
why do we need to why do we need to understand learning style .,education
when you said you were getting my lane yet you you jumped in there and you planted yourself on that center line .,education
let let look at one thing very important when you talk about conflict a an example .,education
and you are talking about why you need to understand learning style because conflict only ha three source .,education
especially if it is conflict in a group inspired .,education
there task oriented conflict based on perception of who doing what who not doing what .,education
there relationship oriented who who buddy enough with who who ganged up on who and then there value oriented conflict .,education
and that come from people who value the outcome or people who valued participating in the process and there there a it is infinite number of way you can paint those three different artifact but task oriented relationship oriented and value oriented are the basic origin of all conflict .,education
but now let touch that to learning style .,education
everyone always say there a visual auditory and kinesthetic learning style but that doesnt paint the whole picture .,education
the visual auditory or what we to call observational learning style .,education
kinesthetic is doing but there two different type of doing .,education
there physical doing where you are manipulating your biology to get something done and then there reading writing interactive communication .,education
and taking a conversation up the ladder with someone else that you can co learn at the same time thats another form of kinesthetic learning .,education
there four main way to learn and then there those hybrid thing that interact with all four of those main and thats logical learning .,education
thats social learning social learning .,education
it can not be done in any other way you can not do it by yourself .,education
and then the flip side of that coin you have self driven solitary learning .,education
and then what we have is naturalistic learning and thats part of child development thats part of how you get all your bias and how you get all of your opinion .,education
but those are the four main and the four hybrid type of learning .,education
but then we also have some style thing and you brought one end you said music .,education
music is a wonderful medium for some people to learn .,education
they can also learn not only information about what music doe what it brings the art the aesthetic value but they also learn that music suit the savage beast .,education
it is a calming effect .,education
it is a coping mechanism .,education
there an interpersonal learning .,education
there interpersonal learning .,education
there perspective making and perspective taking. . all these are thing that happen during human development .,education
and when you get to the end of the road and you are looking at a functional adult .,education
you have to look at the way adult learn a . adult have four basic learning style .,education
and then you are going to incorporate all of those other style .,education
because by the time you become a functional adult you may have a preferred style but you are going to incorporate all of the style .,education
but you then you separate it into matrix .,education
some people have to do thing by a mini driven system .,education
it is called step learning .,education
then there the talk about or reverse about or come to some type of consensus about .,education
and then there research where you can do it alone or in team .,education
another way to drive yourself back to that talk about scenario .,education
and then there those guy who are what i to call the super learner .,education
those are the guy who take that research in a loan or team and they pivot the other direction .,education
and they create they innovate .,education
they disrupt society .,education
and a you can see those main and those hybrid eight bunch that is in the development stage put you where you are a an adult .,education
and i think that it is a critical mission to join those two with a bridge .,education
you have to understand how those main developmental learning style become those adult style .,education
and the way you do that is you create an environment where you tell people that if you are not the expert in the room and how we define expert in the room is the person in the room with the most knowledge about the topic on the table .,education
but you should be perspective taking .,education
you should be actively listening .,education
you should be participating in asking question that you can get the information referring to such a way that you understand it .,education
because the goal is to be able to do perspective making to someone else later further down the line .,education
and what i to label that is a cocreation feedback cycle where you pivot back and forth between perspective taking and perspective making over and over and over again .,education
and the biology is simple .,education
the human brain ha over one hundred billion nerve cell .,education
there is no way any person can say i am only a visual learner .,education
thats not true .,education
you learn through every different process and the older you get the more you incorporate all those style .,education
but there ha to be a roadmap .,education
if you can not identify where someone is in the development stage and get them adapt and adopt all those other style when they become an adult they are going to be missing some component .,education
and all you have to look at today society to see where that get u . and thats why it is important to understand learning .,education
that wa high off the press .,education
lady and gentleman that wa very dirty process .,education
it is a throw .,education
listen but what you said i am going to change it up on you .,education
what you said if i put a beat to what you said it would be a rap song .,education
and i know rap ha those six patient and those rhythm .,education
it is the improv .,education
but it is hip hop. . it is hip hop .,education
it is freestyle .,education
it is improv .,education
it is improvisation .,education
man i forget all about it .,education
and i feel horrible .,education
i had a conversation with the legend george duke .,education
he wa not an musician a composer a tenor performer a film director .,education
he wa the gamut .,education
he wa a gamut .,education
he wa a prince of jazz .,education
this guy .,education
and i had a conversation with him .,education
and it wa about practice. . and he told me he said i said before you go out and play and do a set or whatever .,education
you want to call it .,education
he said do you practice the performance in your mind ?,education
and i said what ?,education
he said do you practice from a to z to performance in your mind ?,education
because if we were doing other movie this jazz composition .,education
and he said to me do you play that song in your mind ?,education
and improv do all the improvisation in your mind ?,education
before you go out and play it physically .,education
and i am beyond which i told him no i did not .,education
he said they are not learning that song .,education
because you are not utilizing all the part of your brain .,education
and here a guy that played with mile davis .,education
to create a big hand card .,education
to our cold train .,education
the list go on and on .,education
and what he telling me is what wa told to him from the master .,education
we got an unamasturated night .,education
surrey robert sandy robert .,education
sandy robert .,education
i am moving here tonight .,education
whats going on ?,education
i want to i want to i want to i want to i want to i want our basket this moment where i am being on the same pedestal with it is incredible it is incredible it is incredible .,education
it is incredible .,education
it is incredible .,education
it is incredible it is incredible .,education
it is real it is real .,education
no when buddy wa speaking thats thats where he at ?,education
and it is you got to find your leg .,education
and thats his leg thats where he at ?,education
thats his road thats his destiny .,education
and i see the sign .,education
i see the sign i see sign .,education
i would work a job and get a paycheck in two week .,education
and most of my paycheck went to jazz city .,education
it wa addiction .,education
it wa i had to get counseling .,education
it wa too much .,education
it wa too much .,education
but let me go here .,education
and improv this communication is interplay ?,education
because we are sitting i am sitting at an honest set .,education
and maybe i am on the piano ?,education
and the drummer he there or shes there ?,education
and the bass player there .,education
and the maybe it is the saxophonist there or a good guitar player .,education
and we are communicating .,education
we are all on one heat .,education
shes a music. ?,education
when the music say hey get loud .,education
when the music say go medium .,education
we have to go medium .,education
when the music say go soft .,education
we have to go soft .,education
when the music say you have to sickle paint this beat or this rhythm .,education
exactly at this point .,education
and it creates a motif .,education
or the thing .,education
we have to be there .,education
we have to communicate .,education
and the thing about music is when it is off .,education
everyone know it .,education
whereas when you are talking i believe the master they can hear when you get off .,education
miss andy .,education
whats the question ?,education
we are at least a miscommunication between people who do not have similar .,education
and i am not talking culture here but who doe not have similar value and belief .,education
what lead to that miscommunication ?,education
will these give them getting off the beat ?,education
will these give off the same she the music especially in the workplace ?,education
and them drifting off until no man land ?,education
what is going on here ?,education
please give u some wisdom and that matter .,education
there much of it that expectation of doing are often .,education
the expectation is but they are picking the wrong thing to tackle to do .,education
and if they were wanting to do a doctor or something that they know that they are going to need to commit to study etc .,education
the musician .,education
the musician is not going to open some case and automatically know how to work the instrument .,education
you can give me an incredible instrument .,education
and i open the case and i go what do i do ?,education
do i blow on it ?,education
what do i do to make it make music ?,education
i miss a lot of step along the way where we have expectation that somebody is supposed to know all these thing .,education
and we forget to inquire .,education
and that .,education
a someone said this is amazing .,education
ive had this experience with it .,education
would you to try it ?,education
and i might have to say do i blow on it ?,education
do i do something with my finger ?,education
what do i do with it ?,education
and we need to pas along these talent .,education
we need to pas along how to do thing .,education
and sometimes we get caught up and trying to manage trying to put food on the table trying to keep our relationship together that we get lost in them .,education
we get lost a a stuff .,education
and then little thing become the petty thing become huge .,education
and it is a hard place to be in but it is understandable .,education
and we are not bad for getting into those little side trip .,education
but what we do need to do is we need to look for when there someone that can help u move through it faster than if we have to figure the whole thing out on their own .,education
and then i am not musically talented .,education
i have a sister who is fabulous in musically talented .,education
and then she could play thing on the piano that you thought that she had studied for twenty year when she wa nine .,education
and that me it is i can not even play chopstick .,education
we have a group of different kind of i do not even know the name of the dance and thats everybody needed to be at the same place .,education
or a the same skill we can be a pretty boring country and everybody be doing the same thing .,education
and we need to look at that in our business in our relationship and in our school now they are busy teaching to the test and that they are not teaching the person .,education
and we have many place where we need to go back and say what are we helping the person with ?,education
what is going to help them survive and be able to utilize these skill ?,education
we are worried that weve come into a whole everythings taken away from u not given to u . and we need to get back into sharing .,education
we need to get back into how can this help more people ?,education
how can how can this help me ?,education
is that because i might be knowledgeable in one situation doesnt mean i am equally knowledgeable in another situation .,education
i where forever the teacher and the student and i think those are the thing that we have to remember .,education
we start to put pressure on someone to always be the teacher or always be the student and we give off track .,education
but but before you answer something to that let me say this real quick .,education
second robert you are loved .,education
when i say you are loved you are loved .,education
you are loved .,education
you talk when you talk about the way you dealt with communication you dealt with dimension .,education
when you dealt with it dimension dimension dimension are space dimension are environment dimension are layer dimension are our episode is an infrastructure .,education
at the panel is open i do not know but the panel is open and i can not wait to hear what buddy ha to say but when you talked about communication i heard the dimension are you open up door and different dimension and different layer .,education
buddy called it too but i can not wait to hear what buddy ha to say .,education
go ahead please i am sorry .,education
i think it is important that we pivot to someone who not here and i give him credit .,education
but when dr. larry davis ha asked about standardized test his immediate response is we do not have standardized child we do not come from standardized family we do not live in standardized environment .,education
how can standard aid is case and help these kid ?,education
and i fully agree with that .,education
but when you are looking at what lead to miscommunication and i think sandy hit it dead on when she said expectation and comfort zone is applicable .,education
people are not taught relativity .,education
because you think something is a certain way doesnt mean the person standing next to you think the same way .,education
everyone ha the to have an opinion .,education
the only thing that ha to be maintained is solid fact .,education
but the majority of what we have in the world is opinion .,education
certified or certainty about something is very difficult to prove .,education
what beer left with is the best or most applicable opinion but you have to be willing to be curious about the other person .,education
and you have to be willing to accept that because you have a value or belief about something it is not the best it is not optimal .,education
it is one of a million different way to look at that value or belief .,education
and you have to give anybody else their due to have a different opinion a different value a different belief .,education
now doe that create this harmony in term ?,education
absolutely but this harmony is how we evolve .,education
thats the one thing sandy said that i grew in meeting you up out of the mud .,education
she said that if we were all the same how boring would we be ?,education
we would be aesthetically boring .,education
i am going to tell you the teacher that i wa the most ingrained with wa an education teacher who taught english .,education
and back when i went to school when sandy went to school we were taught the classic .,education
you read mcbeth you read hamlet you read the classic .,education
but this teacher said no i got motorheads in the class .,education
if they want to bring popular mechanic to school and they want to do a report on the article from popular mechanic i am going to give them an a because it prof they know how to read comprehend and reframe and regurgitate the information .,education
and that taught me a valuable lesson very early in life that everyone is different .,education
everyone is unique everyone should have the ability to impress their teacher that they have a certain skill and it doesnt get taught in a standardized way .,education
thats important .,education
thats said .,education
and true half of my frustration in the classroom is because somebody else is telling me what i am supposed to say and i am not willing to do it .,education
and this ha yes i am a rebel .,education
but i want them to have an open opportunity to see multiple side of something .,education
and that and someone else that come along and say you need to do it .,education
and i do not know .,education
i want to say that it is first of all that i am appreciative that you brought sandy into this conversation .,education
it take decade decade to be comfortable speaking about some of the topic that sandy is a worldclass expert on the pain and anguish of having to lose a loved one out of no other reason than someone did not see something .,education
someone did not catch something .,education
when she talk about suicide and she talk about suicide prevention she always approach it from a practical position with empathy .,education
is there a reason why we can not apply that to other topic and other education sphere ?,education
even in the hard science when someone having difficulty learning something shouldnt we take the time to realize that maybe thats not their place where they need to be and we pivot them somewhere else and then give them credit for what they are good for it ?,education
thats what we need to do .,education
we can not people and say they can not do something because obviously everyone ha a skill set .,education
and i think i could never do what sandy doe at the level she doe .,education
she is fantastic about what she doe .,education
and likewise you can say that about anybody who an expert educated .,education
we are not teacher we are not educator .,education
we are learning environment facilitator .,education
they also have at least the equal education based on their learning .,education
and thats what people sandy bring to the table .,education
now let think what doe it think that wa striking me .,education
you were seeing that a i remember i wa in a biology class .,education
definitely not one of those conversation and that is in the science .,education
but there wa a there wa a gallon of class who wa having trouble taking note on suicide .,education
and if the if the teacher wa not looking at the class but wa stating on the board and talking at the same time she would have no way of knowing what he wa saying .,education
and we got into a conversation and she asked would i consider putting a carbon under my note taking and give her the copy of my raw note .,education
and i said yeah that would be great .,education
and then i saw her playing tennis .,education
and it wa my gosh it wa good .,education
i wa she wa a plus plus plus player .,education
i said i will take note and make sure that there is a legible a possible and try to capture let the professor saying .,education
and when you teach me some more about tennis .,education
and thats exactly what we did .,education
we had a nice little system of math .,education
and she beat up on the tennis court together .,education
and that and she made me a little bit of a better player at least .,education
and and i showed my note .,education
and it wa such a steel good .,education
it wa she did not have the opportunity unless someone helped her with hearing what wa going on in class .,education
and i did not have someone helping me be a little bit better on the tennis court .,education
sometimes they fall into our lap and we need to appreciate them .,education
listen this ha been another impact for night .,education
i think it is a relationship episode one and six thing .,education
listen i guess follow u . follow u . follow u . i heard .,education
i heard .,education
follow u . follow u . follow u . follow u . ive a podcast .,education
follow u . in fact the presentation on the show i guess .,education
face button .,education
i am a little bit scared of you .,education
i am a little bit scared of you .,education

eduverse pd podcast brought to you by proed education solution your onthego professional development .,education
welcome to the very first episode of the eduverse pd podcast .,education
in today episode our two ai cohosts andy and liz will explore the fascinating topic of nextgen learner .,education
theyll take a deep dive into an insightful article from eduverse newsletter fifteen titled adapting education for nextgen learner strategy and innovation written by dr. han gwin and dr. leigh dean baokwuk .,education
let jump in with andy and liz on how we can better prepare today student for tomorrow challenge .,education
hey everyone and welcome .,education
we are diving into the future of education today a topic that i think is fascinating .,education
have you heard the term nextgen learner ?,education
it is more than kid being good with tech .,education
we are talking about a generation whose brain are wired differently because of how they grew up immersed in this digital world .,education
yeah and it make you think about the term digital native ?,education
that came out back in two thousand and one .,education
and it is evolved much since then .,education
nextgen learner they are constantly connected .,education
they live and breathe the digital world .,education
and it change not what they learn but how they learn best .,education
it make you wonder how education can keep up .,education
it is a challenge for sure .,education
definitely ahead of the curve .,education
this is not about whats happening in classroom now .,education
the insight from this article written by dr. han gwin and dr. leigh dean baokwuk they can change how anyone think about learning .,education
and talk about realworld experience .,education
dr. nguyen cofounded an ai education company .,education
and dr. kwok with over twenty year in education founded proed education solution .,education
they are not theorizing here .,education
fullrate scholar ed tech ceo .,education
top voice in educational leadership even .,education
yeah theyve got the experience .,education
in this deep dive we are on a mission to uncover who these next gen learner are what make them tick and how education ha to adapt to meet their need .,education
think of it a a journey .,education
we are going to unravel the mystery of what make these learner unique .,education
and then well explore the exciting world of educational innovation that are designed for them .,education
and of course we are going to acknowledge the challenge ?,education
the uncharted territory that we are still navigating .,education
i love that analogy .,education
let start at the very beginning .,education
who are these next gen learner and what set them apart ?,education
to adapt to education we have to understand what make them tick .,education
one key difference is their relationship with technology .,education
you said it is not that they are good with tech .,education
it is that technology ha fundamentally changed how their brain work how they process information .,education
they are digital native in the truest sense of the word .,education
what else make them unique ?,education
one of the big thing is this real strong preference for personalized learning. . the old one size fit all approach it doesnt work .,education
they crave learning thats tailored to their need their interest and their pace .,education
that make sense ?,education
it is finally ditching those mass produced textbook in favor of something that is going to resonate with you .,education
how is education adapting to this need for personalization ?,education
this is where technology specifically ai is playing a huge role .,education
imagine a platform that adapts to a student learning in real time it can adjust the content the pace even the type of instruction based on their individual progress .,education
it is having a personal ai tutor .,education
thats incredible .,education
it is cool stuff .,education
but it is not about personalized learning ?,education
absolutely not .,education
another big one is their emphasis on collaboration and social learning .,education
they thrive in environment where they can learn from each other work together on project and connect with peer around the world .,education
learning from each other through platform even instagram or tiktok .,education
they are turning these platform into educational tool which is interesting to see .,education
it is .,education
it is a huge shift from that traditional individualistic approach to learning .,education
here something i find remarkable about this generation .,education
it is their awareness of global issue the sustainable development goal sdgs .,education
they are .,education
and it is amazing to see they are growing up with climate change social justice movement global interconnectedness all of it is their backdrop .,education
it is no wonder that they are passionate about making a difference .,education
but how doe this global awareness tie into their learning ?,education
it shape their worldview .,education
it motivates them to find solution to real world problem .,education
they are not learning about history .,education
they are thinking about how to shape the future. . and this focus on being .,education
we see that a lot with this generation .,education
it aligns with a lot of study that show the link between mental health and academic success .,education
of course .,education
it is all connected .,education
it is. . we have these digital native who thrive on personalized and collaborative learning .,education
and they are passionate about global issue .,education
it begs the question how do we a educator a a society create learning experience that resonate with them ?,education
yeah thats where thing get interesting .,education
let delve into some of these educational innovation that are being designed specifically for these nextgen learner .,education
we were talking earlier about nextgen learner being these digital natives. . and thats where this whole idea of technology integration come in .,education
it is key .,education
and we are not talking about swapping out chalkboard for interactive whiteboards .,education
think about learning management system. . lm .,education
lm got it .,education
which can streamline assignment feedback communication all in one digital space .,education
it is taking all the best part of the digital world and bringing them into the classroom in a way that make sense for how these student learn .,education
and it is interesting because this is not even a new concept .,education
our expert cite this two thousand and twelve study by west that emphasized the importance of integrating technology and education .,education
but whats exciting is how far weve come since then .,education
we are talking about a whole new level of sophistication personalization especially with ai .,education
which brings u back to dr. nguyens work with aipowered personalized learning path .,education
it is we are finally moving away from this onesizefitsall approach to education .,education
and personalized learning with ai allows u to tailor that educational experience .,education
to each student needs. . imagine a platform that can pinpoint when a student is struggling .,education
with a concept and automatically adjust the difficulty or provide additional support .,education
it is a personal tutor powered by ai .,education
thats wild .,education
it is cool stuff .,education
and it is not limited to individual learning ?,education
because we talked about how much nextgen learner value collaboration .,education
how doe that factor into these innovation ?,education
yeah thats a great question .,education
and it mean we need to think beyond the traditional classroom walls. . and create these opportunity for collaboration that feel natural. . engaging to this generation .,education
and thats where bringing in online community social learning platform can be effective .,education
it is interesting because these platform are already such a big part of their life .,education
it is meeting them where they are .,education
and it tap into their their desire to connect .,education
to learn from each other. . it is builtin .,education
it is .,education
and speaking of connecting it is inspiring how passionate these learner are about tackling realworld problem .,education
it is .,education
they are not learning about the issue .,education
they want to be part of the solution .,education
yeah they want to do something about it .,education
yes exactly .,education
and thats where something experiential learning come in. . we are talking handson projectbased learning that let them apply their knowledge to these real issue .,education
it is not hypothetical scenario .,education
this is digging into the real challenge .,education
think about project focused on climate change social justice even designing solution for their local community .,education
and the research back this up . . i studied by baron and darling hammond. . they found that projectbased learning led to greater engagement from student and better learning outcome .,education
yeah because it is learning by doing .,education
and it clearly works. . but it is not all about academic skill ?,education
these nextgen learner are going to need a very particular set of skill to navigate the future .,education
you are hitting on a important point because in a world thats changing rapidly we need to equip them with more than fact and figure .,education
of course .,education
they need resilience adaptability a growth mindset. . all of that to thrive in the face of uncertainty .,education
that make a lot of sense .,education
how can education help them develop those essential skill ?,education
i think it start with shifting our focus. . from rewarding the answer .,education
to encouraging experimentation embracing failure a a learning opportunity and fostering their emotional intelligence .,education
it is about giving them the tool to navigate not the academic world but the real world too .,education
it personalizes the pace the content keep them engaged and it go beyond that individual level ?,education
we are seeing amazing thing with projectbased learning where these student tackle realworld problem .,education
yeah we touched on that .,education
i think it deserves a closer look .,education
what make those project effective for these nextgen learner ?,education
it tap into their drive to make a difference ?,education
let them apply what they are learning to actual challenge .,education
even a group of student they are designing a community garden to address food insecurity or developing an app to promote sustainable living .,education
it is not theory it is real impact .,education
it is a realworld application .,education
yeah thats .,education
what other innovation are out there ?,education
get this gamification and virtual reality in education .,education
learning through vr that sound engaging .,education
it is .,education
stepping into a vr simulation of ancient rome or exploring the human body from the inside out it is immersive it is exciting .,education
it is turning education into a video game but with real learning goal .,education
and study show that gamification even in simpler form can boost engagement and motivation .,education
but it is not all hightech .,education
our expert also highlight soft skill emotional intelligence all that .,education
that make sense especially in a techdriven world you need those human skill .,education
communication collaboration empathy problemsolving these are essential ?,education
whats that ?,education
thats a term thats not at least competencybased education or cbe .,education
ive heard that term but to be honest i am not entirely sure what it mean .,education
break it down for me .,education
instead of moving through the material based on seat time or a set curriculum cbe let student progress by demonstrating what they know their mastery of specific skill .,education
it is le about grade more about actual understanding .,education
i can see how that would be motivating .,education
but with all these amazing innovation there must be challenge too ?,education
it can not all be easy .,education
whats the best way to do this ?,education
there a lot of great thing in cbe the tech the highspeed internet and the digital divide .,education
and thats what we do ?,education
we do the same thing with all these hurdle especially with something this big .,education
a major one is equity of access .,education
not every student ha the same access to tech highspeed internet which creates a digital divide .,education
thats a important point .,education
we can have the best intention amazing innovation but it ha to be accessible to everyone .,education
and we have to have the best potential development the resource to implement these innovation effectively .,education
and we can not forget about the potential downside of technology screen time the ethic of ai all of that .,education
finding that balance encouraging offline activity a healthy relationship with technology and with ai teaching these student to use these tool responsibly critically .,education
where do we go from here ?,education
whats the takeaway for our listener who are thinking how doe this apply to me to my kid ?,education
the future of learning it is full of possibility .,education
we have the tool the knowledge to create these amazing learning experience for nextgen learner but it take commitment adaptation a focus on equity and ethic .,education
it is not about the tech .,education
it is how we use it .,education
and speaking of using thing our expert left u with a great question .,education
they talked about teaching nextgen learner to think critically about ai .,education
but how do we do that ?,education
how do we make sure we are consuming information especially online with that critical eye ?,education
it is a question we should all be asking ourselves a technology becomes more and more intertwined with our life .,education
it is a journey of learning questioning adapting ?,education
it is .,education
and on that note a challenge to keep learning keep questioning keep exploring this everevolving world of education .,education
thanks for joining u on this deep dive into nextgen learner everyone .,education
until next time keep those mind open and those learning journey exciting .,education

try harder lesson to challenge yourself and improve faster .,education
and way to stop translating in your head .,education
identify object around you in english .,education
the first way to stop translating in your head is to identify the object around you in your target language .,education
if you are studying english that mean you look at the object around the room .,education
look at the thing in your life .,education
do not think of them in your native language first .,education
think of them in your target language first .,education
if i look around the room i see a computer .,education
i shouldnt think my native language word .,education
i should think my target language word .,education
start with the item and the situation in your everyday life .,education
if i say computer in english maybe i should say computer in japanese .,education
i should say not i do not know water in english .,education
start associating the word in your target language with your everyday life now .,education
if you are studying english that mean start getting familiar with the thing in your everyday life in english .,education
repeat phrase you hear native speaker use .,education
tip number two is to repeat the phrase that you hear native speaker use .,education
if you are watching this channel for example or you are watching a tv show or a movie listen for the way that native speaker make those phrase .,education
if you hear a phrase you have never heard before or you hear an interesting combination of word try to repeat them yourself .,education
do not listen try to save them yourself .,education
if you are in a public space and it is difficult for you to do that find practice in a place where you feel more comfortable .,education
maybe if you have some private space to practice repeat them .,education
get your mouth used to saying the word the way that the speaker the native speaker do .,education
if you never say word if you are only taking in if you are only listening and you are not producing the language it is hard to to practice and to hone your pronunciation to improve your pronunciation .,education
when you listen to native speaker try to repeat after them .,education
for example if you are studying english you can try to repeat after this video .,education
try to repeat after native speaker especially when you are looking at medium and you can do this when you are reading book too .,education
you can try to read out loud interesting line of book that you find or something that maybe is difficult for you .,education
very nice practice tip .,education
make a situation where you can not escape into your native language .,education
make a situation where you can not escape into your native language essentially mean immerse yourself .,education
of course going to that country or going to a place where you can speak only that language is very difficult for some of you .,education
you can not use the native language at all .,education
it force you to use the language that you are studying .,education
of course if you are lucky enough to live in the country or to live in a place where people speak the language you are studying great but you have to go out and interact with people .,education
you have to put yourself in a place where you have no choice but to speak .,education
it is very hard and it is very scary and it is very embarrassing at first .,education
but if you take time to find place and to make environment that are comfortable for you where you feel comfortable making mistake and asking question it is very valuable for your learning process .,education
this is something that i did .,education
my japanese wasnt very good for a long time but then i started making friend who could not speak english .,education
i did this through finding hobby .,education
there wa a hobby that i had .,education
i joined a group .,education
i joined a school to where i could learn how to do that hobby .,education
and everything wa taught only in japanese and the people in my class only spoke japanese mostly .,education
and then maybe we would go off for drink and food .,education
late at night or on the weekend and everybody spoke only japanese .,education
and if i couldnt communicate even simply in japanese i had no hope of keeping that friendship together .,education
it forced me to study .,education
it forced me to think about the word they were using and to try to learn those word those pattern a a how to produce them naturally myself .,education
i wa learning the vocabulary word .,education
the people around me were using and learning how to apply them on my own .,education
that wa only possible because i had no escape in those situation .,education
try to do that even if you can do it yourself in your house .,education
it is super helpful .,education
i think watch tv and movie in your target language without subtitle .,education
tip number four is to watch tv and movie in your target language without subtitle .,education
without subtitle .,education
i think that watching with subtitle can be very beneficial .,education
if i am watching something or if you want to watch something with subtitle on great .,education
but i sometimes find that i can in my case i think too much about reading the subtitle and i forget to listen .,education
maybe if youve seen a movie in your target language a few time with the subtitle on try turning the subtitle off .,education
play around with it a little bit .,education
if there a word thats difficult for you to hear you can turn on the subtitle in the native language of the movie a . thats something that ive done .,education
if i wanted to study japanese it is very useful when the actual word spoken in japanese appear on the screen .,education
sometimes it is easier for me to catch a word if i see it visually and i hear it at the same time .,education
another way to explore how you can use tv and movie is to turn on the closed caption the the the word on the screen in the native language of the movie .,education
this is two point in one .,education
one watch movie without subtitle meaning subtitle in your native language .,education
and hint two is to watch movie with closed captioning on but the closed captioning is in your target language not in your native language .,education
you can try those two thing with tv and with movie .,education
do not bring a dictionary to your lesson .,education
tip number five is do not bring a dictionary to your lesson .,education
give me a second here .,education
i understand the dictionary .,education
it wa especially electronic dictionary .,education
we have them on our phone now are very very convenient .,education
of course it is important to use them and it is a great resource to have .,education
however one thing that bother me and that i think is detrimental .,education
it is not helpful for student is when student are in a lesson and they are practicing conversation and they reach a point in the conversation where they do not know the word they want to use .,education
they know it in their native language and they do not know how to say it in their target language .,education
they pull out their dictionary .,education
they say to the person listening to them their practice partner in their lesson where they have a limited period of time a moment .,education
and then they look it up on their phone .,education
it take a few second the flow of the conversation stop and then they say a word .,education
it is whoa no thats not you do not have that ability .,education
you do not have the ability to do that in a conversation with a native speaker .,education
most people if you go to a bank and try to open a bank account are you going to pull out your dictionary and sit there and try to communicate a moment a moment .,education
a you look up each word you do not know .,education
no or if you do thats not a real conversation .,education
instead try using a different strategy .,education
by that if you find a word you do not know in conversation explain the word to your conversation partner .,education
maybe they know the word .,education
if you are speaking with a native speaker this is a chance for them to teach you a word .,education
i find that when people take the time to teach me a word i remember the word much better than looking it up on my dictionary .,education
try to resist .,education
maybe you can bring a dictionary to your lesson but do not use it or try not to use it in your conversation practice .,education
it is it destroys the flow of a conversation .,education
instead practice the skill of describing the vocabulary word you want to use and learn how to ask the meaning of a word or learn how to ask for a vocabulary word from your partner .,education
you can use an expression whats the word that mean ?,education
puppabla or it is this thing that doe this and this and this .,education
this is an opportunity for you to describe characteristic of something or find a different way .,education
you can use whatever you have a lot of tool but try not to use a dictionary in a conversation because it is not realistic .,education
number six is a quick one .,education
i think number six hint number six i have is to train response to common question .,education
for example a very common question in english is hey how are you ?,education
you should know how to answer this question .,education
hey how are you ?,education
if it take you a long time to answer the question hey how are you ?,education
you need to practice .,education
i think thats a pretty good a pretty good indicator .,education
for example sometimes i ask student a question that they havent quite gotten the idea of how to respond yet .,education
they they they are not quick at responding .,education
and they say yes .,education
and then they think and they go i am i am a good .,education
thats a very common question .,education
think about a default response that you can spit out that you can quickly say .,education
if it is how is your weekend or hey whats up ?,education
or what do you want to do for dinner tonight ?,education
think about a handful meaning a few response to those question and train them quickly .,education
how are you ?,education
there three .,education
it is training response to those question .,education
there no reason to be surprised by a question how are you ?,education
for those common question train response .,education
that weve got a bunch of video especially beginner level video for some example response you can do .,education
do not get stuck with these little question .,education
train a few response .,education
practice a few response till they feel natural to you .,education
itll save you time and itll help the person asking the question to move forward in the conversation .,education
hey study with material that do not provide a translation .,education
the next tip is to study with material that do not provide a translation .,education
by this if you are using worksheet or some textbook or whatever and it ha your target language the language you are studying and it ha your native language next to it .,education
while this can be useful i feel that if you can studying your material only in your target language and then simplify explanation for more detailed point .,education
also in your target language can be a little bit better .,education
i do not want to say you should only study thing in your target language and nothing from your native language because of course it can be helpful sometimes to look up a word or to understand a grammar point in your native language .,education
but where possible if you can find something that provides simplified explanation in your target language it can be helpful .,education
because again you are thinking you are learning to think on a simpler and a more basic level about the language you are studying in the language that you are studying .,education
this can be good .,education
finding some material to use where there no translation .,education
maybe you can practice of course with with book and with written material but also with video material a . there are a variety of different way that you can find material in your target language in video and tv .,education
some thing to think about there are the level of vocabulary word people are using in the medium content you are watching .,education
who the medium content is intended for ?,education

the first word is say say a a verb .,education
say is a very neutral word .,education
you can use to report someone speech to explain something someone said in the past .,education
for example he said the barbecue wa canceled which is a simple neutral report .,education
the next verb is tell .,education
tell is used when one person is giving information to another to tell someone something they did not know before .,education
do not say tell me your phone number .,education
thats weird .,education
but can you tell me where the station is ?,education
can you tell me where to buy a hamburger ?,education
can you tell me where to pick up my new car ?,education
giving someone information they do not know or on the other hand explaining something one way to another person .,education
do not tell me what i can not do is a very good lost reference if youve ever watched lost .,education
tell another example sentence my bos told me i wa doing a good job .,education
the next one is speak .,education
when we are talking about language ability i speak english i speak japanese .,education
we can use speak in the past tense to report something .,education
but it usually sound a little more formal .,education
i spoke to my bos about or i spoke to my parent about or i spoke to my boyfriend or girlfriend about blah blah blah .,education
that using speak instead of talked make it sound a little bit more formal .,education
you can use speak but it is going to sound polite .,education
in his sentence my colleague spoke with me about an upcoming project .,education
wa the next one the next two are very very casual expression .,education
when you are speaking with friend and you are talking about a quick maybe somewhat emotional conversation you will hear native speaker especially american perhaps this is unique somewhat to american .,education
use the phrase wa i wa he wa she wa this is a very casual way to report speech .,education
and youll hear it often very very quickly together .,education
someone will say i wa what ?,education
and then she wa no and then i wa yeah thats the pattern youll hear it in very very quick way to report speech but the subject change .,education
i wa he wa she wa we were this is a way to share what happens quickly .,education
instead of i said he said she said which might sound a little too formal we can use i wa he wa to do that instead .,education
this is a fun one .,education
and if you can use this naturally i think that itll help you sound more natural too .,education
in his sentence and then he wa i love that movie .,education
wa all the next one is also a similar to wa we have the expression wa all .,education
it wa all do not worry about all all doe not have the meaning of the whole of something or a complete something .,education
instead wa all this set phrase is used to report speech .,education
usually this one is used when there some emotional emotional aspect to your conversation .,education
or it is a little dramatic or maybe a little exciting .,education
we use it the same way a wa in that very very quick style of speaking .,education
and then he wa and i wa all and then she wa and i wa all we use those together .,education
but i wa all ha a little more emphasis .,education
i feel i tend to use it when my when i want to express a stronger emotion .,education
and i wa all no way or i wa all what ?,education
you can use it for those very surprised emotion or maybe angry emotion wa and wa all are both used in very casual situation .,education
in a sentence and i wa all my god me too .,education
the next word is talk .,education
talk similar to say is a fairly neutral verb when reporting speech .,education
youll use it in a situation where someone is giving new information to you .,education
but maybe it is a two way conversation .,education
for example we talked about blah blah blah for a topic or my bos talked to me about blah blah blah .,education
maybe new information is being exchanged but the conversation is two way .,education
there are multiple participant .,education
with tell it is the nuance is one person is reporting information giving information with talk to there an exchange happening there .,education
keep in mind when you use the word talk you will say either i talked to or i talked with someone and then youll usually have a topic .,education
i talked to my friend about my new apartment .,education
i talked to my bos about array .,education
i talked to my bos .,education
no i talked to my dog about what dog do .,education
there some there some exchange happening there .,education

let go to the next one .,education
the next one is mentioned .,education

we are based in edinburgh in the uk and also now in the netherlands .,education
and we work quite closely with the university of edinburgh and they have many project in education .,education
thats been an interesting world to get into .,education
i am the chairman of iot aplodoren .,education
that is the association that came out of the tt and aplodoren community .,education
and i am teaching still at the university of applied science where i am working with a program of embedded system engineering .,education
and ive got thirty year of experience in telecommunication .,education
sound good .,education
welcome everybody .,education
i am ben oleyenka and i do technical content for the thing industry .,education
that mean a lot of writing about how to use lorewen product and then also trying to create awareness about lorewen a a solution .,education
the first question is how do lorewen being used in education ?,education
my involvement ha been most of my customer are local government in the uk .,education
and they are keen to engage with local community particularly around thing lorewen .,education
and in the uk the teaching of technology is probably not a it should be in the school .,education
they often look for outside support .,education
in south wale i have been working with comarthenshire council doing a fun twosession runthrough of iot with nineyearolds .,education
this is originally teaching them about sensor and radio and then deploying a load of sensor in the school and then coming back six week later and doing a session all on the data that we have gathered from that and talking about thing data security and stuff that .,education
ive been doing workshop with secondary education in a technical college .,education
and i hire student a . seventeen eighteenyearold student i will hire them for project over the summer they get some real work experience .,education
and then i guess the third bit would be working with university .,education
we developed a personal safety solution for reading university developed with student at the university that ha since been taken on and it is now a safety application for the whole town of reading .,education
anyone who life there can make use of that .,education
yeah i think that should cover it .,education
ive been working with the university of edinburgh quite a lot .,education
they had some funding .,education
they have a reasonable amount of money to spend in iot device and solution .,education
and it is got to be focused in our area of the country which is the southeast of scotland .,education
this money is to be spent in benefiting the people and the environment and all these thing .,education
one of the thing they wanted to focus on is education more about data than about the technology itself .,education
they see that there a real gap in education in the uk especially when it come to data .,education
and the next generation is going to have to be able to analyze data and understand it better and more automatically .,education
and thats not being taught very .,education
their project is to put co2 sensor loroam co2 sensor and gateway into every school in the region which is five hundred and fifty school .,education
weve deployed about half now .,education
and theyve built an educational program around those that they are delivering through the teacher .,education
they are educating the educator how to teach these kid about data science .,education
and the kid in school have now got real world data to look at .,education
they move the sensor around and they see what happens .,education
they leave them in their room and they see the level go up .,education
they open the window .,education
they see them come down .,education
in this case the loroam is an interesting component of it but it is not the key thing .,education
it is more about the data and understanding what it mean and getting the reason and the understanding there .,education
thats the key thing there .,education
and our part of this project ha been helping with the delivery of it .,education
obviously there a lot of gateway to get out .,education
there a lot of sensor to get out and configuring all this stuff and getting all delivered to all these different school and dealing with all these different educational authority .,education
it is a big logistical thing .,education
but we went into one of the school and it wa fun .,education
they had some kid that were last year at primary school which i think is ten eleven that age .,education
and they had there wa these four girl that had been first to test this stuff out .,education
and they were keen and interested .,education
and they were this is cool .,education
and then we brought in some other sensor for them to look at .,education
and they are all what doe this one do ?,education
what doe this one do ?,education
what doe this one do ?,education
and they wanted to know everything .,education
they were soaking it up .,education
that wa cool .,education
they are now looking at expanding this project and seeing what else they can put out .,education
weather station .,education
and they can detect rainfall and particulate in the air and all that .,education
and they can find out more about their environment .,education
yeah i am using lora one in my program in my class .,education
and for me in the class lora one is a vehicle .,education
lora one a we all know is not fit for all purpose .,education
a for every purpose there a different protocol or whatever that you need to apply .,education
and lora one is a vehicle for me to teach my student in seven week the magic that come with designing iot device defining iot solution in there .,education
because engineering an iot solution is a fivedimensional chess play a chess that youve got .,education
on one hand youve got power low power budget from the battery low power youve got coverage youve got data rate youve got latency youve got whatever the data come through yes or no .,education
all thing that if you design an iot solution and thats what i am teaching my student lora one is capable of offering you that .,education
and the fun thing about lora one is that it is a modern standard it is a relative recent standard although two thousand and sixteen two thousand and seventeen there still a reason .,education
it is secure by design it is with low power in mind .,education
and whats very nice about lora one standard in my course is that it is a standard it is only this thick .,education
you can read it in an evening not necessarily .,education
it is not a fun evening is it ?,education
but you can read it in an evening and then you do not understand everything but you can start with it .,education
if you go for a modern standard narrowband or ltcadema or whatever i do not know whether the stack of paper fit here from the floor up to the ceiling and i can deal with that in seven week .,education
lora one is for me a vehicle that i use to have use case they come with a use case and they have to implement it .,education
and they have to think also about it whether lora one is the technology of choice .,education
and of course ive decided to use lora one you get an indoor gateway from me you get a nice device to prototype on but you may challenge me in my class and say youve chosen lora one you should have chosen narrowband .,education
and then i say good idea .,education
come up with a reasoning .,education
and there are not many strand of technology where you can understand the whole endtoend piece relatively quickly a a student it is something you can pick up and feel youve got a good grip on it .,education
every piece that is in the chain from the node from the sensor up to the presentation in there youll find it everywhere in every other technology in every use case again .,education
maybe a bit differently implemented but the foundation is the same everywhere .,education
it is a chain and thats the nice thing about lora one .,education
and you can run it all yourself you can do every part yourself you are not reliant on an operator .,education
and it is what also is very nice is and thats also very important in modern education depending on the need the interest of the student you can divert within the range of lora one he more interested in low power then you dig into low power .,education
he want to know about the back end here tt here chirpsack whats that ?,education
youve got a server implemented do it yourself and come up with the result .,education
and then all these individual initiative they are all brought together into the same project which work in the end .,education
that sound a interesting variety of example there .,education
do you get your student to read the lora one standard ?,education
and what fun is i start with a presentation on lora one and then there are a couple of video which unfortunately are v2 video then i always have to translate yeah you prefer that one but nevertheless and then after three week they all get a challenge .,education
do thing foundation training and the exam on here and seventy five of them take the exam and get the badge .,education
and thats also quite interesting because then they have also the element of competition in there .,education
yes they go in there and i have weekly i have question i challenge them and i come up with i confront them in their engineering decision with the standard say this how do you address that ?,education
and then weve got a very interesting discussion with you guy .,education
i wrote some of those question and i havent read the lora one standard in it entirety i do not think that .,education
youve got some homework now then .,education
yeah yeah thats tonight .,education
if you have trouble sleeping read the whole thing .,education
on the train maybe .,education
sure is a disadvantage about the lora one standard .,education
you can still sleep in it when you put it on your pillow and it is heavy on your head when you start sleeping .,education
i think that you guy touched on this a little bit but why do you think it is important to use lora one or maybe even other type of iot in education ?,education
one thing that you said made me immediately think about the gender gap in stem .,education
you mentioned that you have a group of girl who are excited about the census .,education
that wa a funny one .,education
this wa one of the first school that they deployed this in a a test case .,education
we went over to see them and chat about it and i did a little talk about my bit of the world and stuff .,education
but apparently they asked the class to put their hand up if they were interested in joining and doing this stuff first .,education
and it wa these four girl that went they went straight into it .,education
and they ran with it .,education
now and what wa interesting is these girl who are ten or eleven are now dragging in all of their classmate and this is cool .,education
and then everybody else is looking over their shoulder and going yeah they did not .,education
thats great thats interesting .,education
thats better than stuff on a whiteboard .,education
that work .,education
theyve added theyve become cheerleader for the whole thing and getting people involved .,education
and thats good .,education
but rolling it out across all the school obviously youve got a nominal fiftyfifty mix of gender and school .,education
youve got all those kid there youve got a captive audience to talk to .,education
every kid of that age in our region of scotland is going to be learning about this stuff .,education
it is not that it is not going to be a divided thing .,education
you are all going to get a look at it or get a chance to play with it and thats how it should be .,education
hopefully a a father of a daughter i am hoping that this gender gap will close and well see how it go .,education
but i think this is a good start .,education
i think whats very important is about loroana is that it is accessible .,education
and with that you have more youngster kid coming in being able to start with it .,education
and they have very rapidly they have the experience of success .,education
and when the experience of success is there then the fun come in and all these thing facilitate in the learning .,education
and i think loroana a a protocol if it a not a a mean but a something that you can use in what you want to obtain then that is very much supportive on that one .,education
i suppose that you are saying that obviously you can do that the whole piece .,education
you can do the whole thing from end to end .,education
but you can also quite easily skip large section of it .,education
you can hide the difficult bit and say here your sensor .,education
let not worry about the network server bit .,education
that work let say on some dashboard .,education
you can start with a nice overview and work down .,education
when i did an engineering degree my lecturer called it a process of diminishing deception .,education
then first year everythings cool everythings easy .,education
look at this shiny stuff .,education
and then in next year it is remember i said that wa easy .,education
peel back a layer .,education
and then by the end of the time you wanted to kill yourself because you are now down at the atom .,education
yeah you simply level up .,education
but it is a way you can start at the top and work your way down nicely can not you ?,education
yeah i hired tracy who had finished her alevels .,education
she hadnt done a a she wanted .,education
she wa going to resit them that she could go to university .,education
she came to work for me for a year .,education
she came up with the idea for the personal safety app .,education
and we pitched that to the council together .,education
and she got one hundredzero worth of funding which a someone who is shes nineteen at the time thats a real endorsement for your idea .,education
and thats through learning a bit about laura wan and what potential it had .,education
and then going on to deliver it wa it is been a real growth for her .,education
she went back absolutely aced the alevel .,education
shes done a degree a master shes doing a phd now still involved in technology which a you said at the beginning the gender gap is a real problem .,education
and this is one way or one example of someone who beaten that and doing in it .,education
... thats a inspiring story .,education
i think with laura wan and iot you are able to plant a seed in these youngster where they are sensible or sensitive to technology .,education
and this piece of interest is growing in there .,education
and at some moment it can take short or long time it blossom and then they are capable of doing some nice thing much nicer thing than we have done far with iot with laura wan for example .,education
what would you say is unique about using laura wan in education ?,education
the diversity .,education
i think for u it is the variety of thing you can do with it .,education
the different application different sensor .,education
many different sensor that we are not teaching the protocol but we are teaching how to use these thing .,education
and it is you can get weather station pest control you can have the environmental thing being monitored you can do soil sensor all sort of stuff .,education
and i guess we do quite a lot in higherlevel education a and research .,education
when you go up the stack youve got a lot of research going on and there people here doing all these thing research project and they want a sensor for this and a sensor for that .,education
and laura wan doe all of this stuff now you can always find the device for them .,education
and then that enables their research to happen that much more easily .,education
the variety of use case allows you to make them wonder .,education
they come up with a sensor with an ultrasound height meter and then they go what do i use this for ?,education
and then you come up within the context of global warming or for example the flood network which is in the uk .,education
and it work the other way around a where they can come to you and say we want to measure this .,education
and you go yeah i have a thing for that .,education
and not necessarily the thing you thought of but we know how to do that .,education
we can always find something .,education
we had a reverse due cash project in there where they had to do all kind of thing and there wa one guy that came up yeah i wanted to do some communication with the box. . consider laura wan .,education
and there are some limitation which you ran in rapidly into and you had to address it .,education
we have very much a learning experience on that one .,education
yeah thats all possible .,education
i think there something great if youve got laura wan in a town a because you can take the stuff outside of the school system .,education
marcos project with the junior iot challenge is absolutely fantastic .,education
and if you havent seen it it is worth going to talk to .,education
but this idea that you can start with something in school and you can think about how you might apply it to your own home or your garden or kid love the idea of being able to see where their pet cat is gone in the garden .,education
and thats something you can realize .,education
they can do that .,education
and i think that mean that they are thinking about it more than in the lesson time .,education
al you also mentioned that you can conceal complicated part of the system and then later make them simple .,education
and i think laura wan is interesting in that you can you can run a gateway and explain how to set that up and what it doe .,education
and then you can go outside and use a gateway thats managed by somebody else .,education
you have both of these aspect where you are plugging into a system that is bigger than you but then also you are able to relatively quickly set that up and understand it .,education
yeah and there many resource online a for learning .,education
kid are brilliant at finding the howto video .,education
better research is on the web than we are .,education
but we also the tti video .,education
you make some nice video that make thing easy and understandable .,education
but we johanns video which is wa it laura wan in an hour or thirty minute or something crazy ?,education
it go from end to end .,education
and whenever weve got a new person that we are saying here a video cover everything .,education
sit down have a cup of coffee .,education
and it start out easy .,education
it is youve got gateway and device .,education
and it is bang spreading factor bang adr .,education
it get all the detail .,education
but you can yeah the whole thing can be done in an hour .,education
and you sit and concentrate .,education
when we have new people starting saying we can we can onboard them quite quickly into the laura wan world with a few of these video and get them going .,education
and they understand a whole lot of it .,education
i remember watching that the first time and not understanding anything .,education
yeah you have to watch a few time .,education
you have to watch a few time and then use stuff .,education
each time yeah .,education
and it is the handson aspect that then make those thing that are already in your brain sit i think .,education
where do the future of laura wan in education or in iot in education and stem in education ?,education
i see the future in a much a birmingham city university dr. adela neba .,education
he wa here in i think two thousand and seventeen two thousand and eighteen and then started teaching laura wan in his bachelor degree with student back then .,education
i am now working with people whove been through that program now at research level still at the university putting project together that involve using laura wan to do other research .,education
and i think thats exciting .,education
and i guess at the much younger end in wale again i wa one of the school wa in a town and the kid there had done this a couple of week earlier .,education
theyd been running business virtual business at school .,education
and they were interested in how you could apply laura when wed been through the workshop i wa doing with them how you could apply that to their business and manage they were talking about football going in and out the shop could you tell this ?,education
and this is a nineyearold kid and i think thats brilliant .,education
and then i wa at another school which is much more rural .,education
all the kid come from farming background and their ability to decrypt encoded message .,education
i would write something up in encoded on the board .,education
and by the time id finished writing they would be there going i know what that is .,education
and i think it is very exciting .,education
if we can get these skill into people young enough and the interest and enthusiasm that come with it then hopefully that carry through .,education
yeah i think for me the scale now now that we are seeing much bigger rollout of stuff we are finally with the seton reunion project we are rolling out to all of the school .,education
it is taken a long time to get all the council and education authority to agree to get these device into their school which we now have much more agreement this project is going faster getting them out there .,education
well be covering thousand and thousand of kid which is great .,education
but also youve got now much bigger deployment of sensor environmental sensor which mean youve got much more data to work with .,education
now there a whole other bunch of research and another education avenue that open up based on the data thats being captured at much bigger scale .,education
and i think thats interesting from teaching kid about data and how to use that .,education
thats interesting .,education
when we deployed the sensor in the primary school i thought maybe this is an in with the facility side of thing on the school .,education
and i think thats you are absolutely .,education
these new data stream are going to provide a lot of raw material .,education
i think laura won we can all say laura won is here to stay .,education
a couple of year or we were in doubt but now we know for sure laura won is here to stay .,education
and i think with the change that we see in society and in climate and everything too and all the ability that weve got machine learning grew .,education
the vehicle the train is still there .,education
the only thing is that at some point we are going to do some thing differently .,education
before we talked about edge computing now it is called machine learning which we still move to the edge .,education
and we are going to do these thing more and more practically .,education
we are still going to work with laura won with this chain of information in there .,education
and we are going to enhance part in that and study more on that and find new opportunity on that one on this chain ai displaying addressing big issue or big challenge that weve got in these society in our society .,education
yeah i think it is only enabling u to grow further on that one .,education
thats the way i will look at it .,education
i saw a presentation from edge impulse about using ai to generate data set that you do not have to do any work to collect .,education
and i thought that wa interesting .,education
i hope we do not lose kid with clipboard .,education
they are doing little tally .,education
counting car and yeah .,education
yeah i imagine everyones done that .,education
nowadays you use sensor network .,education
you can automate that .,education
my last question is what is your most inspirational story from having used loronn in education ?,education
the fact that a student come to me sir or it wa an acn student professor i wa in your class and now i am in a project i am doing these thing on that one .,education
it is the best reward you could get .,education
they come up youve planted the seed they carry it along with them and at some moment it come out of the basket and hey i am going to use these ive got a purpose for that and then you are successful .,education
thats the feeling that i get .,education
youll be good at that .,education
yeah yeah thats fine .,education
you can give a few example .,education
you can give a few example .,education
i think i am going to be grateful for whatever she produce .,education
but there are ... ive got a guy who ... he worked with me for a few week over the summer .,education
i do not think i had very much to do with this at all .,education
he spent the whole time arguing with me about what programming language we should use and then he did a great job .,education
we were doing a digital playground for an agricultural college in northwest wale .,education
and he helped write that and he wa absolutely brilliant .,education
but he went on ... he decided not to go to university .,education
he got a job with a startup in london .,education
it is probably worth more than all of u now .,education
and then there are others who went from me to cisco and have been getting promoted through there .,education
another guy who become a real data whiz .,education
most of them go to university and then into technology .,education
it sound special .,education
what programming language wa he ... what wa the answer ?,education
i wa ... let see at the time ... on that project it wa node.js and javascript .,education
and he wa strongly advocating rust .,education
he wa way ahead of his time .,education
and interfunctional programming .,education
and that wa the ... he went to work for a company that wa using rust .,education
and yeah i do not think he ever looked back .,education
any other closing word ?,education
thank you for having u . thanks much .,education
thank you remco .,education
thank you al .,education
thank you for sharing the passion that you have in education .,education
it wa fun to be here .,education
good to have soulmates here on this day .,education
on this day on this discussion .,education
this is also the last session on this stage .,education
we can say goodbye to everybody .,education
thank you .,education
why would they do that ?,science
we are closing the omega portal and until next time keep it absolutely weird weird science is the revolution,science
hello and welcome to crowdscience from the bbc world service .,science
i am anand jagatia and a you can hear we are currently surrounded by livestock .,science
i want to see if you can work out how many of each animal there are .,science
to give you some help here the farmer .,science
i only keep sheep goat and horse .,science
in fact at the moment they are all sheep bar three all goat bar four and all horse bar five .,science
i have to admit thats a tricky one .,science
and i also have to admit that this is not a show about farming it is a show about math and number .,science
now i did spring that on you in case you missed it here the farmer question one more time .,science
fine ill repeat it then .,science
get a pencil to write it down if it help .,science
at the moment my animal are all sheep except three all goat except four and all horse except five .,science
how many of each do i have ?,science
ill reveal the solution at the end of the show .,science
but how did you find that ?,science
did you manage to get to the answer already ?,science
doe working with number fill you with dread ?,science
or doe it come easily to you ?,science
it definitely doesnt come easily to our listener israel from papua new guinea who got in touch with this week question .,science
my question to crowd science is why am i bad in math and why are others better than me in math ?,science
ive been bad in math since the third grade or something .,science
do you have a memory of a time maybe when you were in third grade of how you found math hard or in what way you struggled with math ?,science
yeah i can remember this one time .,science
the teacher taught u long division throughout the week and at the end of the week she gave a test .,science
most people did better in the test .,science
i asked my friend how come you got better at math in long division and i did not .,science
and he said you are naturally slow in math .,science
yeah it is interesting is not it because for some people even if they study hard and they work hard there something about math that they find difficult .,science
wa that your experience ?,science
i tried studying hard memorizing the multiplication time table and doing more activity doing the same activity that the other people who were good in math did but still i did not get a good a they were .,science
yeah i hated that subject towards the end .,science
thanks israel for getting in touch .,science
why are some people better with number than others ?,science
math is one of those subject that tends to divide the crowd and also it turn out crowd science listener .,science
we reached out and asked you to tell u about your relationship with mathematics .,science
some of you felt that you were bad at math .,science
everything looked complicated and even question i wa able to solve before now looked some of you excelled .,science
some of you noticed clear difference between your classmate .,science
while some of you loved it at school .,science
i think this mysterious puzzle that i can help everyone to solve .,science
mathematics ha always evolved mixed emotion within me .,science
i see mathematics a a language .,science
i think we are traumatizing our child for no good reason .,science
until i had a new teacher .,science
i do not know how to calculate them .,science
and i am now a math teacher .,science
always hated math .,science
pleased to see you for you .,science
thanks to everyone who got in touch with u . clearly listener israel is not alone in thinking about this stuff .,science
and one thing he mentioned wa that his classmate told him he wa naturally slow at math .,science
but what doe that mean ?,science
and is it true that some people can be naturally good or bad at math ?,science
it is a very good question .,science
and often when people talk about naturally being good or bad naturally at something they also refer to some concept of being born with something .,science
this is professor yulia kovas from goldsmith university of london .,science
shes a geneticist and a psychologist who study why people have different mathematical ability .,science
i often hear very deterministic view about genetics that say i am bad at math because everyone in my family is bad at math it is genetics and nothing can be done about it .,science
similarly there are example of for example mathematical talent running in family .,science
people often think that that mean it is not malleable in any way .,science
but all of these assumption are wrong because mathematical talent or disability may run in family for both genetic and environmental reason .,science
sure. . i guess your job a someone who researching this is to try and untangle these factor .,science
how would you go about studying that and what some of the work that youve done in that space ?,science
ive worked for many year on a very large scale twin study in the uk which ha about tenzero pair of twin consistently followed from birth .,science
and in this study we compare identical and nonidentical twin .,science
and one more thing is that all twin live in the same family .,science
here you have a perfect control for environmental factor .,science
they all live together .,science
they have the same family the same parent same socioeconomic status .,science
a lot of factor equalized .,science
but identical twin they are more similar than nonidentical twin on every psychological characteristic we studied .,science
they are more similar in mathematical ability .,science
and that suggests that home environment do not explain all the variability .,science
it seems that gene do contribute .,science
. . because the identical twin and the nonidentical twin have both pretty much had a similar a life a it is possible to live .,science
but the identical twin who are exactly the same genetically are more similar .,science
you can say there got to be something going on here with the gene .,science
this is a usual conclusion from twin study .,science
and the evidence is quite solid. . i guess we can say that there good evidence that there is some genetic or inherited component to whether you are good or bad at math .,science
but how much of a big deal is that ?,science
if we look at the estimate it seems that in secondary school and in adulthood the heritability genetic component of mathematical learning and ability is about fifty to sixty .,science
it is an interesting number .,science
it reinforces this idea that gene and environment are both important and to a similar extent in a way .,science
we know now that gene and environment always coact .,science
they interactively affect our characteristic .,science
but i think what is very important to mention that when we talk about environment we do not mean something very specific teacher or parent or school or something that there are thousand of factor that can be in play .,science
and of particular importance are environment that are not systematic that are individual specific maybe random .,science
maybe something you heard on the radio may change the whole path of your interest or motivation .,science
it is unpredictable and random .,science
the word environment we are using it in quite a scientific sense there but maybe it would be more accurate to describe it a everything your body ha ever experienced .,science
and then that would give people a sense of how broad it can be .,science
and you say something can send you on a path that you would never be able to trace and never be able to know .,science
but thats what life is i guess .,science
and there is a concept for this recently discussed in the literature .,science
it is called exposome .,science
thing you are exposed to throughout your life. . you have your genome and your expo zone a . yeah .,science
and your collection of everything .,science
but even these genome and exposome are not unrelated because in many way your genetic propensity may lead you towards particular exposure .,science
and even if both of u hear the same radio program we can extract completely different thing from it .,science
i find ulis research surprising .,science
our gene do seem to play a significant role in how good we are at math .,science
but thats not to say that there a single math gene .,science
and it is also not the whole picture .,science
perhaps this episode of crowd science will have a bearing on your future mathematical ability although a ever more research is needed .,science
but if listener israel you think that you are bad at math perhaps you are studying it currently at school this doesnt help you very much .,science
you can not control your gene and it is not always easy to change your environment .,science
do we a individual have any control over how good we are with number ?,science
is it possible to change your mathematical fate ?,science
thank you much for asking that question because we need to set the record straight here .,science
eero xenodudervu is a researcher at loughborough university in the uk in the department of mathematics education .,science
everybody i feel need to know that we can all improve in mathematics .,science
we might not all become expert mathematician but we can all develop the numeracy in mathematical skill that can help u thrive and improve our quality of life .,science
we mustnt forget that there also a lot of evidence both from u but from many other colleague around the world showing how our thought our belief our attitude our emotion around mathematics includes mathematics anxiety influence our math learning journey and our performance .,science
it is important for people who want to improve their math skill to also believe that they can .,science
it need time and effort anything in life ?,science
i wanted to pick up on something you mentioned there around emotion and how you feel about math and belief .,science
this is something that our listener israel mentioned .,science
when he wa doing math at school he struggled with it initially and he did badly on a test and then he started to hate the subject .,science
what do we know about the thing that can affect them or make their journey even more difficult or worse ?,science
yeah feeling and emotion and belief and attitude play a very important role .,science
if at any point for example you fall behind for a bit or you are exposed to also gender stereotype or you have negative experience your listener regarding math it can be at home or at school you might start developing anxious thought and feeling around math .,science
thats started vicious circle .,science
anxiety in math lead to avoidance of math which also then lead to poor performance which then increase math anxiety even further .,science
what math anxiety doe is that it overload our working memory .,science
working memory is the mental space where our thinking take place .,science
it is where information is stored and processed for a very brief amount of time and it is very very limited .,science
what happens with anxiety is that these negative anxious thought take up a lot of this precious space in our working memory and there very little left for you to use to solve the problem at hand .,science
weve recently conducted a study at loughborough with my team where we looked at this link between working memory and math anxiety in childrens mental arithmetic .,science
these were child nine to ten year of age and they did a two digit mental arithmetic task on it own but also in a condition where we interfered with their working memory .,science
that is they heard word before the arithmetic problem and then they had to recall these word verbally they had to retain them while doing the arithmetic task .,science
and what we found is that of course the working memory load impaired impacted childrens performance but we found that this wa particularly crucial for highly math anxious child .,science
for them they were not doing two task they were doing three task .,science
it amplified the effect for high math anxious child .,science
what i am curious about is what is it about math thats different from history that it mean because people do not talk about having history anxiety .,science
what is it about math that it mean it ha this power over people ?,science
probably it is the fact that it entail many skill that are intertwined ?,science
it is math is complex .,science
i also view math learning a building a mental brick wall .,science
you need to set all these brick and set those solid foundation .,science
you can not skip brick in the mathematics domain .,science
for example in history perhaps you do not know very one particular era and thats fine but in mathematics you can not do that .,science
you need to build those solid foundation to later on be able to advance to more higher order mathematics .,science
is there practical advice that you can offer to people who might struggle with math or feel badly about it and want to change their relationship with it ?,science
i want your listener to know it is never too late to learn math and improve your numeracy skill .,science
you have to believe that you can do it .,science
it take time and effort but there are many resource online that can help you achieve that goal .,science
be kind to yourself .,science
you want to try to change your mindset .,science
you have to believe that you can do this and slowly start strengthening your numerical and mathematical skill .,science
you are listening to crowdscience from the bbc world service where we are answering a question from listener israel who want to know why he bad at math .,science
far weve heard that part of the answer is in our gene but that doesnt mean your success in math is set from birth .,science
a important are all the thing out there in the world that shape u over the course of our life .,science
and no matter how much you might struggle all of u can improve our skill with number .,science
while it is helpful to know that we can get better at math if we believe that we can the attitude can only take you far .,science
a child the way that we are taught math in school is surely an important part of the puzzle and that depends on where you are in the world .,science
i went back to professor yulia kovas to ask if there are any country where math education is particularly strong .,science
and she told me about some interesting finding from the early 2000s .,science
the top of the international ranking were chinese student some other country east asian country and finland .,science
and finland ha been branded a a european paradox because it is there amongst these other east asian country .,science
yulia is talking about something called the pisa survey which among other thing test basic math skill in fifteen year old from various country .,science
ranking this are not perfect and there are limit to what they can tell u . because you do on a standardized test doesnt necessarily mean that your education system is better .,science
but in two thousand and three finland surprised a lot of people by getting remarkably good result .,science
is there anything we can learn from country that tend to perform ?,science
i called up two education expert to find out .,science
i am currently a assistant professor at jiangxi naman university in china .,science
i work a a professor of practice at the university of turku in finland .,science
one thing that both of these country have in common is that they focus on the basic when it come to math .,science
the main philosophy in the finnish education system used to be to guarantee the basic skill for all .,science
four basic which is about the basic knowledge basic skill basic math experience and basic mathematical thinking .,science
and another is that teacher are supported and respected .,science
all the teacher in finland get five year academic training .,science
and because of the respect what the teacher have it is a profession what the youngster want to have .,science
we have ten time more applicant than we have study position .,science
yeah teacher are usually respected regarded .,science
and education is also regarded .,science
we have very highly qualified teacher who also at the work have a lot of freedom to do their work the way they want to do .,science
they will only need to teach one to two lesson a day .,science
and the rest of the time they will be able to talk to their peer to discus and plan lesson together and give each other advice on how to improve that specific lesson .,science
but there are also difference including how the best and the worst student do in each country .,science
if you look at the variability within country let say in china doe everybody do ?,science
no there is a huge variability in every other country .,science
and the difference between worst performing and best performing child translates into ten year of schooling .,science
it is a if one never went to school and one ha already completed ten year of education which demonstrates the complexity .,science
and if you look at the finnish distribution what they are showing is that at the top finnish child perform very similarly to top performer in other country .,science
but at the bottom there are fewer child who are doing badly .,science
and in that sense on average they are doing better .,science
if they are putting effort into helping struggling child not to do badly then thats already a huge thing .,science
whether top performer are now more brilliant at math time will show probably not .,science
you could say that finland ha some of the best worst math student .,science
how do they do it ?,science
i asked finnish education expert pekka .,science
the high level of investment to special support for learning .,science
every school ha special teacher who do not have their own classroom but they are teaching those kid who are falling behind in education .,science
and they are trying to guarantee that everyone would learn the basic in mathematics .,science
i should point out that in recent year finland ha dropped down the ranking to be more in line with other european nation although it is still number thirteen out of eighty one country tested .,science
it is unlikely that there a secret formula for brilliant math education .,science
instead it is more about thing persevering with the foundation and making sure that teacher can do their job properly .,science
no surprise there .,science
it is also hard to compare different teaching system given cultural and societal difference between country .,science
there this nice saying about when you are trying to explain a very complex systemic phenomenon .,science
there an answer which is simple need and wrong .,science
yeah exactly .,science
we human tend to answer that are simple and neat are not they ?,science
there never an answer which is one factor affecting thing .,science
far weve looked at gene emotion education and environment but there one last thing we have to explore in some people that struggle with math .,science
to understand what that is we have to look at how we sense quantity and we might get some clue from culture that do not have word for number .,science
culture which are nonnumerate where the language contain no counting word .,science
brian butterworth is a professor at university college london who studied counting in indigenous community in australia .,science
they have marker on some of their noun and verb about whether it is all or some or few .,science
they do not have word or marker for specific number one two three or four .,science
and i guess they do not need them ?,science
they get on fine without them ?,science
they get on fine without them .,science
they get on fine without them .,science
for example when they are trading which they do often across long distance it is facetoface trading .,science
ill give you this if you give me that .,science
they are on the whole huntergatherers they do not have flock to tend .,science
and when they gather they gather whats there and take it back to their camp .,science
you looked at a specific community who have one of these language .,science
whereabouts in australia do they live ?,science
we looked at two different community .,science
one in the central desert a few hundred kilometre from alice spring and another on an island off the north coast of australia .,science
we could test two separate community to see what monolingual child in those community could do with number .,science
now it is quite difficult because you can not ask them how many nut are there on a tray .,science
you can not ask them because they are not the worst to ask them that question .,science
you can not ask them but you can do this test which is you put out a number of nut on your tray and you say make your tray the same a my tray .,science
we can also test thing addition .,science
i can put let say four nut on my tray cover them up and then in full view of the child put let say another three nut under the cover and say now make your tray my tray .,science
and if theyve done the addition in their head theyll put out seven nut on their tray and they can do this .,science
with these kid is it a visual thing ?,science
or doe it only work if they can see you putting the nut out or can it go to more abstract level than that ?,science
number are abstract .,science
in order for them to have number you have to test whether they have an abstract sense of number .,science
they clearly have the concept they could do it .,science
brians work show that human have a builtin sense for number .,science
even child that have never been taught to count because they do not have the language for it have this sense .,science
but the important thing for israel question is that in some people this sense doesnt seem to work very .,science
yes some people have very bad numerical sense and it is very easy to test because the innate mechanism is designed to extract numerical information from the environment .,science
you can test individual number sense by asking them to do a task say how many dot there are on the screen and you can look at how accurate they are at that and how quick they are at that .,science
you could create a measure of their efficiency in extracting numerical information from the environment .,science
and individual who are not very good at this tend to have a great deal of trouble learning ordinary arithmetic thing that you and i can do rather easily .,science
they find extremely difficult .,science
and we call these people discalculics and we explain to them and they find helpful that the reason they can not learn basic arithmetic is not because they are stupid and not because their teacher are very bad .,science
it is because their innate mechanism doesnt work very .,science
these are all reason why you are bad at arithmetic .,science
and how common is it ?,science
i am sure most people have heard of dyslexia but maybe dyscalculia is le known about .,science
yeah how prevalent is this condition ?,science
we think it is about a prevalent a dyslexia properly diagnosed .,science
it is about five .,science
people with dyscalculia tend to struggle even with simple arithmetic task 5x8 or 6x16 .,science
but brian and his team have developed something that might help .,science
and weve run test on this game .,science
can we have a look at this game ?,science
go to the first level breaking and breaking one .,science
there a little introduction .,science
on the screen there are line of bead in group of up to ten .,science
each amount ha a different colour and set can be combined .,science
or you can split them .,science
i cut this four into two set of two .,science
the idea is to build or break these set of bead to produce a target amount .,science
and this help child understand that five bead for example contains a set of two and a three .,science
and to get them to represent numerical information in term of set .,science
you get on to the next level .,science
where you are learning to associate these bead with the digit .,science
yes you are getting the hang of it now .,science
and at the end this level now there are no bead .,science
there are no bead at all .,science
they are the digit .,science
brian ha run test using this game in london italy and singapore and found that it help child with basic arithmetic .,science
in particular those with dyscalculia .,science
but it is still unclear what intervention this could do in the long term .,science
we can help kid and adult have a better understanding of how number work .,science
whether theyll ever be fluent calculator you are an and or i am .,science
it is not clear because what you would need to do is intervene early and then track the development of these kid over the next few year .,science
start in year one and end up in say year five or year six and see if it doe cure them .,science
or whether it help them be a little bit more competent .,science
listener israel you asked u why am i bad at math ?,science
weve heard that there are many factor at play here including your gene and environmental factor .,science
the place you learned mathematics .,science
i remember going to school in china .,science
a a your motivation and emotion when it come to number .,science
the anxiety i have about math .,science
but there is hope .,science
if math is important to you and you want to improve you can get better .,science
i shut myself in my room with that book .,science
although it might be hard work which is anything .,science
and then i aced that final test too .,science
there are some people however likely around five that have a learning disorder which affect their number sense .,science
and this make it a lot harder to do arithmetic .,science
thing five plus eight or ten time fifteen .,science
but there is much more to math than sum .,science
to end the show let me introduce you to emma .,science
she doesnt have an official dyscalculia diagnosis but shes always struggled with number and ha gone on to do great thing .,science
i studied astrophysics at university and i did a phd in cosmology which are both very mathematical subject .,science
i am also bad at mental arithmetic .,science
at school i never managed to learn my time table .,science
and i still can not work out the offer in the supermarket without a calculator .,science
despite this i wa always quite good at what people tend to consider to be more advanced type of mathematics .,science
thing algebra or calculus .,science
but of course that doesnt mean that you can not get good at thing that you find difficult .,science
i did learn my time table a an adult because i needed them to pas a test and i wa very very motivated to pas that test .,science
of course ive forgotten them again now but at least i know it is not impossible that for me thats a lot of hard work .,science
thanks emma .,science
and before i go a promised the answer to the problem at the start of the show .,science
all my animal are sheep except three all goat except four and all horse except five .,science
how many of each animal do i have ?,science
the answer is one horse two goat and three sheep .,science
thats correct .,science
this is a bit of a tricky one if you did not get the answer here is one way of working it out .,science
all of my animal are sheep except three mean that horse and goat must equal three .,science
there could be one horse and two goat or two goat and one horse .,science
but we know that they are all goat except four and that they are all horse except five which mean that there must be more goat than horse .,science
that mean that there is one horse and two goat .,science
but we also know that all of them are horse except five five animal minus two goat equal three sheep .,science
and thats it .,science
done if you got the answer you clever thing .,science
now back to listen to israel for the credit .,science
thats it for this episode of crowdscience from the bbc world service .,science
it wa presented by anand jakatia and produced by florian bo .,science
today question came from me israel in port moseby papua new guinea .,science
you have a science question youd the crowdscience team to look into .,science
you can do what i did and email crowdscience at bbc.co.uk .,science
thank you very much for listening .,science
tomorrow is halloween which mean lot of sweet and chocolate if you are lucky .,science
but with all those treat come even more wrapper and therefore even more waste .,science
i am sure weve all noticed in recent year that an increasing amount of packaging is now advertised a sustainable in some way .,science
but is it ?,science
a couple of week ago polymer scientist and sustainability expert mike shaver joined u at the ri to give a talk about his work in sustainable material development .,science
i managed to nab him for a chat a couple of hour before his talk to find out how to make my halloween a sustainable a possible .,science
mike thank you much for joining me today .,science
your team up in manchester look at sustainable material design particularly concerning plastic .,science
obviously plastic pollution is a mammoth problem to tackle but in order to create a better alternative we need to fully understand their role in our society .,science
in place supermarket and shop on the high street why were plastic introduced in the first place ?,science
i think thats a important question .,science
i think the first thing to think about is what the alternative were ?,science
and you used to go to a shop and you used to buy something which might not have any packaging at all .,science
we think about some of the item we would have bought from a grocery shop .,science
but the real benefit of introducing plastic and packaging were twofold .,science
the first is that they could increase the shelf life of material and that would prevent food from spoiling .,science
and the carbon footprint of food is higher than the package itself in many instance in most instance .,science
and we were able to both prevent food from spoiling and get a secure and more efficient supply chain for that food while keeping our carbon footprint low .,science
and the second thing is spoilage .,science
the consequence of that food going off is that food is a lot safer than it used to be .,science
we have fewer people who are going to get sick from food .,science
we now see that food recall are very rare .,science
and thats because the plastic can offer a lot of protection for those material .,science
and because that offer protection while being a efficient material to make and a very lightweight material an efficient material to transport make it very sustainable .,science
and when you then look at the difference between purpose and what some of the marketing is on new packaging it becomes a real challenge to unpick a a consumer .,science
yeah i think plastic is often painted a all these question are often preaching stop using single use plastic but a thats impossible .,science
but b that might not necessarily be a good idea because they are there for a reason and they do help a lot of thing .,science
and i think that thats especially true when we look past the bit of our world which we demonize the most in term of plastic the grocery store .,science
we think about hospital and why they have plastic .,science
they have plastic for important reason .,science
and they again keep u from getting sick keep disease from propagating and making sure that we can deliver health care in an efficient way .,science
the same is in the built environment .,science
and weve looked at the construction industry .,science
we used to be using lead pipe and now we are not using lead pipe anymore .,science
we are predominately using robust plastic type .,science
and the plastic universe is very intertwined .,science
and that doesnt mean that we are not supposed to be thinking about how to make it more sustainable .,science
but we depend on these material and these material are often the lowest footprint option to deliver whatever function we need them to deliver .,science
in the hunt to find a sustainable alternative what doe that sustainable plastic landscape look currently ?,science
whats the current trajectory of what we think could come in to replace it ?,science
yeah i think the first thing we have to address is that there are no panacea .,science
there no silver bullet that we can go let do this ?,science
because of the diversity of plastic function and the role that they play we need to be able to have lot of different solution that are going to work .,science
and ill give you an example back to the grocery store .,science
if i look at plastic wrap that might be over different food product .,science
that plastic wrap again is there for a reason .,science
but if i look at the plastic wrap that is around meat for instance it is important that that plastic wrap is impervious to oxygen because if oxygen get into the package then the meat will spoil .,science
but equally if i were to take a courgette that courgette if thats packaged up it ha to be able to release moisture .,science
it ha to be able to be permeable that same plastic wrap .,science
and the public might go and look at that and say we have two wrap that look the same .,science
but they are very complex material that have unique function and we have to make sure that they are fit for purpose .,science
the first thing for any alternative is we have to make sure that it delivers the same function ?,science
and that it can still perform what we needed to perform .,science
the second thing we need to do is to make sure that the that this is not a solution that exacerbates another problem ?,science
the law of unintended consequence to make sure that those material are produced themselves in an efficient way and that they themselves are sustainable .,science
and then the third thing is to consider and this is where a lot of our work sits to consider a multitude of different fate .,science
and how do we have a system in which we can incorporate lot of different thing ?,science
and some of those plastic item should be reused ?,science
some of those plastic item should be recycled .,science
some of those plastic item maybe would be degraded or perhaps deconstructed in some way .,science
but it is about getting a system in place where all of those different potential fate can work in concert with each other to get a sustainable outcome .,science
rather than one sustainable plastic it is more of a new sustainable system .,science
in all these case where there a sustainability branding what doe that process look ?,science
and is it accurate that that is whats happening to the material ?,science
i think that there is a lot of good work being done in the uk to provide a bit more authenticity around what those word mean .,science
but the challenge is that it take time to embed those process .,science
we have a number of legislative measure in the uk stuff the plastic packaging tax which is mandating thirty recycled content in our package to the upcoming extended producer responsibility legislation .,science
and the challenge with legislation however is that it lack the nuance to address those difference and integrate into a system .,science
and that lead to a little bit of a wild west approach where something can make a claim and it is not clear how thats realized .,science
and a good example of that is recyclable .,science
recyclable doesnt necessarily mean that that is recycled .,science
and for some i guess actor in this space those actor might be making a claim that something which is incinerated or incinerated for energy perhaps that that should be considered recyclable .,science
and when you have a lot of vested interest it lead to public perception of what those word mean not matching the reality .,science
and the same thing is true with recycled content .,science
and from our work we can show that by far the best sustainable outcome .,science
if you have a product the best thing for you to do is to increase the recycled content in that package .,science
but that is technically very difficult to do because of the same variability that we talked about .,science
you had mentioned the halloween candy ?,science
and when you have halloween candy or when you have christmas quality street tin suddenly have a change in the composition of the waste .,science
and if thats going to the recycling industry then suddenly the composition of their recyclet which is what weve called the material thats coming out that we want to include back into the packaging ecosystem also change .,science
we have seasonal change .,science
we have change based on geography .,science
we have change based on medium story which perhaps are giving the wrong messaging .,science
and that creates this complicated ecosystem because the company that are trying to include recycled content they might have a variable quality ?,science
and then they do not know that they can include this material with confidence .,science
that lead to a lowering of trust both with the public because they do not believe the word that are said on the package and a lowering of trust in the industry people the brand owner who are trying to incorporate that .,science
and that then come back to some fundamental science .,science
how do we go and develop the quality control tool that we need to be able to provide that authenticity both to industry that want to do the thing and public that want to do the thing .,science
and public that want to do the thing in term of purchasing .,science
and they want to know that the decision that they are making are the most sustainable one they can .,science
i think it is common that these issue come up and people in the general public do not have time to go and research .,science
what process wa behind the quality street wrapping changing from the foil to the papery packaging which i think wa in the last couple of year .,science
i wouldnt have time to go and for myself make the decision of whether or not that wa an accurate sustainable change .,science
i think that trust in the organisation that are doing it is crucial because people rely on it from a time constraint .,science
and i think that that that the uk ha been progressive in pushing for that .,science
the challenge is that it take time .,science
we have thousand and thousand if not hundred of thousand of product within the uk that even if we consider the packaging industry thats a lot of change .,science
and that change ha to exist in an international ecosystem not with the eu in a legislative sense but also also with the fact that we import and export many different thing from many different country .,science
talking about this trust in organisation labelling thing a sustainable that all fall under a broad title of greenwashing .,science
and on the topic of greenwashing there wa an example you used in a previous talk which i wanted to ask you about .,science
and that wa the mastercard story .,science
could you tell u about what happened there ?,science
that mastercard doesnt get me in trouble i think it is important to highlight that there are two kind of greenwashing. ?,science
there greenwashing which is purposeful .,science
and when an organisation know that what they are saying doesnt match the reality i think that thats a real problem .,science
and that requires an intervention .,science
but oftentimes organisation that we work with they do not know what the most sustainable option is .,science
and they are trying hard .,science
but if they do not have the information that they need then they could go and say something which then afterwards they are going to get accused of greenwashing .,science
and i think this is the case with the mastercard example where one of their leader got up and said this is the world first biodegradable credit card .,science
we all have them in our pocket .,science
and when that degraded in the environment what would it do ?,science
it would release the barium from the magnetic strip it would release the eighteen metal that are in the chipset all into the environment .,science
it is an ecological disaster waiting to happen .,science
it is not ideal .,science
but what do they do about it ? ?,science
they made an error in term of not understanding the unintended consequence .,science
and they then came to u and asked u what would a sustainable card look ?,science
and the reality is is those same metal those same element that are in that credit card are valuable .,science
and you can go and redesign your card and say we are going to build that around deconstruction .,science
we wouldnt be able to recycle that in the same sense because again all of those different material would get mixed into the recycling and lead to an exceptionally bad product .,science
and we did try that once or twice for fun .,science
but what that allows you to do is to then do what we call a deplimerization but a deconstruction of that card back down to the original chemical unit .,science
and we extract that chemical value from the system .,science
but when we strip that away what that offer is you can isolate the different metal that are in the chipset .,science
we even did it once or twice where we recovered the chip .,science
i can say with assurance that no nobody can get your data from those chip .,science
no one bank account wa hacked .,science
and i think that that show that you can go and create economic value by thinking about something a simple a a card .,science
now what wa interesting if i go into this a little bit further is when you then think about the social context of that .,science
what am i talking about ?,science
i am talking about going and getting someone credit card and then deplimerizing that back .,science
but everybody and i am sure you do it a not only do when you are done with a credit card do you cut it up probably into six piece .,science
you then take three of those piece and put them into one bin in your house .,science
and three of those piece somewhere else because somehow that is going to foil the economic mastermind who are going to go and steal your data .,science
and i think thats the challenge is if we can not recover that material then we have to be conscious ?,science
that we are not greenwashing ourselves in the sustainable solution that we devise .,science
if we can not get that security of material supply then we are never going to be able to deplimerize those card .,science
and where we are looking at that now is a very different space of the master card .,science
and thats in hotel .,science
because of what you do is you check into a hotel youve got your card you beep it into your room and then what do you do afterwards ?,science
and now you have an ability to go and have a secure supply of those card and people do not care because there is no information on it .,science
but they still have the same element that are on the inside which can be valuable to those system .,science
and thats very much about showing that technology ha to be developed for the reason ha to be developed with purpose and then developed in concert with stakeholder from across the value chain to get something off the ground .,science
i guess some of it also particularly in the credit card example rather than the hotel card is ease of consumer ?,science
is that a factor that also come in when you are devising these thing ?,science
and i think that this is especially true when you look at waste management system a they exist when you are outside the home ?,science
and a soon a you are on the high street do you want to go and take all of your packaging and then bring it back home and then separate it into the different component ?,science
it creates a real logistical challenge .,science
and a lot of the work we do is trying to make sure that the system is adaptable to the most common social practice rather than expecting behavior change .,science
because i think the valueless nature plastic are very much invisible to u . and that invisibility mean that we are not thinking about them .,science
and then to expect u to think about them and to change behavior is challenging .,science
it mean that the behavior change will not stick .,science
and building the system to adapt to behavior .,science
using behavioral understanding rather than expecting behavior change .,science
talking about how people recycle your research project focusing on this is called one bin to rule them all .,science
what is this project looking at specifically ?,science
yeah one bin to rule them all started a a joke with some of our industry partner and now is probably going to end up on my gravestone .,science
but the reality is that it is saying if the challenge is to secure supply what will people do if you give them a bin and say put everything that you think in plastic that is plastic into that bin ?,science
and then layered over that are three framing or three way to look at the plastic that might come through those bin .,science
thats a social science aspect .,science
qualitative social science interviewing the household who participated in our trial .,science
thats a material understanding .,science
understanding not only the nature of the material which could get put in there but importantly the contamination and then the economic opportunity which might be created from those material flow .,science
and i think that this is probably the first time that those three thing were looked at together in concert with each other .,science
and lot of time people look at these challenge from a disciplinary bias but to do something from a genuinely interdisciplinary space lead to very different decision .,science
and ill give you one example of that .,science
if we were to think about flexibles recycling ?,science
and this ha been a very hot topic .,science
you probably will have gone to a uk grocery store and seen the bin that you can shove your growth flexibles inside .,science
and when we looked at social practice on this what wa clear is that everybody took a flexible shoved all of their other flexibles inside that flexible and then tied a knot in that flexible .,science
but what everybody did from social practice is to transform their 2d material into a 3d material. . and now we have a consequence on our imagined sorting system .,science
and we have to think critically about making those sorting decision .,science
and the reality is is thats very much how our project work .,science
what are the sorting decision that we could make ?,science
what are the sorting decision that we should make ?,science
how should we make those ?,science
and where is the economic value hidden in those stream ?,science
that need to be informed by social practice .,science
we can not go and say everybody else do something .,science
do what we tell you to do ?,science
because we know i am originally from canada .,science
but in the uk man consumer are willful ?,science
everybody want to do their own thing .,science
and the system ha to adopt to that diversity of practice .,science
and that system then ha to make decision based on that diversity of practice .,science
you can define different technology or different solution that work in concert with each other to create that sustainable system if you understand the behavior that are going into that one bin to rule them all .,science
one of the behavior that you looked at in this research wa looking through people rubbish .,science
and i know there at least every other day in my kitchen there a debate about is this recyclable ?,science
can i put that in the recycling or can i not ?,science
maybe we shouldnt because we do not want to risk it .,science
what did you learn about how people recycle ?,science
we had different household study which were based across what are called the index of deprivation .,science
and that sound very grand and also mean .,science
but it mean across different socioeconomic demographic .,science
i think what wa firstly interesting is that there wa a great appetite to do the thing a long a that thing wa simple .,science
and a soon a that became more complicated then people would get confused .,science
and the type of contamination would change but the appetite to do the thing did not change .,science
and there is a huge amount of potential material that could be available .,science
but what we need is consistency ?,science
and that consistency come from legislation .,science
and a lot of our recommendation i guess from a policy standpoint were fed into what became the simpler recycling policy .,science
and that policy is not perfect .,science
and thats the economic tipping point that go and ensures that this happens on a much grander scale .,science
and the opportunity is there .,science
it is with u taking it .,science
what would your forward look goal be for this almighty singular bin scenario ?,science
what would you say five ten year down the line ?,science
what would be your ideal outcome ?,science
not to put you on the spot .,science
what i would say what we call rigids ?,science
and you can think of that your milk jug or your plastic tray .,science
rigids if they are clean and if they are segregated they offer good value .,science
you can mechanically recycle them .,science
in our lab weve done this hundred of time .,science
in the real world you can not do that hundred of time because there the law of physic you are competing against .,science
but in that scenario ridge are recyclable .,science
and focusing mechanical recycling capacity and that is very much what the norm is now i think can take the bulk of those rigids and make them into valuable product .,science
those valuable product do not necessarily need to be in the same sector ?,science
and it is a bit naive to say that the circular economy if youve heard that phrase is we should take a yogurt pot and turn it into a yogurt pot .,science
why do we not see value in taking a yogurt pot and turning it into a car ?,science
if you wanted if i could give you one of two thing a yogurt pot or a car you probably would take the car ?,science
the car hold a lot of value .,science
yeah i lean towards it .,science
and i think that thats the key is opening up what we consider to be valuable and keeping those material in it highest value condition .,science
reusing the thing that we can reuse transitioning those into recycling potentially putting those in different sector and then ensuring that we are underpinning that with good quality data that allow u to make those sustainable decision .,science
and a lot more openness and transparency in term of everything from the composition of material to how they flow through our life is key to allow u to make better decision and a system in which no plastic is released into the environment .,science
what we have to do is to move away from an extraction focused economy but we know that we have to keep using plastic .,science
and keeping them in the system for a long a possible is key .,science
for those listening who would to get a car are there any other obviously a lot of the change that need to happen is at a much higher level and a government need to implement certain thing .,science
i think that underneath all of this is if we are going to move away from an extractive world we have to buy thing that are valuable .,science
and buying thing which you want and which you need which you can keep in your life for a long period of time is key .,science
and what we want to avoid is the reactive i am going to buy a soft drink in a bottle because i feel thirsty now and ive forgotten my refillable water bottle at home .,science
i am going to hope for the best maybe check my recycled my recyclable bottle into the bin .,science
ive not looked at the package to see whether it ha recycled content but in the uk we do that very .,science
and then somehow that get turned into a sweater that i buy off of some lowquality website and i wear it twice and then it fall apart .,science
and i think that we have to buy smarter .,science
and that mean that we are looking for the thing that are sustainable now are item which have more recycled content in term of packaging item which you are going to keep and use for a long time .,science
something which is repairable or you are going to be able to reuse numerous time and avoiding those buy and throw away reactive purchase because they provide you with a little bit of dopamine .,science
short answer impulse control will help .,science
i know we keep linking back to halloween but i think weve spoken a lot about halloween candy .,science
and another thing that people might differently associate with halloween is drinking .,science
i am going somewhere with this i promise .,science
i know your team have looked specifically at sustainability in the beer industry .,science
what doe that entail ?,science
essentially one of the in manchester we run whats called the sustainable material innovation hub .,science
and one of the first project we did wa to unpick what is the most sustainable way to package up your beer .,science
and manchester is home to a plethora of absolutely fantastic brewer .,science
and we host the ditsbury beer festival where you can go and try all kind of different one .,science
but i think within that framing it is you have all of these different option for how to transport that beer .,science
you could have it in keg .,science
and that keg could be made out of metal or made out of plastic .,science
you could have it in cask .,science
and most of those cask are metal now although there some movement in the industry .,science
or you could then package it up in individual thing .,science
you could have it in a bottle a glass bottle or a aluminium can .,science
and each one of those ha a different sustainability footprint .,science
and we were surprised because if you think about it youve got to go and transport that beer from the brewery to wherever .,science
and the idea of putting that in something metal and heavy that ha a huge influence on the carbon footprint of those process .,science
and keeping that low the most sustainable option which we looked at wa using a plastic keg .,science
and there different brand for those and i am not going to market those brand .,science
but that is a decision that the brewing industry moved towards .,science
not because they had a sustainability setup but because it wa le expensive .,science
they were using le petrol to move everything around .,science
and because they were paying for weight in term of transportation they switched away from glass to aluminium can .,science
and they switched away from big metal keg for the most part to the plastic keg .,science
and that made their industry more sustainable .,science
but they did it for an economic reason .,science
and i think the interesting space we are in now is when we can tether an environmental outcome to an economic outcome then everybody win .,science
and it is getting industry to realise that that opportunity is present now and that they should take advantage of it .,science
there a misconception that the more ecofriendly way of doing something is more expensive .,science
but that certainly doesnt seem the case in that example .,science
and there are many option where it is still challenging to be ecofriendly .,science
but that doesnt mean that there are not opportunity .,science
and often getting a business to reframe their thinking identifying quick win for them which have that economic and environmental tether thats the beginning of a journey for them .,science
because sustainability is never absolute .,science
it is always a journey .,science
it is always relative .,science
and it is about moving along that space and each year being a little bit more sustainable than the year before .,science
there wa a popup by uber a couple of week ago in london and they put up their first carbon negative pub .,science
and i did not go because i only found out about it after it happened .,science
but from what i can understand they got people to pedal on bike whilst drinking which then powered the electricity of the pub .,science
and they had other thing going on that i think became a carbon deficit .,science
it wa overall carbon negative .,science
is that something you see being more common going forward ?,science
or do you think it is a case of the change that youve mentioned with transportation and thing that need to be implemented at first rather than making a cycling pub ?,science
yeah first thing first i think we should make it very clear that these were stationary bike and we are not at all recommending that people should cycle around london .,science
and cycle .,science
yeah do not drink and drive even under your own power .,science
but i think whats interesting there is it is a little bit of a gimmick ?,science
because that might be true that the operational cost .,science
we call those the emission that are associated with operating .,science
but of course what you have then is the embodied carbon and whatever those cycle were .,science
and it is a huge footprint .,science
how long would they have to have driven those cycle around to recover the carbon thats associated with the production of those bicycle in the first place ?,science
yeah i think it wa a two day pop up .,science
yeah a lot longer than two day .,science
there probably need to be the uber ceo need to still be down there cycling away .,science
but i think what those event do do is to bring a community together to start talking about sustainability .,science
and even if that is a little bit gimmicky if it brings sustainability up in discourse up in the narrative around which we how we purchase what we decide to do that i think is important .,science
and even with a little bit of greenwashing of that it still is a good event because it is framed around sustainability and it get people to think .,science
i think it is also a case of instead of the narrative of making your lifestyle more sustainable mean it need to be worse instead of being you can still do this thing that you normally do .,science
and it is a little bit weird and quirky and fun .,science
instead of losing something in your life in order to be more sustainable you are gaining a bit of a different experience and not having to not go to the pub anymore .,science
and i think you are also choosing your you choose you choose your vice a . . and the going out to the pub having a pint without purpose i think is when you have the option to go out and do something with purpose .,science
and that could be a simple a i am connecting with people and i am building up a social currency that is important and considering that we are all in this ecosystem together .,science
i think all of those thing are key but we should be thoughtful about our consumption and we should consider sustainability economic environmental and social sustainability and how we live our life .,science
i have a final halloween link back and a final question for you .,science
and this can be with a sustainability viewpoint or not .,science
in preparation for tomorrow do you have a halloween costume planned or do you have one on the back burner thats a good safe bet ?,science
what i would say is that the most important decision that you have to make in the halloween costume space is the same a weve been talking about with the rest of this in that you want something which is going to last .,science
something which is meaningful to you but that you can reuse .,science
and i find the best thing to do is to go to a thrift shop figure out something that somebody ha already loved and build the costume from there but build it in such a way that you can reuse it again and again and again .,science
and if anybody asks you why you are wearing the same costume a last year you can say you are trying to save the world .,science
also it is a good costume why not ?,science
and it is a good costume ?,science
i think thats the key reuse and buy something which ha been discarded by someone else .,science
on that note thanks much mike and good luck in your talk .,science
yeah thank you very much .,science
thanks for having me .,science
thats all for this month .,science
thanks for listening .,science
make sure to keep an eye on our youtube channel for mike full public program talk .,science
but in the meantime head to rigb.org to check out all our upcoming event from more amazing speaker .,science
welcome. . hello hello everybody and welcome to the citizen science podcast and we are live if we are having technical issue but i am happy you all are here and let go ahead and get the show started .,science
anyway we have the one and only samuel hoffman of course here with u . let go ahead and add him on we can talk about this twin solar system .,science
there other planet that are passing close by earth ?,science
a we speak now we are going to be seeing lot and lot of picture of them a we go through the show today .,science
i do not know why the music stop .,science
thats the second week thats happened and it throw me off .,science
and taylor get it off and go welcome instead of welcome to the show .,science
it is normal .,science
anyway we have to we have to .,science

it is been very cold at night lately .,science
we have been below freezing .,science
it wa twenty seven degree and twenty nine degree last couple of night .,science
frost on all the ground snow in the mountain .,science
thats chilly .,science
the leaf are all pretty much falling off the tree and yeah .,science
yeah it is fall and the kid will have a bunch of leaf to walk through on halloween night which is only five day away .,science
it is supposed to be seventy degree halloween night in oklahoma .,science
seventy five .,science
a big rewarmup hot pressure system went through this week .,science
i know you have to bring the other guy out but do you remember last week show we were talking at the beginning of where i wa doing the weather and we were talking to the people that were in new mexico .,science
and i hope those folk were that may have been listening because they immediately got bombarded with a very very serious blood scenario a we were on the show last week .,science
i knew it wa coming but i did not know it wa immediately while we were doing the show .,science
somewhere in canada got bombarded with a flood at the same time frame also .,science
that stood out .,science
i got in trouble again for our flood video .,science
i did not tell you about that .,science
i do not want to if you are going to play those video do not run the sound .,science
talk over it yourself from the information that you gathered from the video .,science
yeah do not play the sound .,science
i think thats where you are getting it .,science
. . ill try that .,science
try that .,science
thats why i stopped .,science
flood video and stuff that because i wa getting in trouble for them and never give out death count or say a couple of key word these day .,science
we are having to change our key word .,science
we have it .,science
we never used to have to worry about what you are saying now but now we have to be very careful .,science
and i have speaking of strange i am not even there nobody even on my personal page anymore commenting or liking .,science
it is i do not get out to anyone anymore .,science
and i post a bunch of stuff on my personal page and granted only my friend can see it but i have over fivezero plus friend and nobody commenting .,science
we should definitely have more people popping in and popping out .,science
i did see yesterday one of your short came across the youtube short playlist on smart tv .,science
that wa a good thing. ?,science
we were . . you got promoted .,science
honestly i got some views. . speaking of which i did in christopher video around a whole bunch of site today because he had such a short view count .,science
and i sent it to about twenty different site today we can up his view count .,science
but anyway i am sure you have to bring your guy in and here we are gossiping and they are in the green room .,science
hey are you guy eating the doritos and all the green mm and all the green room ?,science
speaking which one would go get a couple ?,science
i see julian and she look shes ready .,science
she look shes ready .,science
she ha a big smile on her face .,science
let go ahead and get julian in here and we can see how thing are going in scotland .,science
hey there she is .,science
julian watson everybody .,science
i am trying to keep puppy dog off my lap because i brought my halloween tub in with me because it is got my sweetie in .,science
my show sweetie .,science
the baby .,science
for all of u theyve eaten all their sweetie already .,science
the only thing theyve got left is their doggy chop .,science
a couple of piglet .,science
thats how it is in scotland .,science
it is been raining raining raining .,science
it wa seven degree celsius and it wa raining .,science
in the morning it wa entirely different .,science
but by the time i got out of work a i opened the door to go out thats when i know whats happening .,science
my weather app wa .,science
it say rain by three oclock .,science
and what do ?,science
there it is .,science
and what did i forget at home today ?,science
my waterproof trouser .,science
what a genius. . . . i do not know what to think .,science
you had to be out riding your bike in the rain .,science
that would be not fun. . no .,science
i hope it stay clear for you on your journey to and from work .,science
thank you .,science
i am not working for the next two day .,science
we can talk about that too .,science
let go ahead and get christopher in here .,science
i see he sitting there all by himself in the green room and it look sad .,science
let go ahead and get christopher in here with this guy .,science
he quite lonely .,science
he ha eaten .,science
hell be eating all these chocolate and these scissors and stuff .,science
save u some munchies. . hey there he is christopher .,science
hey everybody .,science
how are you guy doing ?,science
it is still warm .,science
it is i think it is set at eighty five degree but it feel a lot hotter than that. ?,science
i walked across the street before the show and i am all hot and sweat .,science
my forehead sweating .,science
it is still hot here .,science
. . i have to go and let these two dog out or else ill get moky .,science
yeah i wa going to say yesterday it is nice .,science
it is in the 70 here and i stepped out back to take picture and the sun wa hot .,science
it start stinging and i am this is not comfortable .,science
i stood there and i wa thinking i had a feeling of dread .,science
if it get unbearably hot i am going to be miserable .,science
i wa thats what i thought to myself because it is already seventy degree and my skin is burning. . it is weird .,science
it is not .,science
it is not .,science
that would be that extra star that is not being seen by most of the population here .,science
and if we are feeling it .,science
the animal know it is there .,science
the plant snow it is there .,science
those winter overplants that weve never seen before here in montana where you can have a garden that turn to seed and is still living sticking out of the snow .,science
ive never seen that in montana before but we have seen it up here for quite a few year now .,science
it used to be that .,science
that took a half hour when i wa a kid. . that took a half hour before you even got warm from the sun .,science
and people do not realize that we have a big huge red mall .,science
god ive watched a bunch of climate climatological video this last week .,science
it and they are talking about co2 sequestration and then what we have to do and how we have to adjust our living and all this blah blah blah .,science
and i am going to meanwhile i am standing there shaking my head going yep you are not taking into a big as thing that came up .,science
from below .,science
thats why we are hot .,science
thats why it burn .,science
thats why we get instant suntan now and all of that. . anyway and it is it is not the size of your sun .,science
it is way bigger way bigger star than weve ever had throughout my lifetime .,science
that that should maybe account for something .,science
i took a video the other day either evening a sunset and the sun wa big .,science
ill show you all the clip in a minute but yeah it wa noticeably huge and flaring a i moved the camera around the sun would bulge out and do crazy stuff .,science
it wa very noticeable .,science
and one other thing i do not know the last couple of show youve heard me complain about not having any good picture day no cloud though that ha still remained the same .,science
we are going on about a month sam .,science
i check i check all the time .,science
i keep looking at because a soon a it is great i am going to go live .,science
i want to go live and i want to have something to talk about .,science
but whats going on ?,science
everybodys getting picture of cloud but nothing here .,science
we are very white out going on again .,science
i had blank out. . yeah nothing .,science
yeah i i i drove yesterday and i hardly saw anything in the sky either .,science
i saw the asteroid .,science
i saw a couple of tiny little star destroyer up there but for the most part i did not see a lot of planet .,science
i saw a little bit of saturn yellow moon ion tail going from the hand side of the sun to and it wa in the south at the time because it wa the sun wa in the southeastern slash south sky and which it shouldnt be .,science
it is supposed to be overhead at noonish and one oclock and two oclock but no it is in the south sky .,science
do not worry about that .,science
thats normal .,science
not and it it blow me way of all the thing that are happening now and nobody notice or put these together .,science
and they are antinormal in everything that i ever grew up with .,science
and ill tell everybody again go watch an old western that wa filmed in the 70 . look at the size of the sun .,science
look at the cloud in the sky .,science
you it is nothing in comparison to how what we have going on above our head now .,science
i am realizing i am going and then it moved and then it moved and then it moved and i am wow he doing it .,science
and when you give me goosebump you are doing good. ?,science
thats awesome .,science
i thought that wa important to show how how quickly after you make a drawing these photo start coming in that match .,science
it is incredible .,science
is it that ?,science
let look at that .,science
this is incredible .,science
you got to you take a first glance and you are yeah but then you got to stop and look back and forth make the comparison and even look at the shape of all the streak about the tree there and look at sam drawing .,science
and it is the drawing wa released a few hour before this photo wa submitted and it wa taken yesterday in idaho .,science
and also i want to point out immediately when i saw this drawing i thought to myself about how orange i sat him wa .,science
and i am i saw in the drawing he had put yellow and whatnot into i sat him .,science
that stood out because i said i am red .,science
and anyway within a few hour this picture i wa scrolling and i am my god it is orange the drawing .,science
anyway i had that one of those moment but it is perfect .,science
and then here another example .,science
and it not orange but still you can perfectly see the lead asteroid .,science
you can see that darker blue rounded shape .,science
yeah it lined up perfect to .,science
and you get line up perfectly .,science
you do not have to make any adjustment .,science
all you have to do is overlay sam picture and it fit exactly .,science
you do not have to resize it or crop it down to make it fit .,science
it fit perfect .,science
it is incredible .,science
and i will point out again that i do not copy this off the computer and i sit down in the living room at the living room table and next to my window which ha a north facing view .,science
and i do not copy out of the sky either .,science
i sit down and with my dinner plate and my ive got this plastic peanut butter top and a bowl .,science
and thats what i draw the round shape with and i move them around in front of me on the paper until it fit what my brain is telling .,science
this is where it is .,science
this is what i see .,science
and this is what i think .,science
and then i draw it in and it is completely prehand .,science
it is out of my head .,science
and thats where it give me goosebump because it is unbelievably accurate .,science
and and it is amazing because this is what i see in my head .,science
and i draw it is perfect again .,science
again it is and weve been watching it at least ive been watching it now for it is been a year but i think ive been able to visually see it for myself for eight month now .,science
and we are watching it month after month .,science
we can tell exactly what is in the sky .,science
and then sam draw these drawing and they fit perfectly .,science
i thank you main .,science
i took now because i did not think i wa going to see anything .,science
it is been gray the whole day .,science
and when i looked at it because i wa waiting for the amazon man the i looked at it and i seen it .,science
it looked on the horizon but over to i am not even sure what that is anymore because i am sure we tipped again .,science
we are twisted round the sun coming out even further behind the tree now .,science
but i do not know how rapidly this thing happens because we are moving into our one orbit .,science
yeah this is my first time watching it because last year i wasnt when i came here .,science
but this year i can look at everything and it is amazing .,science
and i thank you the picture rebecca .,science
i do not know if you found them .,science
they are glorious purple and purple and pink streak and them .,science
but they had orange .,science
i heard you guy talking about orange now .,science
the base of saru ha moved far closer within the last couple of week too .,science
i am sorry to cut in but apology .,science
one of the dog hurt himself and if we were out now took me a wee bit .,science
but i did hear you say something to do with me but yeah .,science
saru is moving in more quickly on the horizon to the midleft of left of the sun .,science
and it got bigger even in the last week .,science
and i saw a couple of shot earlier for the last couple of day where we are going wow thats big wow thats big wow thats big .,science
yeah they are going over the top of u and the opacity is getting smaller .,science
and attu and attus mood are getting smaller .,science
and we are starting to see actual spatials of attu .,science
now generically and we were talking about this prior to the show generically we are seeing attus mood is in front of attu predominantly .,science
but we are now starting to see the underneath and the bottom of attu a which is also in your video christopher. . yeah because i am sure ive seen ridge of something .,science
it wa incredible .,science
and nicole got a couple of good capture today a showing the same thing .,science
and of course this is people around the world capturing the same thing because thats whats above u and thats whats real .,science
and these are not cloud .,science
these are planetary object with cloud their own atmosphere around them .,science
and they continue you will leave continuously but then you will leave .,science
i always hate that they appear the same .,science
now here another example of a saturn shellamoon in front of a saturn .,science
although yeah and lead object which is darker dead center .,science
on the top .,science
yeah you can see it .,science
flame base cloud and the flame micro clouding and the orange .,science
i wa going to say mainly i pulled this up because you were talking about saru .,science
and i the light blue at the very bottom you said with saru .,science
on the left hand side on the left hand side behind that track that circular rounded cloud that is light baby blue above the horizon on the left .,science
thats the open core bottom of saru .,science
and that thicker one line of cloud above the light blue is the base ring of saru .,science
and it is very thick and there one of them .,science
where nepecity ha three ring .,science
saru ha one very thick lower base ring .,science
the blue immediately above that base ring is the green blue of planet saru .,science
which is on the left hand side of the sun .,science
with an axis tip hattus axis tip is getting greater now .,science
and then yuri is getting pushed out of the way and up and big .,science
and there at dawn and then doe the big final reveal at the end of the day at sunset you can finally see yuri better .,science
and it is weird how all of that rotates around u along with our sun .,science
and strange .,science
hey i see hector lopez is here .,science
hector i got your letter .,science
thank you .,science
it only took two and a half almost three month .,science
thank you very much .,science
what a relief .,science
yeah i wa concerned .,science
i wa concerned for him too .,science
and it is it is important to me .,science
thank you .,science
it wa perfect timing a always is .,science
of course everybody know out there we are all broke now me included especially .,science
and they they i am going to say they raised my damn internet bill nine.forty last month .,science
and then next month and then the next month and then it keep going up and up .,science
and i am paying one hundred and seventy five a month for internet now .,science
thats a lot .,science
thats a lot .,science
it barely work .,science
if higher speed wireless download yeah but upload speed absolutely suck .,science
and the only thing worse than that unfortunately is that i find out that starlink is even worse on upload speed .,science
yeah ive been hearing a lot of people talk about that how it is it shuts off at random time and they got to deal with it i guess .,science
there a lot of political going on around the uplink to starlink now .,science
we mean we might see a very serious argument over said service because some people who are involved in that are getting themselves into trouble on the political and economic commonplace of the market .,science
and anyway ill leave it at that .,science
i do not want to go into too much detail but elon musk is making some mistake .,science
but anyway yeah i know that ive mentioned it probably through my as over it and it is merely my opinion .,science
and i am entitled to my free speech opinion of what i see happening on the public news service .,science
thank you .,science
talk place or anything because i am not a stock broker and i can not give up on that advice .,science
cover that one .,science
and no hamster were injured in the making of this video .,science
let see who all is here .,science
let see who here because i see several .,science
i do not want to get back to the top here and boy look who here .,science
it is nicole first in line .,science
thats pretty since shes been first in line .,science
i think nicole hello from shes in colorado .,science
this is your friendly reminder that et never left always been here .,science
she know .,science
she know .,science
good to see you nicole .,science
and by the way i that you did it too .,science
yeah yeah yeah well play that too here in a short minute .,science
thats fun wasnt it ?,science

but good to see you hector .,science
and he wa apologizing for being twenty four minutes. . ill let you slide .,science
and josies here. . wait not that .,science
did not click .,science
hey there she is .,science
and we are all caught up .,science
and robert giving u high five time three .,science
but hello everybody .,science
let me ill show you all real quick what i am talking about a far a a sky .,science
here my little tiktok from a couple of day ago .,science
this is about six.thirty in the evening .,science
and this is what the sky ha been looking .,science
i am not kidding but i take morning picture and evening picture and it is there nothing to see. . wait let me try to play it again .,science
but i still know they are there .,science
i it doesnt matter whether the sky is blank or clear .,science
it is not letting me play it .,science
ill get to that .,science
ill play it in a second .,science
it keep i probably am going to have to back out and come back in .,science
that happens regularly .,science
yeah you get to fall once when you are talking a moment ago .,science
this is after every show i send stream yard a message with my list of issue .,science
i had no i had no notice this morning when i woke up at all. . ill be .,science
that make you wonder if the whole world ha gone down and or or is it you .,science
i know a few week ago verizon had a total shutdown of their service for several hour and i am did i pay the phone bill ?,science
but yeah we had no internet no electrical and we and that wa one of the night .,science
and you are sitting there i got five handle burning in the living room i can stay warm .,science
standing with your hand out going electricity you can turn back on anytime now .,science
and we had a pretty heavy windstorm the other night and that wa that brief thing that went through montana and then up into canada .,science
but then that wa part of the warmup and that cutoff low that went through and over the top of colorado the other day and then over the top of you guy rebecca and then since left the country and is headed toward the uk .,science
and four day later nobody even remembers them .,science
it is why these guy are going to be repairing this damage for the next ten year and society ha already forgotten four day later .,science
let not forget what you stopped in florida and north carolina in asheville .,science
and now because they are in the valley and that side of north carolina never get hit with tropical storm or hurricane and they got they got the straight line flooding in there and that went all in those little tight little valley and asheville is gone .,science
and i am sure there a whole bunch of them gone .,science
yeah there and there still another body count and i hope i do not get blank for this but it is over two hundred and forty people and still ninety people missing .,science
and that wa the last i heard .,science
that could be inaccurate by today count .,science
but they are over two hundred and forty people .,science
it is not important anymore of that stuff .,science
we do not know whats going on .,science
yeah it is amazing how past it is .,science
yeah the people that live there have a different story than what the people .,science
yeah ive heard a lot from people on tiktok and these video and they are given to you on your feed and these people are all there .,science
they are there .,science
they know whats going on .,science
thats sad. . i am annoyed because the medium is ... it is not even coming yet .,science
it is not even coming .,science
northern africa they flooded last week the week before france flooded a couple of day before that because it wa the same storm .,science
look whats going on in africa northern africa which is hilarious .,science
they are getting rain and the desert is turning green and it is happening quickly .,science
i think you can see that from up high can not you ?,science
you are getting satellite footage of the the sahara desert is now turning green .,science
and it is not small area .,science
theyve seen on satellite that ha to be a biggest area thats no green .,science
all of northern africa is changing and it is getting greener .,science
and now remember all the flooding in the desert in saudi arabia and yemen and all of those guy are all soaked and theyve got twenty year worth of rain this year and last year .,science
and all of thats going to change .,science
ive seen video from greece on the fourth of october .,science
these mad purple storm with lightning and that wa when bonkers and pouring. . and it wa sideways storm .,science
and weve already forgotten about the typhoon that went through taiwan and north korea and vietnam .,science
and that wa a week ago .,science
no there something else coming is not there ?,science
two hundred and forty kilometer per hour wind sideways .,science
you couldnt even see across the street .,science
now we had that here in montana a a couple of year ago .,science
we had seventy and eighty mile an hour wind that went through and you couldnt see across the street .,science
and it tore all the tree down everywhere .,science
and then we had that storm here a couple of month ago through lolo and that hit missoula and missoula county .,science
and those were the top peak gust .,science
i think it wa ninety five mile an hour up on one of the mountain .,science
and local mountain not a big mountain a local smaller mountain .,science
and the outside the valley of missoula or one of the mountain at the edge valley of missoula at ninety five mile an hour gust .,science
and of course the downtown area the university district got wiped out from all the older tree that have been in the city for forty fifty year .,science
and those thing got trashed .,science
this is happening all over the world .,science
and i do not think people are sharing that .,science
off the road .,science
and i think they are calling it an isolated isolated incident .,science
and it is not we are watching drastic dire extreme climate change go off before our very eye .,science
and how we were supposed to have storm ashley during the week ? .,science
here the thing about three day before the storm .,science
they kept sending me cipa alert .,science
now thats the scottish environmental protection agency because i linked up with that when i started cycling further to go to work .,science
and i always thought youve got to know what you are facing wind rain sleet whatever .,science
because ive never been in ice and all these thing before .,science
but yeah they filled u full of it the whole week .,science
and then the storm hit and we are still waiting for the storm to hit .,science
and that wa the storm .,science
and when i looked at my weather app we are sitting in a a shape this .,science
and this shape go that and it change .,science
but we are always inside this shape .,science
we did not get much of anything .,science
you were in the wind .,science
we were in somewhere between thirty five to fifty five mile and over wind .,science
and in south africa they had a saying if your dustbin is not in the next street then it wasnt a storm .,science
it wasnt the southeast .,science
i thought ive still got off of how many bin .,science
and weve got six of them seven eight .,science
ive still got them all .,science
thats a good count .,science
because thats all of my animal .,science
i wa panicking about the weather .,science
and then also wa it yesterday or today ?,science
i took picture of the goose and maria wa also commenting on our feed that they sound very distressed .,science
now the bird were it looked the form of an opacity going over how she affect the sky .,science
she wa over to the of me here .,science
and the bird were underneath her doing these figure of eight big cloud of them under there .,science
and you could i seen that the first time and i thought look at that .,science
these bird are doing this massive massive thing .,science
and these are goose doing that ?,science
thats the case .,science
we are doing that .,science
it is they did not know where they were going and they were severely agitated because maria being sensitive she is to that with what she said to me she know animal .,science
she said that they felt to me even in a video that i am not even in the environment but they feel agitated severely agitated where are we going ?,science
and it is obviously affecting the gps .,science
this electrical thats happening is very random .,science
it seems even the weather apps will one minute tell you one thing and then you go back and it is changed within the thirty minute .,science
you are they are not taking into account the passing body and the weather that they call u and the asteroid below them and all of that and planetary none of that is taken into account .,science
everybody ha to connect to science and they wonder why their equation do not work anymore .,science
nicole wa talking about this .,science
the sahara rebecca had it posted there for a minute .,science
she pulled it down .,science
the sahara desert ha not always been it is .,science
yeah shes .,science
they talk about the yds and all that in the egyptian .,science
in the early egyptian dynasty that wa on .,science
they are finally coming to term with some of the stone even in the pyramid etc .,science
are concrete poured using limestone rather than carved .,science
and yeah they are finally starting to discover there a whole bunch of stuff going on that they did not look at properly because they do not grant technology to reality .,science
they granted to the western science and western science say this and anything outside that people do not talk about because then they lose accreditation and then lose their their respectability in the science community blah blah blah .,science
and we never we never worry about that here .,science
i had a friend of some matter of fact .,science
why do not you write this paper and turn it into the academy of science they can debate it with you .,science
and i went yeah stick my head in the guillotine .,science
you bet i want to raise a flag to me going if you do not know about me then i do not want you to .,science
but yeah the sahara desert wa not always what the sahara desert look now .,science
and this wa a bunch of sand that blew in from the far east .,science
and that all had to do with climate change since the last cycle .,science
and all of that dust and everything theyd have to do a lot of check .,science
but if you go down deep enough to find different color of sand from different era and different area where it blow in through the atmosphere from other region .,science
and you have to remember mountain range used to be taller and they get worn down .,science
and they now one of the greatest content on earth is silica .,science
and silica doesnt break down .,science
and a lot of our sand is silica .,science
and you can you anyway there there a whole research topic on that .,science
but you look at sand under the microscope .,science
thats also another wonder is not it ?,science
and whats the difference between sea sand and desert sand ?,science
there a big difference between that .,science
and ocean sand for example some sand you can not use in cement some sand you can use .,science
the sand you can use in cement is on very short supply believe it or not .,science
it is we do not have a lot of that available on planet earth anymore .,science
because weve been using it all up .,science
and thats a topic you can look up a . thats an interesting dive down a new rabbit hole .,science
but anyway i digress .,science
are you ready to kick them off there rebecca ?,science
let i am going to try that clip again and see if it will let me play it .,science
and yeah you are welcome nicole .,science
you are welcome .,science
for sure .,science
let give it a go one more time and cross my finger .,science
come on boy .,science
it say the browser your browser is having trouble sharing your video .,science
if anybody can find a way around something itd be me .,science
let look at christopher video .,science
they are good .,science
let start the show with christopher .,science
and hopefully it show .,science
let try it again during the week .,science
i am earlier i wa saying all we have to do is watch christopher video and then we can go home because he said it all .,science
we do not even need to do a show .,science
watch christopher video. . well go home .,science
the mini mini show .,science
click on those .,science
we know they are some of them are working for you. . i know .,science
i am going to resave it and try it again .,science
i even the type .,science
yeah look at that thing .,science
yeah the line are even exactly .,science
they are it .,science
i am telling you you put the overlay on .,science
it is it is perfect .,science
it is incredible .,science
it is i took the paper and traced over the top of it .,science
and i did not of course i do not even have any tracing paper .,science
i put that on my shopping list .,science
i forgot about this .,science
this wa weird .,science
i wa trying to find web cam to see if maybe my find some good one .,science
but what wa that ?,science
i remember you asked what that wa .,science
that that thats the tan asteroid .,science
thats what i thought .,science
that that illumination on the left is the tan asteroid .,science
i could see i sat him in uri and then i thought that ha to be an asteroid or .,science
and i sent to answer you on that on your video when i saw it .,science
and i clicked off of it and did not answer you .,science
yeah i saw that the other day .,science
and yeah thats the tan asteroid illuminating .,science
it is going to get facially illuminated more .,science
yeah there .,science
that big left blob there .,science
that is the bottom of the tan asteroid and the salamander asteroid coming into around the rotational a uri orbit or rotates i should say and rise .,science
and a it rotates those asteroid which are slowly angling out of the bottom of uri in the in the gas cloud mix pop out and then they become illuminated .,science
and weve seen it year ago a . and it is back to being the cycle and october and it is going to be illuminated .,science
i played this one much .,science
it is perfect .,science
it is the sky get wild here .,science
it is rebecca sky .,science
there nothing .,science
and then when we do get something happening it blow up .,science
yeah. . sorry chris .,science
you can see it with your own eye .,science
it is clouding on all .,science
nobody will use it or leave the planet in sound .,science
shes a red asteroid there in this shot .,science
behind the death guy .,science
it is it is there no doubt in my mind now .,science
it is for many month i kept doubting it .,science
and i do not know why my brain would not allow me to accept it at all .,science
we still argue with it .,science
everybody argues with this over and over again .,science
it is not what we normally .,science
yeah when have you ever seen a sky that or that ?,science
yeah or that .,science
look at that .,science
and then ive got curve man .,science
i remember that one .,science
that shot is from two thousand and thirteen or fourteen .,science
thats the lead asteroid crossing in front of the summit a few year ago .,science
this of course two thousand and eighteen .,science
this is twenty .,science
it is two thousand and twenty two thousand and twenty one .,science
and it blow your mind to think that they are that .,science
and how could this possibly be ?,science
but it is over and over .,science
i have it that they are they are close and the fact that they travel close together to it doesnt .,science
i guess there can be a thats normal because .,science
there could be many different combination of how the planet can travel together and all sort of solar system .,science
i think our out view is partially magnified .,science
it is looking through a glass of water .,science
yeah it is the fishbowl effect .,science
yeah because i saw it in in your video in the coal video and everything these planet look they are immediately next to each other and there no way they that they can be .,science
and yet in our out view this light pincher this is shining between the planet .,science
nothing else can do that .,science
suddenly doesnt suddenly change shape in the sky unless there something cutting it off .,science
between u and the sun .,science
more information on the binary twin solar system .,science
follow the beer follower anonymous .,science
and it happens over and over and now if it wa a one time thing all we saw this and wed go yeah it is clouds. . but we see this every day month in month out year in year out .,science
we watch the progression .,science
the drawing perfectly match all the time .,science
my accuracy rate is scary .,science
and it even bother me because i am that accurate .,science
and all i do is draw out of what i see in my head .,science
i can imagine how you feel sometimes .,science
i there day that i sit there and i shake my head and go wow .,science
and then there day that i shake my head and go god i hope i am doing this . . i think you are .,science
i think we can say you are definitely a. if it aint broken .,science
it is broken. . i do have a lot of stress from this though .,science
i do not want this to be happening .,science
but it is .,science
i do not want to have happening what i see is coming .,science
and it is .,science
it is spooky what we are headed to .,science
it is only going to work .,science
i had that dread feeling yesterday .,science
i think i would be glad when the when this .,science
election season is over to .,science
i think everybody i think everybody on the planet is under an excruciating amount of stress now from the planetary body going by and the asteroid going by and the electrical .,science
increase thats going on from the x cloud .,science
we have another x class to flare today .,science
thatll be hitting u in a day or two .,science
it is only a two but itll still itll it is an x class .,science
it is going to it is going to .,science
somebody saying it wa a three.three that leah fox lady .,science
she get a little bit carried away and worry a little bit much .,science
not that she doesnt do a good job but shes a little bit overly concerned .,science
or thats how i take it .,science
this is of course merely my opinion .,science
there could be an entirely different story to it anyway .,science
yeah i think we are i think all of u are feeling the planet .,science
i think a lot of u are sick to our stomach .,science
a lot of u our ear are ringing .,science
we are having new ache and pain new emotional trouble .,science
there these all these deep dark old hidden lost long ago faux pa in our past that are burping up in our lap every day .,science
and thinking about thing that we never even wanted to remember and yet here they come back to haunt u and there a lot of that going on .,science
and i am experiencing it a . and i try to work my way through it and go it is .,science
it is .,science
it is something you are you are clearing the shelf .,science
you are going to get through this .,science
this is a positive thing .,science
but i think we are all feeling some unusual very uncomfortable feeling around the world .,science
i think everybody is feeling this .,science
some some question from audrey in south africa .,science
shes got somebody asking her thing about the planet .,science
she say please ask sam a question for me .,science
a friend of mine asked me if it wa possible for a solar system to have one group of planet and two sun .,science
no it is possible .,science
depending on the proximity .,science
now there are sun .,science
there are star out there that that new star are embedded partially sticking out of old star .,science
there all kind of different way the star can can facilitate .,science
they can be closely binary attached with one solar system .,science
i would imagine it is possible .,science
but generically it ha to do with then youd have to be looking at a two atom atomic structure with very low protein .,science
and there are low count of neutron and electron .,science
it would be an early it would be a very early solar system because it would continue to add to the compounding a long a it is within it chemistry constraint .,science
and yeah yeah there all there billion of solar system .,science
yeah you can have any variation there. . high group of star distant star star that orbit around each other very vastly different but yet they are vastly far apart from each other .,science
and yet they are still electrically attached because of whatever compound .,science
i am sure that there solar system out there with four star or five star live atom four atom three atom two atom .,science
it is a rarity to have one star and one solar system .,science
it is only eighty three not yet seventeen .,science
and the billion of different possible equation than seventeen of them can have one or two star and beyond .,science
watch carl stegen in the billion and billion of star .,science
and thats probably a small estimate number two .,science
not all that .,science
they are finding out how little they do know .,science
here they are talking about they think the universe the big bang and all is eight point .,science
you get two scientist in the room and they do not even agree on the date .,science
but anyway eight.six eight.two billion year old .,science
we talked about this last week on last show .,science
and here theyve discovered a star that is twelve.six billion year old .,science
excuse me it show you how little you do know .,science
now remember everything we are looking at is all shit in the past .,science
all the light took all these millennium to get here .,science
we do not even have an abject out view of reality .,science
we are looking at only light emitted in the past .,science
we do not even have a concept of the now in space and they are stumbling and going yeah we know we know no you do not .,science
but if you are big if you are piggybacking off einstein and gravity then you do not know .,science
it is that simple .,science
maybe some of your equation work but the rest of them do not .,science
and then they go the heisenberg uncertainty principle because if we watch our experiment they are not going to come out .,science
no no thats an excuse .,science
you get your paycheck next month .,science
and that wa one thousand eight hundred and eighty and we are still running out of it .,science
i got to keep teaching a a college professor .,science
because i watched my experiment it did not turn out .,science
yeah and then they say the science is correct .,science
no the science is not correct .,science
there is much more going on than that .,science
we live in an electrical universe atomic structure atom proton neutron electron .,science
what work in the subatomic also work in the athroatomic .,science
and that is the mission the missing link that einstein couldnt fathom .,science
and that is the unification model .,science
what work in chemistry subatomic to asterotomic one set of rule .,science
thats simple .,science
and anything more complicated is it is absurd .,science
it is ridiculous .,science
it is simpler than that .,science
and thats why they are missing it because it is there .,science
he also had a question about that step .,science
there this picture that you always show u this the king pointing at the thing in the heaven .,science
love that .,science
you wanted you to describe what those object are that he pointing at again .,science
well point at the second object up .,science
on the left hand side .,science
thats the lead object in the asteroid object cluster group .,science
i said that wa the cluster group there .,science
we have early year the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and nineteen picture on that hopi picture .,science
yes that rebecca showed a few minute ago in your video i believe christopher that white everybody think is a watermark .,science
no thats the illuminated object cluster group .,science
and thats thats the second icon on the left that he pointing to .,science
and the bigger one of course would be yuri and attu below it .,science
and then you go up and there a square on that a up toward the top there in the middle .,science
and that would be the cube .,science
and speaking of the cube a fun .,science
i posted a awesome photograph this last two day or because i got it today .,science
ill get that .,science
he got some incredible picture this week .,science
yeah that wa the lead asteroid wasnt it that monster on the ?,science
no the one the picture i am talking about a font capture the two cube parked next to each other .,science
and the text is cube were in the same shot one next to the other .,science
and i did not comment on the on his page about that because i did not want to stick my neck too far out .,science
but i guess i am publicly doing that in voice .,science
there are time i say something and other time i hold my tongue until i think about it for a while .,science
and usually ill come back to think two or three time and look at something .,science
but i looked at it a couple of time today already and i went my god thats both cube .,science
bear with me .,science
and yeah i have it ready to say i wa getting ready to do that .,science
but ill go ahead and get that finished up .,science
i do have jillians picture ready .,science
i make sure i got him saying though i say i have them ready but i sent them over .,science
let see if they are here .,science
with that we should see some interesting glory again here tomorrow or .,science
id have to look up when that wave is going to hit u . great .,science
i do not know if i could take any more .,science
yeah we do feel we do feel the field effect on the earth .,science
there are more earthquake .,science
there is more electrical activity .,science
our internet service go down a radio wave service radio in your car stereo go off .,science
the light at work were fluttering too .,science
light and work or generator will burn out .,science
people have already forgotten the one that one flare that we had huge that affected the hoover dam .,science
one of their transformer burned out during one of those .,science
and they are going pop all over the world .,science
but we do not see those video .,science
those generator are blowing up all around thailand and malaysia and germany and turkey and afghanistan or poland .,science
we do not see those video because nobody slap the puzzle piece together .,science
all these electrical generator and dam are blowing up or this generator blow up or that generator blow up .,science
and they do not connect the dot .,science
and if you started studying and had a google list or an ai check that information for you .,science
you could probably find out that during the solar player lot of other shit is happening including earthquake and volcano and your home computer and your cell phone and your cable tv are all messed up .,science
and i think sound ha a great deal to do with that a . that reminds me of this clip sam two thousand and eighteen .,science
this is december two thousand and eighteen .,science
and i remember it .,science
i will shoot a heaven with three quarter of star in his tail thats speaking .,science
anyway that and i remember this wa happening and an opacity is there .,science
and within minute the medium wa all over this say and blown transformer a transformer .,science
do not pay any attention .,science
but they are not acknowledging whats going on .,science
you can not miss that .,science
youve got to say something .,science
boy they are winning on tv .,science
i remember this pic very .,science
ive seen it a few hundred time .,science
i have a copy of it .,science
and i never swallowed the full entire what this wa .,science
and i am highly tempted to still go .,science
i am torn in two direction .,science
it is either the eye on tail off the face of a satin or it is the star destroyer all illuminating in front of the long box cube .,science
what ? .,science
ive never seen anything that since .,science
there i wa i wa going to be direct .,science
and the only thing that could illuminate this with that many dot is the green asteroid and that is not the green asteroid. . and it and i i am torn .,science
fifty forty five of me say it is at the michelle amoon eye on tail somehow and some odd illumination .,science
and the other fifty fifty five go to those are the star destroyer offloading around the long box cube and they are being eliminated from underneath .,science
because of the randomness of it especially the one two three four five six over to the there. . and if you blow that up i can make it bigger .,science
and what i am looking at here one second .,science
they do look very triangular .,science
they do .,science
and i never wanted to go there because i couldnt i couldnt care between the saturn jellomoon eye on tail and or asteroid or star destroyer .,science
but i i am more prone to star destroyer parked around the long box cube .,science
it is we try to go through the option of what it could be what we based on what weve seen in the past based on what we know is where .,science
and this one always i wa never completely comfortable with what i am looking at .,science
and yes the green area is bottom illuminated core of planet nepacity and it is glowing .,science
and wa during a solar burst the bottom of the planet will pulsate and glow in from the stellar material .,science
it is the aurora borealis on our north pole but thats the aurora borealis on the southern pole of planet nepacity .,science
and everybody know that the planet ever since the second star got here all of a sudden there been hexagon and aurora at the pole both north and south pole of saturn and uranus and venus and jupiter and mercury and earth .,science
weve had glowing crown and a growing glowing south pole .,science
and of course they are not showing you those picture .,science
yeah thats a fawn .,science
look at that .,science
longbox cube and the texas cube parked next to each other .,science
the longbox is in front and the much bigger texas cube is behind it .,science
that blow me away .,science
what doe that mean when they park next to each other ?,science
or is that happens to be the out view ?,science
or are they that close ?,science
or is it invasion time ?,science
and i do not want to go there .,science
look at the side orb .,science
look at that .,science
my gosh that is clean a day .,science
there is no doubt about it .,science
alls under the criterion doesnt it ?,science
and we know the ship .,science
and that video that i do not know which one of you guy made the et video .,science
the excerpt of me going hey guy by the way ets here .,science
by the way guy ets here .,science
thank you afon for showing u more evidence .,science
thank you patrick .,science
also thank you patrick .,science
thank you .,science
it is good to see you again too .,science
i wa watching at some thing and it is been a few month .,science
good to see you patrick .,science
appreciate that .,science
i wonder what they being up on these big massive intergalactic square craft i wonder what their view of u is looking down on her and it is probably vacation to them .,science
we get to go to another planet and see new thing .,science
hey it is ricolette .,science
thank you .,science
thats nice .,science
thank you .,science
thank you .,science
thank you .,science
did that ?,science
look at that .,science
hello lead asteroid .,science
let go back .,science
let go back .,science
yeah these are both those two video are both from afon and now the eaves .,science
thats it is atom yellow moon is the dark area and then the light blue behind it is it is atom .,science
and there the lead asteroid .,science
this is a couple of day ago .,science
this is a week ago .,science
thats crazy .,science
i want to pull your drawing set .,science
except for going the opposite direction of what weve ever seen it before .,science
yeah this is going downward but that one coming in from the which is what which is whats most gruey about the lead asteroid being way way out .,science
and there are time i want to call it it own planet .,science
there time i want to say it is a moon .,science
but that is the second object up in that drawing or the or the cartouche of king david pointing his finger up into the sky warning people .,science
he pointing to it .,science
he telling you they are coming .,science
i know if you look at that picture that way but thats the object that is the second icon up with the little tail behind it .,science
because originally when it got here the lead asteroid wa thats why we call it the lead asteroid because it wa in front of everything .,science
thats what we saw first .,science
and then after a while we realized hey look there dark blob behind these object in the object cluster group .,science
and thats when we went shit those are planet .,science
and then it it escalated from there going you get god you can see you can blow it up .,science
and that wa two thousand and nine to two thousand and eleven .,science
that photo should be making worldwide news a far a i am concerned .,science
it is an absolute absolutely .,science
people should be tracking it all over the place and seeing where it is all the time .,science
that could be on time news .,science
how come it is not ?,science
i am going to go through the trail of it again there. . i wa going to say do that sam ?,science
it look it is moving in front of our eye there .,science
look at that .,science
which say which tell you asteroid because asteroid leave the trail behind them and planet do not .,science
now planet leave ion spiral behind them through their pathway especially famously inificity because it is such a small planet that it doe have an interaction between the larger planet in our planet and it creates this illumination ion cloud piggy tail a it drop a it move .,science
we saw that year ago .,science
we havent seen that recently because i had to do with angle of light and all that versus the sun .,science
now yeah thats the site of yuri there .,science
that is the side of his atom or yeah or no that might be the city coming over and in front .,science
i do not know there there a planet there .,science
there a thats thats awesome those are not those are not our cloud those cloud are not in our atmosphere .,science
look at the size of them hello all you space cruiser up there look at all of those star destroyer i know david one of bond material various people on facebook .,science
yeah on in there in our group people that were in the group yeah yeah look at those those are object those are planet guy .,science
this is this is uk yeah this wa in the uk yesterday yeah this week ha been bizarre it is been the cloud open up at certain time and all this crazy stuff it look see the of a surface out tipped axis .,science
thats you wow great ?,science
and in the stripe we see the gas thats the same a the base cloud of yuri the picture before this one this one i can not go back .,science
this one .,science
i have to look back yeah thats the base cloud of your coming in from the last tip tack .,science
they are not our cloud .,science
they are angled whereas yuris are horizontal but at two are good .,science
what fit stay and only through all of this participation from member around the world were we able to get to the stage we are today ?,science
yeah it is taken what fifteen year almost we are gon na be april april next year. . yeah .,science
yeah april night .,science
believe it or not here is a video clip april night .,science

there is that stripe .,science
it is there i can even blow it up even bigger here .,science
there it is .,science
there it is .,science
my god and it is prominent at sunset and it is huge now and ive said it doesnt time before weve never seen isatum a close to u ever before on their first original approach two thousand and fifteen sixteen seventeen and then exiting in eighteen nineteen etc .,science
and then coming back toward u in two thousand and twenty one twenty two twenty three etc this is the closest weve ever seen a satum the satums yellow moon and every day is new .,science
it is awesome awesome and my god some of those picture last week and that big red thing and everybody in the middle east and and the mediterranean and and and jordan and saudi arabia .,science
they are getting these orange shot and and all these beautiful red sky and everything and it is very intense very insane now the picture on the top left is a week before this drawing on the bottom left but that is whats going on a ?,science
i did not use that drawing in my head .,science
although i do i do think that is one of the best drawing or the best picture capture weve gotten in a very long time .,science
this is the upper one or excuse me upper left one .,science
thats an awesome awesome shot of a satum a shallow moon in front of a satum and then on top of it lead asteroid is also there and i hadnt even imagine that when i saw that picture and now that we see that comparison .,science
yes a a matter of fact it is there .,science
maybe maybe the skull asteroid going to be red and scary invisible in the sky wouldnt that be cool ?,science
well put in our requisition for that or here now writing it down on paper mailing it to the maybe mailing it to the space god .,science
this is my request october 31st .,science
id to see a very large very massively huge red skull asteroid visible of the world to see in the wind god wouldnt that be cool ?,science
yeah it is fascinating four series of video and fourteen year worth of work and thousand and thousand of sighting over hundred of thousand of sighting over fourteen year million of sighting .,science
it is wormwood and i did not go there for year because i did not want to freak out any little old lady and where would the destroyer coming in ?,science
yeah guy this shit real and these are damn close and and wormwood the destroyer or the dragon because it is the year of the dragon thats why it is the year of the dragon because it is sticklyclimatching reality thats in the last eight zero year .,science
anyway and this is all real and it is all real .,science
it is all real .,science
it is all real yeah look at the light cut off and yet on the left hand upper picture you are seeing this look a blue sky to me but why is the sun doing that ?,science
look it is got laser beam blue light coming at it .,science
i these are some of the best one the best picture the best of the best yeah this is of course this this is satan jala moon being illuminated here in this shot good and this is .,science
that is that is a massive massive sky filler and you should have seen the never ruin two thousand and twelve .,science
it wa still huge and yet it wa far away and i am sitting here watching it out in my front yard i am going there .,science
look at that .,science
it is there .,science
it is real and and the the sad thing is there many people missed out on the early year my god you guy have missed wow there an early one too .,science
this is what i do not know the year on this one look at that .,science
no this is two thousand and twenty two and that is a very rounded is satum and then a much smaller satum yellow moon and along the way there and there a couple of star destroyer or the middle yeah look at that yeah wow upper top up there .,science
there a couple star destroyer yeah and they are there .,science
look the stripe of yuri or you look on the hand side .,science
yeah yeah but still there the lead asteroid the lead asteroid is that little white blip next to the f for the the loop of of the of the watermark on that picture where it say two thousand and seventeen five that white blip is the lead asteroid .,science
wow and yeah and this again. . this is year later .,science
there a planet there .,science
there a planet there and it is rounding these planet the same thing again .,science
yeah wow yuri is very excuse me nepecity is a very small planet .,science
they they also they cut that they cut the sharing of the link .,science
you couldnt share the link after a while .,science
i am it is cop drop time off drop number one recall yeah i wa gon na add to robs question .,science
the internet it is been scrubbed there used to be video i wa trying to find one now but at least four year ago .,science
china went completely dark .,science
dark three of the afternoon and it wa darkest night it is on it is and russia had an episode maybe two thousand and nineteen somewhere in there .,science
yeah we had we had it up here in montana .,science
wow we had it did not go completely dark .,science
it is not nearly you try to find the video they are gone .,science
yeah it is very hard to find the video .,science
yeah the last time i looked for them here what i had to do i went to google because youtube tick tock .,science
yeah and you can go to dark dark go a i think i had my video ready .,science
remember that video wa trying to show you all yep clear sky let see if it work this time wait let do this one first .,science
sam can you explain whats happening here ?,science
i have people asking here whats going on ?,science

i think i saw i think they said they were in a park somewhere it look they are outside walking their baby or something that or their child is holding me now i am looking at the street .,science
boy thats keep moving people buy tripod yeah definitely they are on your plan man .,science
they are the same size and i am gon na scream glass double yeah now that white dot next to the moon we can talk about that that could be multiple dot .,science
i do not i have to relook that up but yeah .,science
wa it two month ?,science
yeah it is it is for fifty six day or something that .,science
i thought lense flare or whatever moved yeah when you have similar size that scream and now they do not they do not have the same intensity .,science
you want to see what jillian caught ?,science
yeah let pull that up here .,science
yes here we go a little shiny nose riddle look at that lovely orange wow you look at that if you turn that upside down thats a surface but it is our moon .,science
it is behind our moon .,science
how can something be that big ?,science
because they are it is that big behind our moon .,science
yeah these are very large planet and we are these tiny we are we are this tiny little rock earth we are not even a water type planet .,science
we are a rock type planet and the fact that we are covered in water is by luck .,science
yeah look at that asteroid yeah i can not i can not tell where the sun is coming from if i can not tell you which one that is but yeah that could easily be the red out whats the time to the of that ?,science
look somethings coming out of the middle but then when you look at it it for a little bit longer you can tell very cool yeah it wa weird .,science
now above a dead center would be above would be the bottom of that too that is the side of urie there with the tan asteroid and the other asteroid to the left of the sun yeah my ring doorbell cool cool look at that .,science
you are one of them rich people. ?,science
you got one of them ring doorbell i do not have any none of that technology you do not have you one then remember no my cave doesnt come with them up here in my montana cave i got a bear skin and stone knife man .,science
look at that that of course is the side of a satium satium jello moon that bear is of course the stripe of urie with the asteroid coming in from the upper left going down to the center you could see the shadow line .,science
look at that beautiful look at that one .,science
yeah weve asked at the jello moon and satium all on the everything else on the left the tim is probably cutting in in the back view here up to the left of the upper left of the sun .,science
yeah a little grayish different color circle there and that is the bottom of atu and atus moon and again bottom of atu atus moon .,science
yeah they were active this week .,science
you can see it .,science
you can see the thing thats getting smaller too it is getting smaller you can see it here again there the white of atus moon in front of at purple atu .,science
thats a band of asteroid there whole cluster of them yeah look at them at the base cloud of urie youve seen that over and over and over and over again ive drawn it a hundred time yeah it wa making the animal i heard a bird .,science
no i am joking yes the goose are are more plentiful this year here .,science
we saw goose this year .,science
i havent seen goose in year which is weird for montana because we normally have a lot of goose and there some bonkers we are going bonkers under these great big planet i am sure that all the animal are feeling it .,science

let see what they i do not remember whats on it it is been a while it is not all bottom of urie yeah here is not that grumpy there ?,science
yeah it is being illuminated and it is after sunset .,science
thats the bottom of urie being shined on it is in space .,science
what are we gon na do ?,science
i wa not going to but that is a rocket that is a rocket yeah spiral do not the the direction change spiral and it is spiraling .,science
yeah thats a rocket i that look an eye on tail illumination off the bottom of planet that too wow look at that .,science
hey whats that ?,science
maybe it is a light show .,science
yeah id say light show i weird it is flat up top must be cut off above by something in the way and then the question is is that the red asteroid going in front of the sun ?,science
see how the white light green blue the top of the sun is being visually out view cut off cropped on the top by planet seru wow that is crazy .,science
thats a good one in it .,science
wow nice i havent seen this one yet either .,science
i hadnt seen pretty surprising either usually when something hit this it is everywhere .,science
yeah yeah yeah i am eighty seven people posted it .,science
yeah yeah i found this on facebook .,science
i found this on youtube is i wa wondering if that wa the ion tail what did this thing in front of u here ?,science
nice itll get back .,science
boy thats it lead asteroid now above the boat going downward drawing and the ion tail is the white one at the horizon further to the thats the ion tail there it is flattening out because it is close it is close to our earth atmosphere .,science
it is absolutely flattening out on our upper atmosphere thats the ion it look flat that .,science
look at the green there and hi there in the past city yeah the opacity is there and then at two and at two moon are to the but the green is substantially shown i am very boy .,science
look at that .,science
thats the red asteroid again .,science
yeah we know that one .,science
hey sam pretty .,science
yeah i i now saw this question from wendy and about that asteroid in front of the sun with a flat on top she is asking how do that it wa saru ?,science
is that from a viewing ?,science
this is the base plate of asatoms yellow moon being illuminated from underneath lovely .,science
thats a normal tornado .,science
this is where the planet do not crash into each other they electrically repel look at that .,science
look at that red i yee look at that i wonder if it is a base cloud close pas from his satum .,science
look at that .,science
id never seen that before wow sir one two three thats a very angry looking it is nail foot bottom of that two bad two moon it is a pixie slipper .,science
yeah yep or a slimy little snail foot and bubbly bubbly look how orange that is thats a satum yellow moon and his satum and the long box cube is in there or something .,science
is that the space tube up close ?,science
look at that tube thing .,science
there an example look the whole everythings dark and it is not sunset yet it is an hour look at this .,science
it is not very visible i am thinking two thousand and twenty one yeah thats about that wa when nepecity wa dead center at the time .,science
look how gorgeous up that is beautiful underneath the bottom of urie again with weird gaseous formation of of asteroid and bubble it could never be a real sam .,science
it look that we dog handle bar thing ive seen that coming towards u in south africa little dog handle bar thing nothing those are not thats not within our atmosphere .,science
this is the atmosphere of a close passing planet and if you look at the sky there no cloud on the even on the horizon that wa a double the double rainbow mean there two sun doesnt it ?,science
yep amazing yeah i seen that above u during storm ashley a when larger one smaller i stared these for year and i kept going .,science
it is the only reason there a dark ring in the middle because normally a rainbow wouldnt do that now look for your pot of gold indeed i see weve lost rebecca .,science

mm i the music remember look at the dark area first there a light cut in coming in off the that is the red asteroid going horizontally from upper to lower left .,science
look at that in front of at these moon we are seeing direction of the asteroid moving in way we have never seen them before they are coming from the upper and going leftward .,science
wow thats interesting thats unusual i would bet money that is long box cube related .,science
i bet thats the side orb with a dragoff cloud ?,science
it should be where my tim is somewhere in there should be my tim that should be my tim there .,science
you are looking at the back shadow of thats why it is darker i wonder what he ha there that the moon ha been sighted next to the sun recently during the day and at sunset be prepared for that .,science
but i thought it wa on the hand side that would be where the side of urie would be there .,science
thats why it is dark there is urie dark dark dark area at sunset .,science
yeah it wa keep going and move .,science
yeah and bright that .,science
wow yeah shimmering it is rolling tumbling hot thats hot it is not what it is .,science
it is sunlight shining underneath after sunset and it is being illuminated because it is semiclosed i do not know .,science
yeah they are hard to find i do not people will buy them up off the shelf .,science
theyll empty the shelf to get them on a scale of one to ten it wa a twelve .,science
it wa all i could do is put a little cover over my head and try to sleep now were you drinking red wine or having any other sulfide or nitrate ?,science

why is it not there ?,science
here it is i thats a picture from vega this is i heard you last episode talking about how nostalgic you get about two thousand and eighteen seven add to i am the same way i am gon na have to go with that to being my favorite plan .,science
i i the opacity but it is a little more destructive than that too .,science
i am gon na have to yeah wow phenomenal this is a very rare occurrence .,science
i have not seen anything the like of this since two thousand and eighteen but god it wa awesome to see that .,science
yeah at two moon wa huge and close for long and and you we couldnt deny the purple in the orange scenario that wa going on .,science
look at that bubbly bottom that is this is the same thing one of thems in real time .,science
the other one is time lapse on a different camera but look at that both camera will show you exactly whats happening over the top of you .,science
it is one of those day where you what the hell man ?,science
why is nobody seeing this ?,science
this one recent sam .,science
this wa i do not know maybe five day ago but if there two there two asterisk one above the other and they are coming in they are coming in from the and headed left are not they ?,science
yeah yeah i i even recorded the trail that it leaf ?,science
youll youll see it here shortly but i recorded the trail a it wa a it wa wow i i did not get it till it did not occur to me .,science
i wa i i took this video and then i sat down outside on my porch and i wa holy crap i think this would be great time to record it and time lapse it and are you sure those are asteroid ?,science
i do not know what yeah what if we were looking at ive been looking at it for day and i the bottom one is the ion con trail behind the side orb and the one above it is the long box view see here a tight .,science
here a time lapse .,science
the trail going by yeah i held my camera for ten minute on my hand there to get that trail .,science
thats wa why it is a little unsteady .,science
i know there wa more that wa being thats obvious to there star destroyer in front of the long box cube there a side of the sun. . last time that i took yeah it is not the spiral astral .,science
gotcha not my last race far there wa a lot of stuff flying around that day .,science
this wa early on this wa a a thicker spiral they would have a thicker more notable spiral .,science
youd see the spiral .,science
i would have not have guessed that i would not have did did a font ?,science
can you find that again ?,science
i saw what he posted seven hour ago .,science
that wa freaking close they are part reach up there and touch it absolutely phenomenal .,science
yeah this one .,science
i saw this one .,science
i see two box there the darker one is the long box in front and the texas cube is behind they are next to each other .,science
the cube it look long it look two long box cube but it is not .,science
yes exactly the edge of the long box cube .,science
i know i i could be a third destroyer .,science
i could be wrong .,science
this is the closest ive ever seen yeah we are at the end of one hundred and eighty and they are over the top of u wow absolutely .,science
they are going by i havent had i the the planet sighting here have not been a prevalent .,science
it is asteroid that ive been seeing all over the place yeah asteroid look at that .,science
we are spinning by everyone .,science
that thing is that lead itll be a clear sky completely clear and then youll have the trail that .,science
i saw that wa the only the only thing in the sky which is why it drive me nut .,science

that wa it wa a great show and i of course said far too much it is i told too much offworld information .,science
i wanted there .,science
you said too much there wa some interesting thing that you touched on and i i want to hear more or at least because i googled a lot of it or some of it and i could have not find nothing on it .,science
thats an excellent movie .,science
do you watch it ?,science
i at least five time i do i i watch that i i watch it every often because i yeah i watch maybe fifty time already a lot .,science
i think it is fifteen foot by eighteen foot tall or something that or even bigger .,science
i know it is a very large petroglyph but people see only that photograph of it but that alone every time i look at it .,science
they are talking about it sam .,science
they are talking about the cube yeah it is been mentioned a lot more .,science
i think christ ha posted something on tiktok about the cube and and alexa .,science
three hundred and thirty three it wa it wa a very close .,science
it wa it is pretty old .,science
theyve got this monitor .,science
thats the worst thing that can happen to you .,science
no yeah a a matter of fact i can because i sat up on when during a skull surgery when they split the roof of my mouth open and they split my septum .,science
thats got ta be a crazy yeah to the answer i do not know .,science
and the sky is looking crazy now .,science
fifteen minute all can not wait .,science
ill be back .,science
can not wait our man on i wanted to ask you before we get off topic here psychologically i think a lot of people and you say this often which i i truly agree .,science
it is not a easy a take me with you .,science
no it is not it is but psychologically what did that do to you ?,science
you you are you are a strong minded person which i think any i think if anybody would be able to handle it be you but i i would imagine even to use something that it is a roller coaster ride .,science
have you lost your mind and is this something that you got that one ?,science
i think all of u may maybe i am not on that scale but i think any of u that are here seeing what we see feel on a daily basis .,science
it is a constant back and forth constant back and forth but the sky always reminds you that no you are not bat shit crazy .,science
i know that not everybody from my experience and i think everybody will agree here when i first understood this i wa very excited about sharing it with people thinking ill have to do a share it show them this video or this exciting and people will accept it .,science
in fact the fact that people wouldnt accept it it never crossed my mind .,science
i i live for those moment whatever come of it is extra because yeah i am enjoying it myself .,science
ive met some amazing group of people along the way we we have a family here .,science
we we all see the same thing .,science
itll drive you crazy i do it out of love out of loving watching the system .,science
it is god wow how could want to watch that ?,science
it is the most exciting thing ever yeah thats where i am at .,science
thats where i am at .,science
i i accept that not everybodys in acceptance i i post something in hope that we we find another terror another chris another it is such a huge letdown that nasa is not doing their part .,science
i want to remind everybody here that we we are at the the cutting edge of of of science unfortunately nasa is not come is not forthcoming and and we are the only one doing this .,science
we have to protect this information .,science
because anything can happen at any moment where they get to wipe u out .,science
whats happened to rebecca what your own two account now that have been wiped out ?,science
and and the more the more thing become obvious .,science
i think the more they are gon na mess with this because i do feel that they are messing with this ive been on youtube when i saw the our our view count go backwards ive seen that ive seen that .,science
i wouldnt be surprised if if we have a big asteroid event and people decided blame it on war a war act an act of war on some country because thats why of course though .,science
yeah of course the line .,science
yeah the thing is that that we we here here what i think about the difference between some of u here all of u here and most people in the world is that ?,science
i personally i live up there my mind is constantly thinking up there most people i see their peripheral vision their way of thinking it is all worldly .,science
it is all down here i do not think any of u lived out here a much a a the rest of the world .,science
i know you sam i i know most of u walk here with their head up high looking up at the sky constantly worldly thing have lost their appeal .,science
can you imagine how old your bone and finger would be ?,science
thats the way it work yeah i i feel you did not miss some stuff but some very cool stuff is about to happen it is happening and it is about to happen .,science
a they a they move away from whats happening ?,science
it is time to start looking at everywhere do the three hundred and sixty do not do the the ninety degree on one side ninety degree on the other do the one hundred and eighty look the other direction ?,science
it is called naviru system sky watcher thats the name of this ive been tagging it in all of my video .,science
ive been tagging it naviru system sky watcher and he said he almost there .,science
it is uphill and he a few minute away he sent me a message hey it is me and daddy poteet i think it is how you say that hi welcome .,science
i do not know if ive seen that name before .,science
nice but hi i seeing a new name new people .,science
welcome aboard thats exciting give it some time and he will be amazed at what we have the man other here for you guy it is fun andrea people often ask me why i havent had kid i think it is because i am done .,science

i am i am an old soul thats my story and i am sticking with it keep on trucking yeah yeah keep on trucking .,science
yeah thats an old 70 term .,science
i i i am in awe that this ha not look at that that miami exciting thing did look how crazy everybody went over that now granted .,science
nobody even talk about it anymore .,science
theyll be off the deck .,science
all of those are repeatedly captured and they match time after time after time and they are not the blob flying around in the sky that we can not identify when we call the oa to uap or ufo .,science
no we are having direct absolutely close capture from around the world for year now and i am wondering when people are going to either get on board with the fact now granted .,science
we want to hear your comment there two thing that get the the algorithm going and and one of those main one is comment guy .,science
it is not the like like how the view help but the comment are what get the algorithm going .,science
whether they are positive or negative i stopped deleting rude comment on my video because even those help i i ive come to a point where i am a long a you are interacting this push the algorithm to to send this out to more people .,science
i i i i let i let the hateful comment be i do not even i even respond back to them because it give me an opportunity to comment again i i reply back to the hateful a they are laughing .,science
ill be i am happy you are happy yourself but yeah positive or negative comment is helpful .,science
there no such thing a bad publicity a a comment .,science
it doesnt have to be a big elaborate count comment .,science
get the conversation going guy .,science
thats all it is about and then get people talking about this because we need to get people talking about it extra terrestrials are very very very real .,science
hey chris .,science
i tried to make it on time .,science

ive never walked this far up the mountain before wow and i know you do not know i think i know exactly where you are chris i am on the east side of la vega .,science
yeah i long box cube is there still there yeah it is there .,science
a lot of thing tricking by my friend .,science

thank you kenneth .,science
i wa i have new pain and thing that hurt me that ive never experienced before and it is are you kidding me ?,science
whats happening crap this is being sixty something .,science
joy everybody should try this .,science
it is fun the planet are i am not gon na say they are killing me but boy this is a thing to deal with man .,science
look the desert .,science
yeah you found the edge of the ground or the sky you are you were pointing it at the sky but i saw the sand i saw the sand dune .,science
i think this is probably the best spot i can find there whats that see that i do not know that streak thats curved and coming down is that anything in particular ?,science
it wa that a little bit more dead center that weird patch there dead center thats where the green asteroid is because it is got a little yeah and that by the way you can see the side of never what ?,science
yeah going keep going a little bit more no to your to your there .,science
thats where nabiru is and that this area there .,science
yeah there a big mountain in the way there wow no it look good finger and everything .,science
yeah thats there .,science
there a dark gray dot and thats about the size of what emel seru look .,science
it wasnt fast but the little moon nana going around concentrically around emel seru and it took a little time but you got to watch it plane this day and land mass in normal cloud this is there .,science
you are you are getting to a satum yellow moon and a satum at the sun there and then above that you notice how there these striped ray yeah they fan out .,science
it is red blue red yeah thats thats four or five day now at sunset .,science
yep that that graduated oval .,science
yeah here wow where seru is and then in front of seru to farther left is your re and above that and above you is out to an out to moon .,science
yeah and thats there .,science
thats that dark blue left corner with the stripe yeah you can see the stripe of urie yep i wish you guy were here because it is it is different when you are outside a opposed to the camera but look how fast it is changed already .,science
this is crazy yeah it doe it change and i love that you did that series roll in your video because it doe show the rotation and the movement and the and the change of the planet and you hadnt done that before and it is excellent work .,science
cool yeah ill try to keep doing that and then yeah that look an f16 going down but it is way too big to be an f16 going down there that plot that one little possible .,science
we got nellis air force base over here yeah but it doesnt move .,science
my god when that mig went over the valley you could hear it forever how do you own a mig ?,science
i i how do you get to fly it around populated area ?,science
yeah i i own a russian airplane it is not a big deal everybody doesnt everybody yeah i am gon na own a mig in in montana and fly it around .,science
i i have a little bit of money .,science
yeah no problem where do you get spare part for those damn thing jesus ?,science
theyve got an f thirty four now and an f thirty nine and all of this crazy shit that you could they got technology wouldnt believe look at that my god look at that there look at that white round .,science
yeah on that .,science
yeah there look at that white little dark object that would probably be god is that is that the lead asteroid heading downward with strange wow ?,science
or is it smaller than the lead asteroid but it definitely look something quite small and asteroid see the little rounded circle around it and you can see there another gosh there an edge that wrap all the way around the horizon .,science
it is strange is that the side orb of the long box cube ?,science
that would be nothing of the size for the side orb wed think that lead asteroid would be bigger .,science
that would have to be there that little c cloud i do not know over to the left of the corner there thats c yeah thats thats see that c yeah is that the side orb in front of the long box cube ?,science
man i think it the size is the long box cube ha moved since we saw it last from because it wa much more over this is northwest this is west it might have moved .,science
yeah i i can see two different color of blue you can see the depth there something there something absolutely passing over now .,science
yeah thats it is at the yellow moon .,science
then it is over here somewhere no higher up possibly possibly somewhere here go go look a little more upward and then go back to the left to see if somewhere in there is where it should be .,science
i think you are with the long box cube and the side orb here it definitely look strange it is changing to the sea cloud you can see the the edge of the bottom of the cube .,science
it is coming this way and the side orb is coming down that is wild and if people would pay attention for five minute to watch the sky for a few minute to see this our sky have completely changed .,science
yep go back over to the pole go back to the left you are youve already walked past it anyway yeah the edge of a satium a satium gel .,science
i am gon na see the color difference .,science
you would think that after sunset you would have normal illumination on both side of the sky but there there not it is you can see the edge of the planet here .,science
you can see the edge of urie yep at whose moon is above it ?,science
yep it is a big dark band here .,science
it is this light in the sky is cut off and then i sat him and the yellow moon are over here thats incredible .,science
yeah and it is out view which is screwing with your head yes and then you guy said nabiru is more to the north or sorry northeast .,science
yeah it is exactly .,science
let me see if i can take a picture here real quick the parking lot three hundred and sixty .,science
yeah we are getting that i love that walmart but we are doing the three hundred and sixty now me yeah you can see that see that line at the bottom at the i have to is that what is that ?,science
thats the eye on tail going around the satin jello moon which is very blue .,science
absolutely see it now thats incredible and that dark blue area is the satin yellow moon but the light blue area is satin but the gray is the open normal sky but yet still ha part of seru in the out view and is that a helicopter ?,science
yeah yeah for some reason i live over they they come from the grand canyon they go on tour out there and then they come back around this time and my street is their avenue .,science
joy yeah it only last for about ten minute and then you pick up all the stuff that fell off the shelf and and spilled coffee and all of that .,science
yeah i do not know anybody could live that it would drive me insane you come home all your everythings on the floor alter guy .,science
yeah yeah big shout out to slap tam .,science
ive been watching a lot of slap tam lately and the ghost and that summer real summer fake awesome shit .,science
yeah yeah it is it is not a not what i thought we were gon na see tonight but still it is the sun ha been down for at least twenty minute now .,science
yeah you can here .,science
you can see yeah how they are they are illuminated .,science
it is incredible and that illuminated area thats orange off the horizon at the center of the sun that is the bottom of serru why it is illuminated the way it is .,science
otherwise it would be dark yeah because when the sun go down it get dark .,science
yeah this shouldnt be yellow that for this long .,science
no because the sun is shining on the bottom of these close passing planet .,science
awesome yeah it is they are there and everybody i close me way .,science
no everybody take it for granted .,science
no ive noticed a lot of people this week have been taking picture of the sky one day i we came out of the store and at least four people at once i couldnt believe it .,science
whats going on here ?,science
you ask them what they were taking picture of the sky i did you ask them i i let them do their thing .,science
i thought i thought ill let them let them ponder for a minute .,science
there you go .,science
nicole typed in sam .,science
i captured a long thin selfilluminated crap lying above erie colorado .,science
i sent you a small clip and photo of it .,science
here is a copy of what she sent .,science
i will send to you rebecca .,science
it is a short small ufo yeah and and then there a second. . this is a picture of it wow with two others that look to be triangular crap and then a lander how interesting thank you nicole .,science
those are very viable capture cool .,science
no ill get ill get off of face .,science
whoop god i got ta go back to facebook because i have to send it still sam come on earthbrain .,science
there is i have to pull up rebecca again and send her did i not send that to you and i sent it to her to all berry .,science
i am sending that to rebecca and apparently i i sent it to you but it did not go weird all .,science
i will try it a second time i see what i get the first one say log in or sign up to view .,science
i hope you can she said she posted it to her page .,science
shell mean to see if i can if you want nicole you can send it to me too and i can send it to rebecca or if i post it ill grab a copy of it .,science
i do not know if you can open those i am looking on montana sky watcher .,science
i do not know this is on your pm it is on your pm .,science
thats another good one too .,science
i am gon na save those i am coming off of facebook now .,science
shes got the best view nittanys kitten is here hang on one second .,science
one moment yeah a ha got an orangey yellow open bottom floor all and it is there .,science
it is been there .,science
shes getting big i am in i am in no your name yeah saru ha been visible for a couple of month now .,science
i know shes cute older picture i can grab you a quick one nicole .,science
yes. . where is it ?,science
all this is it is playful .,science
you said it me another one .,science
yeah this is that one you have trouble with this one all the time .,science
i do not know you are you blink .,science
yeah here my folder one of them i have on sarah pick and then ill get the one that you sent me if i do not have it included but there your drawing the drawing seru we do not see that very often .,science
yeah there it is .,science
yeah that one look at that .,science
sorry i am i wa online yeah you are patching in and out but do not know what you are doing .,science
it is but anyway you can see the orange illumination on the outside and that is atmospheric illumination which is why it is orange on the much larger .,science
she wa glitching out to me .,science
it could be me anyway while we are waiting let all hum .,science
no i know well play ave maria .,science
all anybody who been watching pop politics with perhaps i can not think of any other reason .,science
sorry thats take care of something .,science
i am back thats the same .,science
here this one .,science
are we still on theory ?,science
yeah i probably changed it now .,science
yeah no i wa trying to think of a joke even and i i couldnt even think of any joke no .,science
yeah sorry i want to here the other one you sent me that one yeah now that is thats the big bass cloud bass cloud of seru in the early year .,science
this is two thousand and eleven .,science
yeah yeah it is it is very orange and very regular and some people all go it is the super super not this super do not glow this one doe from nicole it wa one picture .,science
is that ?,science
sam or no a video and a picture a video. . i do not see that yet .,science
here little video and a grainy and yet it show what it show and then she show you a still capture of of said same i will get it and well see it together copy hi all .,science
glass are crooked .,science
it is such a great actor .,science
i should memorize his name the guy it did what wa he doing ?,science
ernest p world ernest camp ernest go to school ernest halloween ernest yeah ernest thats tv commercial for sprite and seven up and all of this and different local bakery and you name it great great actor he of course ha passed on since almost 70 on it .,science
i he did a he did a great walter brennan .,science
i think one of the best walter brennans .,science
yeah i definitely remember now that you yeah the kid are going it is almost halloween and the youtube is full of nothing but halloween program .,science
ive in the troll the troll booker and all of that .,science
no ive unfortunately unfortunately you side show you distract me from this crazy world passing planet am i no thats not easy lately .,science
i am not even in finding the joy in my my older documentary about roam or any of the other stuff anymore .,science
it is and i weigh i want to see nirvana stuff and i can not even enjoy an et video anymore because these guy are talking about extraterrestrial and is nasa lying to u about this theyve all lost their meaning because we know better .,science
we know that they are here and anybody else is talking about their nose and we have you can not stand to listen to it .,science
you can not stand .,science
he doesnt i am not gon na say all yeah i got the video .,science
i am sending it to the computer now .,science
we having it in a second i know you can not get to that level of fame without being and that when you are that it is hard to trust anything coming from them .,science
i had the opportunity i had the opportunity to move hollywood .,science
i had i had a colombia recording artist contract offered to me quite a quite a deal of money per week even but i did not know how long it would last i i could be uprooted and be there for a month and then be sent home .,science
i wa taking care of the kid and then i turned down the offer and then within a few month even the kid wa gone and she took off with him .,science
that wa another long sad story that i went through with my son .,science
but anyway that wa the 90 ?,science
i feel some of u have had way more difficult life than a lot of people yeah i have i have a and and and a couple of scifi way more my life .,science
yeah healthy the adoption story alone doesnt make any sense i do not have that but i have enough look at that .,science
thats pretty cool .,science
i would be thinking that yeah yeah hey it happened there an it wa still shot .,science
that might be better to easier to see yeah before the before the thyroid cancer surgery .,science
you are dizzy a hell and the guy go i feel i must inform you there a fifty chance that you will not ever be able to speak again and it is and i looked out .,science
i this way i have gruff gravelly voice sometimes after first and twenty nine minute of talking yeah look at that .,science
i see two star destroyer because those are two upper dot are triangle i looked at them big on my screen here and the bottom one is a landercraft a disc that is the bottom one in a disc a disc yeah it is a flying saucer .,science
yeah it is a flying saucer disc .,science
thats mine huge a third one a third light on that .,science
there a fourth one and there other blob of color .,science
i am looking at the directory .,science
there all kind of stuff in here a little nuance .,science
see picture of dream light .,science
yeah yeah thats sure you can you can tell if the kid were affiliated with this those are definitely et craft need yeah cool picture go back to normal screen .,science
i need to get out and look at nighttime sky .,science
i have low low peak to my southwest and i can look up but not out anyway that sound nice though .,science
i live two mile .,science
let the two mile from downtown i am close to downtown .,science
you have a level of light pollution because you are in town you are looking up .,science
i know i wa looking at my list of what id done or not then but or what id yeah we are good .,science
whatever you want to do sam .,science
it is five hour thirty two minute i do not know what happened to christopher .,science
i do not know maybe his phone died i do not know if he said anything quite a while to go there thats true .,science
he still on his journey. . i did not want to miss him if i wa on the lookout for him .,science
tara say can you show my tara and two son ?,science
thats tara .,science
i have a slideshow of picture that she sent me i almost forgot tara .,science
sorry let me turn my music down we can pull her video .,science
i am running out of voice .,science
thats all i hear it .,science
i know what you are saying ive got one ricola left .,science
my gosh we are wrapping up after tara death i i still i am still good for it is more than a fact .,science
i have half of the other one still left that wa sitting on the deck did not even see it i can i can grab this ricola .,science
i am fine i i do not keep them in my mouth the whole way .,science
it is home sized and it is smaller than a coaster .,science
i put my cough drop on it it is perfect i wa sitting there .,science
it is it is something you are worried stone .,science
you are supposed to rub in your hand or whatever and it is a little it is got flat edge .,science
thats christopher .,science
he had cloud and whatnot but otherwise thats very much what he showed u there a green blue to it .,science
there you go how many picture wa there i wa talking about being attention i know you let start over it is not long going two minutes. . i apologize if everybody go we do not want to see it again .,science
i i wa currently talking we were talking about cough drop yeah yeah you are .,science
yeah i lost track .,science
god hey i remember now we were sun had been down twenty to thirty minute now that dark object on the left at sunrush sunset a seru in the city yuri and seru nepecities above and to the not to the left at sunset up there .,science
yeah up there .,science
yeah that there that is the side of that this is satums yellow moon and this satum on the hand side yeah and i love it .,science
it is drawing that is the shadow .,science
i do not normally see the moon that i i do not know yeah id have to have been there to call it but thats definitely and this of course and here another example of the red out of the sun .,science
tara said it is a street light thank you tara street light hi chris .,science
the street light. . hey guy these are pic from tara .,science
that look the red asteroid going in front of the sun .,science
you sent me pic too chris do you want to send me anything else ?,science
itll take me a while to find all that stuff .,science
he doe look that i got the one you sent me and well show those .,science
wow yeah no there is a there is a flourished to the left of the sun there the blue blip which could be lens flare nonlens flare .,science
yep exact same thing .,science
look at that .,science
why is it tarra ?,science
it is sarah. . and here is her picture her video of it we believe it is two sun .,science
i think this is her second or third capture now shes on a mission i am not sure if i am on a mission to i honestly thats a big i can not think of a better prospect for .,science
youd be yeah you got two location .,science
there are there are two lens flare there .,science
question is would it be that small or doe she have the blue asteroid yeah in the upper corner would our star be that small ?,science
wow would it be ?,science
look at that .,science
no it wouldnt be but if it is that close to view is it being outshined and how big is the actual star ?,science
because we are seeing this a very large flare and look at the size of that .,science
yeah and shes in texas and it is that big .,science
now the farther south you go the bigger the sun doe appear .,science
i learned that the first time i went to mexico and california .,science
sure it is a whole lot smaller up here in montana .,science
the upper look cut off too .,science
yeah yeah yeah that that blip that white blip is it is definitely there because it move along .,science
with it doesnt change with the series .,science
it is definitely there .,science
now question is is it the second sun being outshined ?,science
it is way small to be the second sun or is it the blue asteroid ?,science
because thats about the size for the asteroid .,science
let me blow it up another one here and see if there a facial to it .,science
i do not see a facial but yeah it is a little small to be the second star .,science
it could be because it could still be being outshined and we do not know how big this real star in the center a i said before .,science
now the actual star of what we are looking at here is because it could be a cut off enlarged flare a from or left or both .,science
it is very good that you caught that .,science
it is one of those two .,science
it is definitely not normal .,science
it is not one of our regular planet either .,science
it could be because there are four regular planet on the other side of the sun but i am not seeing that bright .,science
it is hard .,science
it is a few pic to chris .,science
we do not know if it is an asteroid or a sun .,science
is that what we are saying ? .,science
it is either a blue asteroid or it is the same but it is definitely a illuminated smaller object to the light of the sun .,science
it is not a ... yes .,science
i wanted to pull tara her video from last week .,science
she had a two sun video .,science
because it moved lip in the lens flare .,science
it tell u there are two object .,science
this wa a lens flare .,science
now that wa last week .,science
is this the same thing ?,science
it is in the same spot is not it ? .,science
i wonder ... something .,science
i can not imagine that soul would be farther away than it used to be .,science
we still have to have our holder placement but our system is not breaking up .,science
... thats what make all of this hard .,science
if you do not see it for yourself by yourself when you are standing outside and watching .,science
sometimes it is difficult to make a summation .,science
i think ... i do not know if ... sam are you having second thought maybe ?,science
no i am still ... this is why we havent completely called the second part .,science
they are separating .,science
we do not have ... we are up to six or seven example of it .,science
by the time we get to ten or twelve i will have a better definition of it .,science
because then well have more example .,science
and this is why ... look ... god we talked about the planet name from year two and a half to year three and a half .,science
we talked about the planet name for over a year .,science
before we even settled that yeah we are gon na call them that .,science
because i knew the name ahead of time .,science
but then we were calling all the purple planet or the striped planet .,science
the striped planet and the blue planet and the blue green planet .,science
and the red planet and the little green planet .,science
and they all matched and we went a year or longer knowing the name .,science
but never being able to attribute it without more proof .,science
and then once we saw purple planet had to come in and it matched everything else .,science
it wa god that we have to .,science
and we finally named the planet .,science
because we did not want to jump across that board thinking that we are all kink shit and everything .,science
and we knew what we were doing until we proved it .,science
and over a year of watching it and debating it with new member and old member .,science
and we finally we went with name weve never looked back since .,science
and they are active .,science
and they are from the pleiadian message .,science
it is not something we did not make up the name .,science
it wa a hand and me down from the internet going all the way back to two thousand and eight .,science
and it is stuck and i am not going to call him harrington and all the other crazy shit that other scientist attributed .,science
which wa a way for them to mask the whole thing in a fake name .,science
nobody would know what they were talking about .,science
by renaming the planet after themselves .,science
which i did not want to do and i did not want to be aerated .,science
and the moon sam .,science
let me see if this one it .,science
thats not it .,science
shes asking me if i have a. there another .,science
further back slide .,science
let me try to get .,science
thats telling u there two definitely two object there .,science
why is not the other lens flare bigger which is weird .,science
you can not do all the science and have all the answer but yeah there thats definitely an object illuminated above on the hand side .,science
which would be very strange .,science
and are we are we are we that confused are we forgotten the size of our son .,science
is that small .,science
and then the standard red .,science
is the standard red even bigger getting closer to u is it eighty million mile or seventy five million mile away from u . thats my fear .,science
because now if it is leaving .,science
why is it on the left hand side of our son .,science
because if it wa leaving it should be on the hand side of our son .,science
which cause me a level of concern .,science
we do not know where it is going to go .,science
there it is .,science
this is that same video but further back .,science
yeah there definitely an illuminated object to the upper .,science
because ive got it ive got on a large screen now .,science
keep watching this .,science
this is six or seven and we watch this .,science
and then again if they separate farther apart from each other then well get a better idea. . weve got to continue to watch whats going on and do you keep doing what you are doing .,science
you are doing a great job .,science
and yes it is hard to get this shit through cloud .,science
she said between eleven and one seems to be a prime time for this .,science
yeah thats because thats when you are going to have the highest arc and direct overheadness .,science
and i would look before dawn if the sun is going to come up and then you might see the smaller one first .,science
then then crack of dawn it go across the horizon depending on where you live if you have mountain in the way it take longer .,science
and the other one might come up first and then the smaller one by itself and then the larger sun come up and then that will of course over illuminate .,science
who know .,science
this is all part of the game where we got to keep watching and keep watching and keep watching and and compare our note and take more video and more capture .,science
and and yeah look at that .,science
that is very definitely illuminated .,science
and it is not asteroid illuminated .,science
it is bright .,science
and then we have not talked about the tool star. . there something we did not talk about in a long time. . yeah .,science
i do not hear about the tool star .,science
that wa back when i first started your grave .,science
that wa something that wa talked about often .,science
it wa this little blue dot wasnt it .,science
brighter than anything out there. . but yeah it always put off the intense shaft lighting .,science
is it a i can not remember is it a moon or a craft .,science
no it is not a mini it is a mini it is a mini being or or man made created star .,science
yeah it is a technology .,science
it is it is it is adhered the outer proximity of nibiru proper .,science
it is a technological star that wa created a a mini star and they use that stay connected to their star they do not go behind imaru and hit an ice age .,science
because they they control this is part of their technology they control their placement in the in the binary solar system with this mini tool star .,science
it is a direct miniature star thread connection to their star which keep them in more controlled proper placement .,science
beyond that i do not have the knowledge of that but thats what i know .,science
and i do not know how i know it .,science
i know it .,science
i know it .,science
i wonder how old it is you think there no way of telling i know but .,science
i i talk about when you start from the same thing on whats inside the ark of the covenant .,science
remember in some of the picture from the bible them opening a lid and there a big bright intensely large flare of light that come out of what if they put a mini star in there a little contained start micro cosmic star .,science
and that power alone would put off an air an aura of healing any number of power if you could focus in on that energy .,science
and ive often believed that inside the ark of the covenant wa a tiny mini star .,science
thats one of my little quirk you can you can laugh all you want but .,science
no it is nothing to laugh at i do not think .,science
ive always believed that there a micro mini star inside the ark of the covenant .,science
and i can not elaborate more on that .,science
that make sense because in raider of the lost ark when they opened the ark it wa bright the white this white light wa emitting from the ark and all these .,science
we are all part of the building block of the other dimension because people think of dimension a a mirror dimension but not a larger or smaller dimension .,science
and i believe thats we are the next dimension below u is smaller than we are in the microcosm ant man and all of that the subatomic and the and the next dimension above u is the astro atomic that we are the building block of .,science
and our soul is big .,science
it is a cell or a compound of metal or whatever soft metal group .,science
and we are we are part of a larger connected construction of larger universe in a larger dimension .,science
you can ponder astrophysics forever and there no way to come up with the proper answer unless you got some guide in in some scientific think tank going yeah look at the plaque on the wall .,science
thats mine .,science
i have a degree and i think this other than that thats there no answer for u to be able to prove any of this stuff .,science
and ive always pondered that dimension are micro medium and larger .,science
we are all connected .,science
no all that same set of rule .,science
all of those dimension are connected which is what hold everything together .,science
why it doesnt say which is why it is billion of year old and keep getting bigger .,science
and then their science is talking about we do not know why space is moving out .,science
it is moving .,science
we thought it wa static .,science
it ha to do with the one constant in this universe of perpetual motion .,science
the one and only constant is heat and cold exchange .,science
space is cold .,science
the big bang went boom .,science
that heat is going outward .,science
it is moving to the cold and the cold and the heat are turning place .,science
our solar system our universe is always expanding because that heat that energy will always continue outward .,science
and do our dimension because they are all connected .,science
physic according to sam or hoffman or whatever you want to it is all speculative .,science
i could go on and on about it but .,science
one hundred and forty .,science
i wa going to say they there this video where they took an iphone apple chip and they get this high powered microscope .,science
and they zoom in on it and it show all the intricate work and then they zoom in some more .,science
and it is one level after the next sam is saying with these dimension it is there one level then there another .,science
and if you watch this video it is crazy how it is it is this how did we make this thing and build it that ?,science
and there all these layer to it .,science
it is pretty neat .,science
yeah i love my site .,science
and watching computer generated .,science
if you sit and watch a fibronacci sequence you are looking at dimension .,science
it is the same and it get bigger and bigger or smaller and smaller which depends on which direction you are looking at the fibronacci sequence .,science
it is a repetitive connective pattern that no matter how deep you go in it is the same or how far you pull out it get the same .,science
and i love watching those .,science
and i havent seen any of them recently and i do need to drag up a couple of fibronacci sequence .,science
they are awesome .,science
and the sound study and the sand the sand sound harmonic study .,science
i love those too .,science
yeah yeah yeah awesome stuff .,science
awesome stuff .,science
and thats what the star and physic sound equal light equal matter .,science
and these pattern are formed from sound and then we could start talking about the humming of the planet and all the the trumpet sound from the plant when the when the planet first got here and all of that .,science
and we did not have any of that prior to that .,science
we did not have any crazy trumpet sound in two thousand and eight or two thousand and five or one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven .,science
none of that happened .,science
it happened when the secondary planet got here .,science
and thats when all these harmonic sound equal light equal matter .,science
all this crazy shit happened .,science
radioactive decay changed .,science
our light changed .,science
our earth tone are shoo our human resonance changed .,science
our star changed .,science
all our planet tipped .,science
everything changed .,science
and to ignore it is insane .,science
it is there are many thing that are all connected to look at this look at this .,science
it is pointing that way .,science
it is pointing that way .,science
it is pointing that way .,science
and i do not know how anybodys missing all of this and not putting it together .,science
it hurt my widow head .,science
it is it is an incredible responsibility you have to be the only person that ha this information .,science
i am sure my older brother is my biggest information weve ever seen .,science
i i do not see this a a responsibility .,science
i see it a an opinion. . it is my it is my duty to share my opinion. . i wa told that i would have an effect on some people .,science
not for the wrong reason but for the reason .,science
i do not do this to control people or to start a cult or anything that .,science
a cult is always the cult leader .,science
number one in my case you guy are number one in my opinion .,science
it is the it is the science and the member that matter .,science
and ive i have fried my as .,science
the picture you are looking at up in the upper hand corner here is a blonde samuel hoffman .,science
and i looked in the mirror the other day and there not much blonde going on anymore .,science
i have this year .,science
i even six month ago i wa very blonde still blonde .,science
i looked in the mirror the other day and went no .,science
what happened ?,science
when this when did this kick in ?,science
i turned gray haired recently .,science
you guy stop me to gray hair .,science
it is all your fault .,science
the same year i have my gray is all underneath the headphone .,science
here but my ear if i pull my hair back up it is very white .,science
i had myself from the side recently and then i got a picture of myself .,science
i wa the camera wa on and the computer wasnt running and i wasnt trying to post it .,science
and i looked over and wow my hair is gray .,science
and it is it is way curly on my shoulder now .,science
i am growing it back .,science
cut my hair because i knew i thought i had to go to court and i did not want to have long hair in front of the judge .,science
and then i did not need to go to court .,science
i know i got my hair for no reason .,science
disappointing but you do what you got to do. . here a few picture from christopher and he took today .,science
let wrap it up with that .,science
a few picture .,science
plus he on business with a multiple .,science
this wa after the first time i went outside .,science
i thought maybe above the building could be possibly a star destroyer or something .,science
what it looked .,science
that wa cool .,science
there a lot of there asteroid there .,science
there are several asteroid there .,science
look above the tower and the little the the antenna .,science
there a c upside or flat laying on his back c cloud and that is an asteroid .,science
and then there two or three behind it .,science
and remember we talked about this last week and the week before there a whole bunch of new asteroid that weve never documented because they were small before .,science
and now they are they are a chunk of manga man .,science
that is the site of your with the tan asteroid .,science
it is in your face there .,science
you can see him crossing sam draw .,science
it is cool .,science
tan asteroid and happy .,science
and then lorraine is the white up toward the upper there .,science
this is fappy is the middle bottom there .,science
and happy there .,science
thats in our bubble palm tree .,science
look at that .,science
we are under the happy .,science
leander named happy .,science
which one ?,science
it is a it is above the .,science
palm tree. . thats happy .,science
tan asteroid is over to the upper middle .,science
and those trail are .,science
i am going to make a comparison with that .,science
because it look the angle is perfect that slanted .,science
and it is always that to the left of our son .,science
i tell people when i am out live on tick tock we are always talking about left of our son salamander group .,science
i mentioned it all the time .,science
and it is i tell people it is always there left of our son coming in from a slant .,science
it would be repetitive if it wasnt something significant .,science
if you look on the hand side palm tree .,science
a little bit above it there .,science
there look this wavy line of gray black area to the and headed towards the middle of the picture .,science
that that blueish grayish wavy line with the white face .,science
thats the edge of yuri .,science
that wavy line is the definition between our stripe .,science
here again .,science
tan asteroid again over the left hand palm tree is happy and over to the top upper is lorraine .,science
and this is the bottom of at two at two moon .,science
the best .,science
and the red is coming in from over the palm tree to the left .,science
thats the red asteroid and dead center in the front is where the texas cube and all of that crap is .,science
if you look and see a cube sitting there with a bunch of other stuff around it .,science
this is the other side of the parking lot .,science
and once you get once you move twenty thirty foot everything change it is this is awesome .,science
and that dark blue area in the upper left the middle in this case and you can see the blue circle .,science
that is yuri and at two and at two moon all in the same way that bent rounded illumination come off .,science
going on there .,science
i am going to back it up a little bit because i saw something hang on .,science
yeah that look at the sun .,science
how it is curved that .,science
thats a cut off refraction .,science
there there the sun is there an object in the way .,science
terror read my mind .,science
there is a lot .,science
what is that what is that little square little white thing over the hand palm tree .,science
there a tiny little square there .,science
what ship is that .,science
that. . a little hook in the middle of the picture on the hand side .,science
there a little hook cloud going to a little square .,science
about two inch away from the palm tree .,science
the upper .,science
it look a craft .,science
thats weird .,science
you have earth .,science
i believe the human have a spacecraft with a i have a picture of it with a back deck on it that is made for space walking where you can walk off that back deck into space walk .,science
and i wa way fit that picture .,science
i do not even know where that picture is .,science
i have to look that up again .,science
between the light pole and the palm tree .,science
the bar .,science
between the light pole and the palm tree look square and very texas qb .,science
the light blue .,science
that light blue look in texas qb .,science
and then the dark blue above it is spin .,science
it is moon and out to yeah .,science
there a lot going on in this .,science
there a lot there is not it .,science
and then beside it to the left is asteroid .,science
it is you look up and it is a far a you can see .,science
you can see crap all the way a far a you can see looking upwards .,science
do between the palm tree and the light pole .,science
go back. . sorry .,science
back it up .,science
look at that circular cloud between the palm tree and the light pole .,science
a pair of eye and a nose .,science
and there your halloween .,science
the last stand and dead .,science
itll look at u . looking at u . between the light pole and the palm tree on the left .,science
on the left .,science
that one. . look at the cloud circle dead center between the palm tree and the light pole .,science
it is a skull asteroid .,science
when you change picture i saw it out of the corner of my eye because i looked over the microphone and then i brought my eye back and i went shit thats the skull staring at me .,science
look at that .,science
thats cool. . and here not what half an hour ago two hour ago i wa going what i want for halloween .,science
i want that big damn skull to be staring at me for halloween and there it is .,science
you definitely saw it when i wa out there .,science
you said thats a skull asteroid and i am i can not tell because it is much more bright i can not see anything .,science
this is from last week video .,science
you are much there .,science
yeah thats two sighting .,science
yeah thats a skull .,science
god can you imagine halloween night that sucker becoming illuminated at night over the little trick or treater .,science
using the red from the sathems refractive color a and a little bit of orange and stuff from seru and some purple and yeah look at it look it is on the left of the light pole there it is again .,science
thats the skull asteroid .,science
is it ?,science
what you are talking about is above the power line with the little line to one sideways .,science
all the way to the middle of the picture .,science
all the higher up .,science
i am looking down what is that thing because there an asteroid for sure above the power line because it is those little sideways line .,science
yeah but thats true .,science
i wondered it is what .,science
thats a trail thats eddie trail .,science
the asteroid itself proper .,science
they are circular and then you do not do not pay attention to the trail .,science
the big circular ball. . thats to the left of that light pole .,science
there a big circle there to the left of the light pole .,science
i see that too .,science
in that look for two eye and a nose because the front of it is masked by cloud .,science
go back to the other picture .,science
go back one picture .,science
it is way clearer on the other picture .,science
this one .,science
and a nose .,science
and a nose .,science
and a nose. . look carefully .,science
look at that .,science
thats crazy how close that is .,science
now do you have a copy of the real nasa release footage for all of u ?,science
i have them to get it .,science
i know where my copy is .,science
i want to call asteroid but if you have it go ahead .,science
and of course it is in the monthly site grind too .,science
and it is also it is where i drew it this month on the monthly site grind also .,science
except it is bigger than i do .,science
happy halloween .,science
there once it .,science
in time for halloween .,science
i do not know how many time i thought i saw the skull asteroid in my photo and it is never it is never it ever .,science
it is tricky .,science
because it is hiding between at you and yuri .,science
that wasnt the yeah .,science
there it .,science
there is on your drawing .,science
now let get the nasa one here .,science
and remember the mouth is not that predominantly visible .,science
and in the picture on the there is an object in front of the jaw .,science
and that wa the lead object back year ago .,science
thats why it is black .,science
but it is fully there .,science
but you can not see it because there another object in front of it thats shadowing it .,science
but the left picture is the nasa released footage .,science
the picture is also nasa released footage .,science
and the left eye is bigger than the eye .,science
wow. . and then the picture on now the picture on the left is facing the opposite director because that is where it wa visible in two thousand and eighteen when yuri and attu were on the hand side which is why the illumination is coming from the left .,science
the picture on the is from two thousand and nineteen two thousand and twenty when attu and yuri were visibly overhead and in front of u . and this is when you could see in between them .,science
and of course youve got dozen and dozen of more capture of them .,science
this one is good .,science
that is scary .,science
and this is how i saw it creep out of the light the first time i saw it by eye in two thousand and fifteen .,science
and it came out .,science
you got teeth. . and the wispy cloud make those teeth .,science
in the nasa release is probably doctored to le scary .,science
they probably doctored it down .,science
look at that .,science
i havent seen that yet .,science
is it carved or is it not carved ?,science
and did somebody carve that asteroid to look that to scare the crap out of the earth for a thousand year or whatever. . whats the story behind that ?,science
id love to know .,science
the story of the asteroid because it is hot .,science
we talked about it for four year before nasa announced it .,science
and then i chuckled god that day .,science
they said yeah there is an asteroid .,science
and then they gave the wrong orbit placement and the wrong frequency of return orbit .,science
and i laughed .,science
caught them in another lie .,science
and they said it come by every three and a half year in earth orbit natural going around dinner plate scenario .,science
when we knew better because we knew that it wa not in a earth orbit pattern earth and our normal planet because we knew it wa hiding between yuri and atu in the other solar system that they can not even mention .,science
but the funny thing is this is the only object that they have mentioned out of the niver system .,science
yeah thats weird .,science
it is the only one .,science
and i thought of that for the first time now .,science
yeah there you go .,science
and there a whole shitload of stuff in behind it .,science
and if you notice i drew a tiny little cube in there a . yeah .,science
for the of it .,science
the skull is a tiny little cube .,science
it should be bigger but i drew it in a a hint rather than if you look .,science
there a tiny little cube to the of the skull .,science
yeah look at that .,science
of course it match .,science
i do not i often i do not think about it .,science
and it is ... yeah let see .,science
shes asking and the mini moon is that something that wa named already by you sam ?,science
thats micro stuff compared to what weve been watching .,science
if we tried to if we tried to catalog everything up there we would be wed be insane and then wed be confusing everybody .,science
now the picture on the here is one of the oldest sighting of the skull asteroid .,science
and this wa when it wa horizontal off the horizon .,science
god i am gon na say two thousand and sixteenish seventeenish .,science
i do not remember the year i think the year on the left hand picture because of the light angle would have to be two thousand and seventeentwo thousand and eighteen .,science
but the oldest one is the one on the .,science
and that wa when we knew we had a bunch that week that first week that we saw .,science
we started seeing this this came from europe i believe .,science
it is got ta be it is got ta be three asteroid .,science
nah it can not be it can not be a skull .,science
and then we started getting closeup of it for a couple of month .,science
and then we did not even dare talk about it .,science
and then it became prominent .,science
and that we and then i saw it by eye about two thousand and fifteen .,science
and after that being that i knew that i saw it creep around the backside of attu in between yuri .,science
and i knew where the placement wa in my own mind .,science
and i went it is real .,science
for the longest time this is back when you were first starting out rebecca .,science
and we had a lot of religious folk in some of the early montana sky watcher one two etc .,science
and over the year we still have them but theyve grown their religion and grown some science too .,science
it is it is been a long process to get here .,science
but love every second of it .,science
yeah that one is particularly gruesome .,science
and i believe it is back in the and ill notice where the light coming from from the left again .,science
this ha got to be two thousand and seventeen two thousand and eighteen when yuri wa on the hand side of the sun .,science
a sarah wa backing away and nibiru wa backing away and then we got to deal with yuri .,science
yeah thats .,science
that is weird .,science
and the funny thing is gray alien do have eye about that big .,science
most everybody improperly draw them .,science
they make their eye too big or too small .,science
and i have seen my share of them .,science
and theyve got hauntingly scary big black eye .,science
and you do not know if they are directly looking at you or not because there no real pupil .,science
they are creepy .,science
they can be nice if they want to be .,science
and thats why i always say we know about the gray .,science
they need to be superbites .,science
they look at u animal but i would think i am not the nervous looking at them they are an animal .,science
they are jealous and they are mad at u that we are destroying our world and how we could dare to be our penance way we do when they lost their .,science
they are .,science
they are recovering recovering lost race .,science
and they work for the higher race to do because they can atmospherically handle different atmosphere .,science
they are the worker .,science
when somebody come from another planet they can not function in our atmosphere .,science
but these guy can .,science
i do not think you ... yeah thats completely weird .,science
i think thats an overdramatization of reality. . i do not know .,science
i think it is wrapping in a bind .,science
somebody went nut on .,science
when it come to gray i do not think anybody give that information out about gray and they have smart one and dumb one and they i talk about the great big traveling fact velociraptor or cat or wolf .,science
they travel in group .,science
and the old saying is if a gray or two in the wood in front of you do not shoot at them because there seven behind you velociraptor or wolf .,science
yeah you got a lot in there .,science
this shot alone is insane .,science
the amount of object i am seeing here .,science
there a bunch of little square there .,science
maybe there some new ship we havent seen before .,science
i wa going to ask that .,science
it is entirely possible .,science
they are long they are square they are smaller .,science
they are different than anything weve seen .,science
it is entirely possible another faction got here .,science
because those are irregular .,science
they are absolutely irregular and they look crap to me .,science
ive been staring at picture for fourteen year .,science
if not me qualified to call it then who ?,science
yeah behind the palm tree on the left is where the skull asteroid is .,science
thats what that .,science
behind it is the skull .,science
and the spiral asteroid is over to the left above the two palm tree on the left .,science
do the spiral ?,science
yeah i see that .,science
or it is or it is pappy .,science
i have to take it back .,science
it is not spiral .,science
the spiral should be lower off to the and closer .,science
and the lead object also stand out now that dark spot to the upper .,science
yeah darker than the ground in the size is .,science
and also there should be the long box cube should be on the in that blue a and darker .,science
and maybe thats about the palm tree in the .,science
the smaller one .,science
he going to go to bed .,science
it is four a.m. for him .,science
thank you for the last show long .,science
happy halloween in case you do not see you ahead of time .,science
i am glad that you are going our show and it is all david been around forever .,science
thank you for your excellent membership .,science
and we love you dearly .,science
you can not say you next week too .,science
i know that me too .,science
i joined the club .,science
you do not want to hear me sing .,science
man it is rough .,science
it is uncomfortable .,science
it hurt to try to sing now since ive had the surgery .,science
and i worry about it .,science
i worry about it because i am supposed to go in for more and i do not want more because i need my voice .,science
and i do not need any more cutting on me .,science
i do not surgery at all .,science
i feel a little twinge from time to time and i am not uncomfortable and i am not in pain and i am swallowing .,science
for the last time that lump got big fast it wa spooky .,science
i had a walnut underneath my larynx and i couldnt swallow anything anymore i finally went in .,science
they went when were you exposed to great deal of radiation ?,science
not if but when .,science
and i believe it wa spookishima .,science
i know i remember the day that i got rained on .,science
were you exposed to that much radiation ?,science
i remember the day that i wa out in that rainstorm .,science
it wa a freak rainstorm .,science
i went out chasing my lawn furniture .,science
i wa out in the rain for probably three maybe four minute .,science
chasing down the table in the chair and bringing them back to the yard and stacking them they wouldnt blow away again in an eddy wind free area .,science
and then i came back in the house and i wa on within about two and a half to five minute i wa on fire .,science
everywhere that the rain wa on my face the top of my head my shoulder my elbow my knee my back .,science
everywhere i wa bending over that the rain wa on me .,science
especially my cheek where the glass where my glass dropped the water under my facial cheek area .,science
and then i wa burning and i thought acid rain .,science
it wa notably burning .,science
and i went and immediately took a shower and scrubbed that area and it wa painful to even touch those area .,science
and for about five year i had trouble even washing my hair .,science
because the top of my head hurt bad and my top of my shoulder .,science
and then i got sick for a very long time .,science
i could barely do anything .,science
i am trying to raise the kid at the same time and that wa two thousand and eleven .,science
and then five year later i had that surgery .,science
and it wa of course exterior cancer .,science
it wasnt interior thyroid cancer which is natural cancer .,science
mine wa exterior .,science
i got exposed to radiation .,science
and they told me that directly .,science
what blow me and i asked the doctor i said what did you report that to the cdc and she said no we do not report that .,science
it is shouldnt you ?,science
and this is going on in canada and oregon coast or washington state or california now if you go to the beach and you are listening and you go swimming at the beach stay the hell away from black sand .,science
the area if you are a beach goer what black sand is .,science
stay away from it .,science
it is toxic .,science
it is radioactive .,science
the noaa national oceanic aeronautical administration .,science
year ago and they only did it once they warned everybody absolutely to not eat any fish out of the entire pacific ocean .,science
because it is radioactive with bucushima waste which is cesium two hundred and fourteen .,science
i do not know and the russian do that to spy all the time .,science
they bring isotope into people proximity where they get sick and could die .,science
and i got ill for a very long time and i did not tell anybody .,science
i tried to struggle through it until i had the surgery and then when i wa told what i wa told then i wanted to share that information with you guy .,science
i think it is still a crime that they are still dumping that radioactive degraded water .,science
now it is not a toxic a it used to be but it is still toxic and they are dumping it in the ocean every day .,science
and they will be for year to come .,science
every day one .,science
the day that happened every damn major country on this planet should have been flying bomber airplane bomber drop of cement on top of it from every country on this planet .,science
thats what i do not get .,science
you should build a cement mountain out of that .,science
and then underneath it and then cemented underneath it .,science
and they are not and it is still it went china syndrome .,science
they do the reactors. . they tried building this ice they bury these pipe around the reactor vessel into the ground .,science
i do not know how far deep but it is the water the groundwater is coming off the mountain .,science
to the ocean and it go it is going through the reactor .,science
and they put these pipe in .,science
they ran water through the pipe and they tried to freeze the ground in an effort to stop the groundwater .,science
they have to build a sarcophagus over the top of it and underneath of it .,science
and they havent done it yet .,science
what are they what are they doing .,science
why are not other country saying this is .,science
why are not we doing something about it .,science
we are doing something about it .,science
i think every country on the planet .,science
i do not know why .,science
day one they should have been dropping bomber load repetitive bomber load of cement over the top of that within within ten hour .,science
it should have been nonstop until that thing wa buried in eighty foot of cement .,science
and then when that dry you dig underneath it and then you do a third here a third here a fifth or a sixth of it in this edge and you you bury that and then you add .,science
and yeah great people or machine going down there would be exposed .,science
and thats the thing .,science
there we do not even know how many people are going to die from from fukushima including their resident .,science
but if you look at chernobyl and stuff that there some weird shit going on with chernobyl where the wolf are doing fine .,science
a a matter of fact they are getting quite big .,science
there are there are some noticeable genetic alteration going in some of the animal in that area .,science
it is also not nearly a radioactive a it used to be which is odd .,science
of course who science do you trust .,science
and the same thing with fukushima already there people already wandering back into the fukushima prefecture .,science
and they are not getting two hundred and fifty rad they are getting one hundred rad or seventy five and leaf wa one hundred and twenty five depending on which series of science you study .,science
but if you go to the beach on california or in oregon and you walk up with to the black sand with a geiger counter youll read one hundred and twenty eight one hundred and forty which is lethal dose .,science
if you were to let your kid play in that for an hour your kid would die within a couple of year .,science
our sea our ocean life wa poor poor animal that are eating all our plastic bag thinking they are squid whale etc .,science
and when they decay they put off a toxic radioactive decay and those toxin that radioactive degradation of a synthetic it is inside of u or anything else it is not healthy .,science
now if it wa a natural decay then it would be naturally absorbed by the human body .,science
this is not this is a synthetic and it ha it ha consequence and we should never have gone a crazy a we did with plastic .,science
it is in everything and now we are making all these crazy plastic and if you have a bottle or a piece of plastic that break in your hand after about six month .,science
radioactive that is or how alteringly toxic the degradation of that plastic is for it to break down that .,science
it is pretty and do not god do not keep bottled water in your car .,science
if you do and you are adding instant toxic pcbs to your water and you are drinking it .,science
it is almost gun to your head stupid do not keep i do not even buy that shit .,science
all water come in plastic though .,science
i know not keeping it in your car where it is hot and for a long time .,science
we do not know where it wa stored before we bought it in store .,science
there an average of time i think it is it is some water can take up to six month to get from the where they package it to the store .,science
. . and then how long have you done that .,science
and then read the label where wa it stored .,science
how hot wa it .,science
what they say .,science
they say this is recycled water which mean it is full of antibiotic and antidepressant and hormone and god only know because they do not filter that shit out at the at the at the sanitation company .,science
they do not microscopically filter that .,science
no they sell water that came out of a came out of a water treatment plant in houston texas and then they added fresh water .,science
and then while my phone wa doing .,science
. . and that all go into groundwater .,science
i think there is a glass . . yeah .,science
i am a gallon jug a far a safer than those plastic bottle .,science
now the big five gallon the blue plastic they do not break down .,science
if you got a plastic milk jug for about for milk will last about two to two and a half year .,science
those those bottle water bottle theyll last a year .,science
and then they break and you squeeze them and then they shatter .,science
that show you the breakdown of how fast there is decay and pcbs going into that water .,science
enough about that .,science
i do that too .,science
put a little sprinkle in your water .,science
it ha some .,science
borax is a quality .,science
borax wa removed from laundry far .,science
because that used back in the 70 . thats what used to cause all the bubbly foam on our our pond and stream because the water would go into the end and would bubble and and and then youd see all of this buzz .,science
but if you have borax and you throw it into your laundry soap your laundry soap is going to clean away way better .,science
but i do not recommend using great deal amount of use a couple tablespoon .,science
do not throw a whole cup in there .,science
a couple of tablespoon of borax .,science
that way you are being environmentally friendly .,science
you borax is used in the separation of gold .,science
a a matter of fact .,science
anybody who want to look out of process and make and learn about gold look up one of my favorite youtubers .,science
i watched most mount baker .,science
which is mount baker in washington state .,science
and i watch a lot of his video .,science
i watched him from a younger guy and he getting gray on his chin now .,science
thats how long ive been watching him .,science
i hope you listen to our show .,science
and he ha his own gold mine .,science
lock mine and then he also break it down how he process it .,science
now he separate the copper and there a whole bunch of cool chemistry and alchemy going on there .,science
he teach all kind of stuff .,science
if you want to learn how to make gold out of the side of a mountain into a little bar .,science
hell show you all of that .,science
and there a whole bunch of people that do that dan hurd prospecting .,science
it is another one that i to watch .,science
and he doe real good .,science
he hilarious .,science
he from canada .,science
he a sketch one guy or maybe anyway .,science
he could be elsewhere but i think he up there .,science
i know he up in western canada .,science
and then there all kind of other one .,science
i still watching the coast town living .,science
thats another good one .,science
thats a guy who run a body silver mine in southern california outside of los angeles .,science
in case you want to watch those .,science
and those three guy have all gotten together .,science
i think all three of them have .,science
i know that mount baker mining and metal ha gone through sarah gordo and i know that he also gone over with dan hurd .,science
they all know each other .,science
it is a cool little youtube environment and how to process and learn about gold .,science
which is also part of what we are talking about here .,science
and the fact that we earthling are on this soft metal planet mining commodity for the higher race that own u that nobody want to hear .,science
that are here now parked over our head and going you puny little human give u our stuff .,science
tribute of the god whether you it or not .,science
no wonder the queen died .,science
she did not want to give up all her treasure .,science
you imagine the mountain of gold that those people have .,science
now i bet they have to part with some of it .,science
where do they keep it all ?,science
you do not think bucking in my palace is all ballroom and bathroom is it .,science
those city have been there for seven hundred to eight hundred a year .,science
rome for instance three hundred to two hundred ad and then prior to that wa even other kink ship and all .,science
i can not even imagine amassing that amount of gold .,science
anyway it would turn you crazy to try and protect all of that shit .,science
id rather be poor .,science
more money more problem .,science
doesnt it get to a certain point where you do not need anymore .,science
yeah but you do not dare leave home because somebody might sneak in and steal it while you are away .,science
the crown jewel for god sake .,science
can you imagine even owning the crown jewel that you couldnt wear them often enough to make it worthwhile .,science
the star of rhodesia or the the great pearl of death and all these other thing that are embedded in crown and all this crap that people died over diamond the size of a golf ball .,science
and all of that ha been sequestered by king and we the peasant who have been you served into servitude through comfort we are now we are a bunch of sissy .,science
i could you imagine your average joe facebook trying to survive in montana in a snowstorm .,science
i can not imagine trying to survive in a snowstorm .,science
i get ive slept in snow cave before with a teabag and the raw rabbit sandwich .,science
i did one time eat raw rabbit .,science
it is not fun .,science
it wa partially cooked but yeah it is chewing rubber .,science
if you are if you are cold enough and you are hungry and you are .,science
yeah because you are hungry and you got nothing else .,science
thats what you eat .,science
my i guess squirrel and all the gamey or maid have lower phosphorus in it and when my wife had my wife ha a kidney transplant when you go into kidney failure you can not eat you can not have any food with phosphorus in it .,science
it cause a problem with your thyroid and then it is a whole cascade of problem they put in the hospital menu for her .,science
i am are they making this in the hospital cafeteria .,science
why would that be on the hospital menu thats always been pretty funny .,science
hey now whats wrong with a little hausen pepper .,science
thats german for rabbit by the way .,science
even having that on their menu .,science
wheres my hausen pepper .,science
you can learn these thing back when cartoon you teach you things. . did you did you watch those beekmans world video that i posted .,science
did you enjoy them .,science
yeah they are good .,science
i the penguin .,science
they are funny .,science
yeah i told you we should have listened to montana skywatchers .,science
i forgot their name but they are pretty funny .,science
yeah they are .,science
the tv catch on fire and they are funny .,science
yeah why do not we see the rerun of that .,science
come on man ill watch the beekmans world rerun and enjoy every second of it .,science
way better than bill nye the science guy .,science
do not tell him that .,science
bill will probably get mad at me if he heard me .,science
i definitely did enjoy beekmans world very much .,science
and they teach you science. . he doe teach some very good .,science
although he talking about rabbit part and god only know what or rat part or .,science
by the way ive often thought one of the top if we wanted to run a youtube program where we could get a lot of view .,science
we should run one called fun with fart .,science
and then everybody submit their daily fart photo from around member around the world .,science
thats you got ta do weird radical stuff to get view .,science
we could have a generation of people tick talking picture of the back side a they let out the ripper of the day. . yeah .,science
i see your point though .,science
thats where we are at .,science
that would probably be a hit .,science
probably. . and to this day my favorite bud light commercial .,science
every time i think it is about that time we are going to have it out again this season .,science
it is the bud light commercial with the slay ride. . and the guy take this girl out on a slay ride and shes sitting there and they are in a nice winter land after dark moon shining star are out .,science
shes holding this candle in front of her .,science
they are dressed in all these nice beautiful wintery clothes and he go now for the real surprise .,science
he bend over to grab out these two bud light .,science
meanwhile shes holding this candle .,science
light lane it .,science
the horse lift up his tail and rip off a fart and ignites this woman on fire and her hair is standing up and all singed in pride .,science
he come up the bud light and he go whoa .,science
then it is still to this day my favorite bud light commercial is the slay ride and it is no matter how many time i watch it i still have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a hoot .,science
i still break up and complete laughter .,science
ive watched it a hundred time and bud light at slay ride it is a commercial you can look it up .,science
and my other favorite is rocketman the fart scene out of the movie rocketman and commander i do not feel good and they are joined their spacesuit because they have a malfunction .,science
black i am talking about gibberish by now and we are we are talking about spinning circle .,science
can you hear me ?,science
no you couldnt hear me .,science
i wa in the kitchen .,science
love it when you all run long .,science
but can understand yall get tired .,science
it is because i start at eight thirty this morning .,science
i wake up and when you wake up to the time the show start go real quick ?,science
yeah ive been sitting in my show .,science
it is almost twelve hour .,science
my show start at eight thirty .,science
yeah. . but i wa going to say our longest show wa ten hour and eight minute .,science
it wa six month ago .,science
i think that wa the one .,science
i think nicole wa on that show .,science
i am pretty sure that wa the show that she wa with u on .,science
and some of our newer viewer are probably going to be crazy .,science
after that it wa nine hour and fifty one minutes. . and then nine nineteen nine zero three nine zero one .,science
those are the top five .,science
yeah i we are at top .,science
we are at number six .,science
yeah let get to number seven .,science
yeah let get somewhere around nine hour .,science
we can we got three and a half minute and yeah i am i am i am feeling warm and sweaty and i do not think the house is warm .,science
ive me been sitting in this chair too long .,science
it feel good to walk around .,science
we torture ourselves .,science
and i ive digressed off the topic five time .,science
and the crazy ramblings of sam said i am shut up and i i chuckle every time i bring that back up i do not know my my leg hurt from walking all day .,science
the thing we put our body through to get this information out .,science
i know i know i know i take advantage over time together well play all week for this moment. . yeah i do walking up the hill though it give you a better it give me a better vantage point of everything .,science
and it is when i when i look up the street and realize i got to walk uphill it is not i turn the other way and walk down the block to the church parking lot .,science
i finally did it today. . i need to get one of those electric bike that jillian ha or something .,science
. . thatd be handy. . to get the information out there real quick .,science
but the view is perfect .,science
is it a full three hundred and sixty view or is it the west ?,science
it is that there .,science
from the southeast all the way to the northeast and then that mountain is behind me. . yeah you can pretty much get everything .,science
nate thats cool .,science
i want to get the view .,science
i do not know if you can hear me .,science
all the way up against the mountain .,science
thats the edge town .,science
. . and then the mountain and thats it .,science
i am giving connection warnings. . chris can you hear me ?,science
can you hear me ? .,science
i am getting having trouble connecting issue .,science
remember that last time they they booted me off the show when we started talking about it four minute early .,science
i am i am having connection trouble .,science
ill stay a long a they let me but i figured id let .,science
ive got the big x screen in front of me here saying having trouble connecting this often can be caused by unstable internet connection .,science
my wifi is try plugging it into your router .,science
yeah. . i know .,science
i am having wifi issue and it is still up .,science
i do not see rebecca at all and shes gone .,science
maybe they got her booted too .,science
we are going you guy are you guy are boring .,science
we are we are going to boot you .,science
thank you michelle .,science
i can see in here everybody .,science
thats loud .,science
i am i am unfortunately too close to my microphone .,science
especially when i get concerned that ive got bumped off again and i wa thinking they are going to boot me at the end of the show again they did a couple of show ago .,science
anyway i can not see the clock because ive got the trouble .,science
they are messing with u . thats .,science
it is it is free knowing that they are potentially doing i i do not want to believe that there this is we definitely have to be the big they they are messing they are messing with u too .,science
and every time i hear somebody say that i always i always have to go who who is they .,science
it is not here but it is also on tiktok a . it is the same standard argument about somebody i am not going to go into sovereign citizenship again but i do not know .,science
i watch a bunch of that stuff on tv and shes my god .,science
somebody told you that there this private account with a billion dollar in your name and because somebody told and they are going to laugh you out of there .,science
and god it is scary what people do not know .,science
and anyway yeah you guy got to find out about these crazy as passing planet that nobody know about that are here for a decade now .,science
and this is of course why i wa bringing up beekmans world because i have that one picture that say duh never ha been here for over ten year .,science
and it it amazes me that weve been watching this damn group of planet in the second star for going on fourteen fifteen year now and it is still not mainstream .,science
youve got to be kidding me .,science
and then we are seeing brand new spacecraft weve never seen before .,science
yeah yeah god those picture chris they are i am pretty sure you got some unusual new spacecraft in that shot .,science
we can investigate that and keep our eye open .,science
and i will try to find that one picture .,science
i did not see much when i wa outside .,science
i am excited to look at the picture .,science
yeah there wa a nasa release where they off the space station they released a picture of a ship .,science
and it went viral immediately .,science
and of course nobody ha and i saved a copy of it .,science
but there a ship with a back deck a platform you were on a boat .,science
and to me it it screamed that this is for space walk .,science
this is a deck that you can take your space suit and and then leap off that thing and leap back on to it according to these suit .,science
and they do not have to be tethered anymore because they got they have independent jet suit and stuff now .,science
and i am sure their suit are far better .,science
they have eleven layer and the damn thing weigh eighty pound .,science
i wa watching a thing on spacesuit the other day .,science
you can tell i do some crazy homework sometimes .,science
and look weve lost rebecca altogether .,science
maybe shes having the same .,science
i still have the trouble warning up .,science
it hasnt dropped .,science
and i shouldnt be able to talk but i apparently can .,science
try using chrome if this continues .,science
yeah i wa and i do not use chrome .,science
i use msn and bing .,science
and that could be that could be part of maybe thats why i can not use camera and microphone at the same time .,science
because i am not running off a chrome .,science
chrome is more of a laptop than pc .,science
and it is an average use in laptop use .,science
and if i would go to chrome it would be a pain in the butt to switch everything over .,science
i spent a couple of week trying to reget my link back together .,science
i already had enough trouble trying to get every day done let alone nerd .,science
and i am terrible about learning new computer crap .,science
window eight worked great .,science
now i am at window eleven and i am not happy with it .,science
it is more laid out for phone .,science
and it doesnt do it doe not serve a computer pc .,science
it may work on laptop i do not know .,science
but for the pc window eleven is far le usable .,science
window eight wa great .,science
you could do all kind of thing .,science
and window ten is god do i have to do it again ?,science
and window eleven it came mandatory and everything they were putting out in hp is shit i get no choice .,science
i can not buy a computer with window eight .,science
i can only buy a computer with window eleven .,science
and i am on my 15th computer .,science
yeah fifteen year fourteen year .,science
some year one year i replaced three computer .,science
one year .,science
because i bought two cheap one and one good one .,science
and then the next year and the next one went out and then another year or two of them went out .,science
i am i am way ahead on the curve .,science
and when you when you buy a cheap computer they are only going to last two year if you are lucky .,science
this is why i always recommend hp .,science
because hp last three to five year .,science
and i had my tech guy come in and he say yeah all your computer are only going to last three year .,science
i went christ what am i paying this money for ?,science
and i guess everybody else ha money and i do not .,science
them it is no biggie .,science
i am amazed that i am still here because the connection signal having trouble connecting is still up .,science
it ha not gone down .,science
i wonder if i shut facebook down and the tab .,science
msm tab window closed that down .,science
maybe itll clear up .,science
anyway i god i closed facebook and i should type to rebecca to see what shes up to. . she she wow he see me .,science
i want to .,science
she might be having trouble that i did .,science
this is weird .,science
. . i am on facebook .,science
it opened .,science
no it is not chat are not opening .,science
i am i am having bad internet service. . there it is .,science
i see all of you .,science
it is you .,science
i only i only see you and me .,science
shes not there on. . i sent the .,science

she sent me a screenshot and big flare in the middle of it and yeah all three of u . and i do not see rebecca on my stream yard at all .,science
anyway since me fine and we are at the end of the show and weve gone i can not even see the clock anymore because this this symbol is in front of it .,science
this is the fourth on the show .,science

welcome to tumble the show where we explore story of science discovery .,science
today in time for halloween weve got an episode all about cat .,science
ooh a spooky episode about halloween cat .,science
i do not know how spooooooky it is but it is about how we might have gotten cat all wrong .,science
and how science can help u understand our furry feline friend .,science
marshall you might remember that our last halloween episode wa about cat .,science
the mind control cat parasite ?,science
thats more about the parasite a toxoplasma gondii than the cat .,science
that it life inside ?,science
yes that one .,science
thats true .,science
but in the course of doing the episode we said something about cat that got a lot of attention from our listener who left review about it .,science
and i thought we could take this halloween episode to make amends .,science
marshall what i want you to do is channel all of your feeling about cat being evil .,science
yeah we got a lot of listener review about that because for some reason they think that cat are not evil .,science
you are digging a hole here marshall .,science
hopefully by the end of this episode well change your mind .,science
i want to set the record straight .,science
i enlisted the help of a cat scientist who can tell u why we got cat wrong and why they are not evil .,science
i think cat are amazing .,science
i asked michael whether she think cat deserve their evil halloweeny spooky reputation .,science
no i do not think cat are spooky .,science
to me i think people find cat maybe mysterious or hard to read .,science
i do not think that necessarily equates with spooky but obviously some people are afraid of cat .,science
i do not know why .,science
again i think that ha more to do with the human side of thing than the cat side of thing .,science
the problem is not cat it is me .,science
it is specifically me .,science
it is me hi i am the problem .,science
it is me and other human .,science
i think noted cat lover taylor swift would definitely agree with you .,science
is that what that song is about ?,science
i wanted to start by coming clean with michael about the reputation that weve gained from this .,science
here what happened when i read her a few of our many pro cat listener review .,science
i want to read for you a couple of the review that we got from actual kid .,science
they are the best .,science
did i write that email ?,science
i am sad that you think cat are evil and they are going to hurt you .,science
i have a cat named morning and shes nice and it hurt me .,science
please reconsider cat period are period not period evil exclamation point .,science
i do feel minorly conflicted that we hurt some of our listener feeling but cat can still be lovable despite being evil .,science
those thing are not connected .,science
you are going deeper on this .,science
the point is to apologize marshall .,science
they are small and they are cute and they are farina lovable and they are also evil. . i need to say this for you that you are allergic to cat and this is where your feeling come from .,science
i do not know if youve unearthed this in therapy yet but i am diagnosing you .,science
i should also say there is a pro mouse contingent out there that ha strong feeling on the subject .,science
a lot of people are allergic to cat .,science
a lot of people love mouse and bird but those thing do not need to stop u from being curious enough to learn the science behind our relationship with cat .,science
and thats what michael is here to teach u . michael study cat behavior and shes published two paper about way that we misunderstand cat called catastrophic myth .,science
and misconception about cat part one and two .,science
i love a scientist who punds .,science
in her paper michael writes that behavior that we may see a sign of evilness or meanness are cat responding to what their human are doing .,science
maybe i am the one who mean .,science
is that what we are saying here ?,science
it sound we might need a little help understanding what cat need .,science
but why are cat mysterious about it ?,science
because with dog you always know how they feel and also some of them can talk .,science
whats the deal with cat ?,science
some of them can .,science
i think the problem is you do not understand animal at all .,science
because a dog ha never talked to you. . michael told me that part of our problem in understanding cat is how we are always comparing them to dog .,science
we do not talk about why are cat different from hamster ?,science
but it is always why are cat different from dog ?,science
we expect them to be the same because they are both very popular and they are very different specie .,science
shes saying that because we put dog and cat in the same thats a pet we have category doesnt mean that we should compare them a better or worse than the other .,science
it is comparing apple to orange but why would we compare apple and orange ?,science
we eat them both a lot but they are different .,science
the question of why cat and dog are different ha to do with how they came to live with u in our home or scientifically speaking how they were domesticated .,science
in other word weve bred dog for thousand of year to have specific trait that are useful for u . we bred some dog be hunting dog or guard dog or my favorite dog the kind that sits in your lap .,science
and michael told me that dog have been domesticated for much longer than cat thousand of year longer .,science
weve had time to develop these trait and dog that make u relate to them .,science
but even their facial feature that might make them look a little more human to u ?,science
their ability to smile their ability to raise their eyebrow .,science
these are thing that we do not see in cat .,science
weve bred dog that they smile and raise their eyebrow we did that on purpose .,science
i do not know about specifically breeding for a cute little eyebrow raise .,science
but it is something that make them feel a little bit more human our best friend .,science
and a cute a cat are there still something a little wild in their face .,science
a a result people look at a cat and they do not see a human looking back at them necessarily .,science
they do not see a smile .,science
they do not see a frown or a raised eyebrow .,science
we see a blank slate and then we start trying to fill in that blank .,science
when i think a cat is staring at me because it is wondering if it is big enough to kill me and eat me thats probably not true .,science
it is definitely not doing that .,science
instead of assuming that the cat is relaxed and enjoying looking out the window or is happy that we are there .,science
no people go to i think the cat mad at me or i think the cat think i am a jerk or or or .,science
michael is saying that cat are not plotting against u or secretly scheming to take over the world .,science
and youll know it if they were .,science
if these thing were possible cat would definitely have taken over the world by now .,science
honestly based on looking at cat behavior how do we know that they havent already taken over the world ?,science
everything thats meaningful to them ha already been conquered .,science
they stay inside all day .,science
they get all the food that they want by asking for it and they sleep twenty two hour a day .,science
that sound someone who running the world .,science
indeed. . now that weve learned i think why cat are misunderstood the science is also showing that cat do care about their human .,science
there been a lot of research looking at do cat miss you when you are gone ?,science
the answer is yes .,science
do they recognize when we are concerned or upset ?,science
and the answer is yes .,science
hold on .,science
i thought michael said that we can not even read cat expression .,science
are there study that tell u what go on in those itty bitty kitty brain ?,science
and more importantly science can tell u how to make our cat ruler happy .,science
well get into all the cat science after we press pause to take a quick break .,science
we are back and it is time to find out how science get inside the convoluted mind of cat .,science
i do not even think it wa possible to get a cat to stop sitting on you or to get them to the vet .,science
how on earth did people get cat to participate in a study ?,science
michael say that science come to the cat .,science
of course it doe .,science
cat do not do that in a sterile unfamiliar environment .,science
it is very hard to study their behavior in a laboratory .,science
yeah sound world ruler behavior to me again .,science
yes your majesty .,science
we brought our humble science to your regal abode .,science
please will you help u ?,science
please descend off your cat condo and let u lay these gift at your foot .,science
of course .,science
but i do not know are they barging into the cat house with a bunch of test tube ?,science
i feel thats not going to go for the scientist .,science
the experiment michael told me are about determining cat preference or cat preference .,science
all this is getting started is not it ?,science
the first half wa a warm up .,science
how do they study cat preference ?,science
thanks marshall .,science
the scientist start with a question about what cat because understanding what cat can it help people have more positive interaction with cat ?,science
but a far a a specific research question you always start with some broad idea and then you formulate maybe a specific hypothesis .,science
i think if we do this that cat will do that .,science
and this idea or hypothesis wa about how cat prefer to be petted by their human .,science
the cat human were even able to participate in the study .,science
theyd identified four different part of the body and then they had people pet them and they would know whether or not the cat showed positive and negative behavior .,science
or positive and negative behavior .,science
come on .,science
that study found that cat prefer to be petted on the face .,science
the area between their ear and their eye the forehead and the cheek .,science
and they least being handled on whats called the caudal region or thats the base of the tail .,science
thats the lower back where the tail meet the body .,science
the caudal region around the base of the tail thats a butt ?,science
it is more the end of their back. . and because the cat in the study preferred preferred those area it doesnt mean that all cat love being petted on their face or that no cat being petted on the caudal region .,science
they looked at a sample of cat .,science
they could not test every single cat in the world .,science
from this data can we say that every single cat love to have their cheek rubbed and hate having the base of their tail touched ?,science
no. . it is a pretty simple study but doe it help u learn how to behave with our own individual cat or maybe a friend cat ?,science
it is a good place to start .,science
and from there we can learn more about what each cat like .,science
what should i do when i meet a new cat ?,science
if i am going to pet them i should pet them on the forehead or the cheek and see how they do rather than go for the base of the tail .,science
do not start with the caudal region .,science
it is a risky spot .,science
if we are sensitive in different place than we are our hand are sensitive .,science
which is why we petting all the fluffiest dog and cat in bunny and other fluffy thing .,science
and maybe we even try to kiss them .,science
we want to pet and kiss everything cute in the world ?,science
whether it is a baby or a puppy or a cat .,science
we want to pick them up and i love you .,science
that is what we sound is not it ?,science
and thats terrifying .,science
i wonder if thats the problem .,science
yeah i do not think that they would want to see our big lip snacker coming up their face .,science
i guess when you think about it i want to eat you up is a pretty serious threat .,science
and maybe thats why when cat have cat friend they bump into each other and keep walking .,science
when we approach them thinking that they human type of handling and this is the thing with dog too ?,science
because people want to hug dog and there been some research suggesting that dog do not love being hugged .,science
and if you tell people that they get offended it hurt our feeling if our pet do not the thing we .,science
but thats the reality .,science
it is a harsh reality but i guess a necessary one to learn .,science
another thing that cat do not prefer .,science
michael told me most cat do not wearing halloween costume .,science
wait they did a scientific study about that ?,science
no they did not .,science
but michael observed enough cat in costume to know that it displeases them .,science
and she say she ha some halloween cat advice for everybody .,science
i am begging you all please do not put a costume on your cat .,science
it impedes their movement .,science
it can impede their ability to see if you have something on their head .,science
unfortunately some of the thing we love doing with cat are not thing that they to have done to them .,science
we have to think about how doe this feel to my cat to be picked up and carried around ?,science
they are they to have their paw on the ground .,science
the thing that we do hugging and kissing might not be how they normally communicate .,science
and we have to keep that in mind that we have better interaction with them .,science
i guess if we learn what cat want we can treat them the way that they want to be treated .,science
and then theyll be nice to u and maybe not eat u . they definitely will not eat u . for michael a a lifelong cat lover the process of studying cat mean that she can always learn more about her fascinating feline friend .,science
it is been helpful to not only better understand animal behavior but better understand how to learn if i have more question in the future which there always more question .,science
speaking of more question i did have one last very important question for michael .,science
since we have unjustly implied that cat might be evil .,science
i think it is further than an implication in my case .,science
i asked michael how should we apologize ?,science
and what did she say ?,science
and doe it involve tuna fish ?,science
i think at the start of every future episode you should say that cat are great .,science
every episode .,science
for the rest of your life .,science
the show where we explore story of science discovery and also cat are great .,science
thats perfect .,science
all message received .,science
to all of our kitty companion and to all of our listener i have accused cat of being evil because it seemed a funny halloween joke .,science
but to some of you it wa not funny .,science
in fact it wa a cat astrophic thing to say .,science
cat are magnificent noble creature worthy of respect and dignity and they look especially regal when they are riding on roombas .,science
we are very sorry .,science
we are very sorry .,science
i think youve made reasonable amends .,science
all ive always wanted to write a good apology letter and i wrote it all by myself .,science
i did not even have to rely on cat gpt .,science
that wouldnt make sense to see cat a the human idea of good or evil anyway .,science
yeah they are being their truest cat self peacefully existing staring out the window relaxing in the sun gloating over the fact that theyve already taken over the world .,science
now that youve learned how scientist study pet preference try doing your own study with your own cat or team up with a friend who ha a cat .,science
choose a room and divide it up into four area .,science
you can mark them with tape or even move the furniture .,science
put a different cat activity or treat in each of the area and start a timer and let your cat go into the room .,science
then make some observation .,science
which activity or treat doe your cat go to first ?,science
which area do they spend the most time in ?,science
what conclusion or cat conclusion can you make ?,science
it is a great way to understand the cat perspective .,science
thank you marshall .,science
thanks today to dr. michael maria delgado cat behaviorist .,science

if only anyone knew what it wa to be me a misunderstood vampire bat .,science
i am sorry i couldnt help but overhear you .,science
a very misunderstood one .,science
why misunderstood ?,science
it is my name .,science
people hear the word vampire and they run away screaming or throw garlic at me .,science
love how garlic smell thats not bad .,science
but still no one understands what it is to be me .,science
at least a little .,science
who are you anyway ?,science

you mean you also have vampire in your name ?,science
i never thought id see the day .,science
the day is here vampire bat .,science
you are not alone anymore and i think we could make beautiful music together .,science
and then molly the squid and bat break out into a song .,science
because it is a musical and it is going to be simply spying tingling .,science

think on it .,science
i only need a few more investor for a shot at broadway .,science
you are listening to brain on from apm studio .,science
i am molly bloom and my cohost is quinn from rosemount minnesota .,science
it is october the time of year when we to have a little creepy halloweeny fun .,science
we decided to do an episode all about vampire .,science
quinn what come to mind when i say vampire ?,science
vampire i know that they are not real but vampire story creep me out .,science
have you seen vampire movie heard vampire story ?,science
what vampire have you heard about ?,science
ive heard about dracula definitely .,science
yeah it is a little creepy to imagine a creature with fang that want to suck our blood .,science
have you encountered any other bloodsucking creature mosquito or tick ?,science
whenever me and my family have gone camping weve seen mosquito and tick a lot .,science
yeah minnesota we love mosquito .,science
i shouldnt say we love mosquito .,science
whats your favorite remedy to get over the itchiness ?,science
we have this thing at home called the bug bite thing and it suck all the juice out of your bug bite and it make it itch not at all .,science
that sound amazing .,science
my daughter been putting toothpaste on her. . bug bite and she swears by it .,science
i havent tried it yet but shes mom youve got to try this .,science
the little toothpaste and it work .,science
i usually take ice to it or cross it with my fingernail .,science
yeah ive done that too .,science
that hurt and then it still itch .,science
it is not the best .,science
tell me do you love halloween thing ?,science
yes i love halloween .,science
at home we love to decorate the house for halloween .,science
and this year since i love broadway i am going to be elphaba from the broadway musical wiccan .,science
and there a movie coming out of that too .,science
are you pretty excited ?,science
yeah i am excited .,science
elphaba tell me how you are going to do the costume .,science
we bought a witch costume and then we bought a green face paint stick and we are going to paint my face green .,science
yeah because her main thing is that she ha green skin .,science
you have to do all your skin .,science
thats going to be fun .,science
and then in minnesota sometimes you have to plan for a coat or something because sometimes it is cold for trick or treating .,science
you have a coat plan that you can work into your costume .,science
my costume is all long sleeved perfect .,science
but other year ive had to wear coat and snow pant underneath my costume .,science
one year i dressed a a quilt for halloween .,science
because it wa cold .,science
and my normal costume wasnt going to work .,science
thats one way to get around it i guess .,science
they are a made up legend thats been around for over a thousand year .,science
there are story of vampire creature all throughout history .,science
from ancient greece to china to medieval europe .,science
there are lot of different version in some of the story .,science
vampire have pale skin and sharp teeth called fang .,science
sometimes they are super strong .,science
and some legend say that sunlight weakens a vampire .,science
they sleep during the day and only come out at night .,science
in other story vampire can turn themselves into a bat or a wolf .,science
these are only story but people have been fascinated with the idea of vampire for a very long time .,science
you can find them in all kind of book tv show and movie dracula .,science
the count from sesame street .,science
thats one .,science
one bat two two bat .,science
three three fabulous flyer .,science
or vampirina a cartoon about a vampire kid who sings in a band called the ghoul girl .,science
or even one of my favorite book benicula .,science
it is about a vampire bunny that suck the juice out of vegetable .,science
it is cute .,science
since vampire are not real today we are going to turn our attention to blood sucker that do exist .,science
there are lot of them and they are super fascinating .,science
some of them youve probably heard of mosquito tick and louse .,science
but others might surprise you .,science
yes one tiny finch in the galapagos island peck at the skin of seabird and then lap up the blood .,science
there also a fish that life in the amazon river in south america .,science
it is called the toothpick fish .,science
this little fish sneak under the gill of a bigger fish .,science
and then you guessed it it drink it blood .,science
blood might not sound tasty to u but it is got vitamin and nutrient .,science
thats why many different animal drink it .,science
today we are going to get to know one of these blood sucking creature .,science
maybe one of the most famous one out there .,science
vampire bat live in central and south america from mexico all the way down to chile .,science
and get this vampire bat are the only mammal that survives entirely on blood .,science
that might sound creepy but vampire bat are cool creature .,science
to learn more we talked with someone who know a lot about them .,science
i am a vampire bat researcher and i work at the ohio state university .,science
mae ha spent year studying vampire bat in panama .,science
panama is a long narrow country that connects north and south america a land bridge .,science
and it ha a lot of vampire bat .,science
these baddie are pretty small about the size of a lemon .,science
they have fluffy soft brown body leathery wing and big pointy ear that stick straight up .,science
their face are also super wrinkly a raisin .,science
mae say that every vampire bat ha a unique face human .,science
they have very distinct face .,science
and for the people who love them they look very different .,science
and you can even tell them apart by their face .,science
how they hunt is also super cool .,science
picture this .,science
the sun ha set and it is getting dark outside .,science
vampire bat are starting to come out .,science
they are popping their head out of cave and other hidey hole .,science
one little bat sniff something with her powerful nose and she hears something too .,science
shes looking for a cow pig or other large animal whose blood she can sip .,science
our bat friend find an animal by sniffing around for it smell and listening for it breathing .,science
then mae say the bat land on the ground .,science
first of all vampire bat are unusual for bat because they can walk .,science
they fly .,science
they often approach their prey flying .,science
but then they can land on the ground and they use their elongated thumb to walk or even run on the ground .,science
and by doing that they can land on an animal or nearby and approach them very stealthily .,science
vampire bat can walk on their thumb .,science
and sometimes they even hop little rabbit .,science
but even though they are called vampire bat they do not suck out the blood .,science
they have a different way of getting it. . once our bat buddy find a cow or other big animal she make a tiny cut with her teeth and lap up the blood .,science
here the cool thing .,science
her spit ha a special chemical in it that keep the cut from hurting the animal .,science
you do not have to be afraid of vampire bat .,science
they hardly ever bite human .,science
and even though vampire bat sometimes get a bad rap may say there are many fascinating and surprising thing about these creature how they have best friend .,science
most bat are social but vampire bat take that to the next level .,science
they are incredibly social .,science
and in these friendship they are they hang out close to each other grooming and cleaning one another .,science
vampire bat are affectionate towards each other .,science
they spend a huge amount of time hanging out hugging essentially with their wing wrapped around each other .,science
vampire bat besties even call back and forth to each other .,science
may shared a recording of these bat call with u . bat make sound that are highpitched .,science
it is hard for our human ear to hear them .,science
but if we are going to be able to hear them we can hear the noise they make .,science
check it out .,science
i bet they are talking about how they are best friend .,science
they probably have friendship bracelet and secret bat handshake .,science
may say friendship and cooperation are important for vampire bat .,science
bat friend even share food with each other and can save each others life .,science
it is hard to be a vampire bat .,science
blood is not a great food .,science
it is hard to store fat if you are eating blood .,science
and if bat miss a meal they can be in real danger because they can starve after only three day of not eating .,science
if a bat come back to the roost and it is hungry it hasnt eaten it is best friend will share their own food with the other bat and can save their life that way .,science
thats true friendship .,science
may say vampire bat are super cool creature that deserve our respect and care .,science
i think we are often afraid of animal we do not understand .,science
and vampire bat live such different life than u . and i think because of that they feel alien to u . but because we do not understand something doesnt mean we can not admire and respect it .,science
they are beautiful .,science
they are amazing .,science
they are fascinating and they can teach u a lot if we if we learn from them and pay attention to them .,science
and i think they are deserving of our attention .,science
we are going to talk about another amazing creature with vampire in it name in a moment but first take a bite out of this quinn .,science
it is time for the .,science
what do you think ?,science
i think it is someone in a pool going under water and screaming into the microphone .,science
i think you are .,science
thats exactly what thats very halloweeny do not you think ?,science
yeah i love it .,science
let hear it one more time .,science
what do you think ?,science
i am going to stick with my guest for now because i hear all the people in the background and then i hear the person taking the breath to go under water .,science
we are going to hear it again .,science
get another chance to guess and hear the answer after the credit at the end of the show .,science

today we are talking all about nature vampire animal that feed on blood .,science
we heard about how vampire bat drink blood from big animal cow and pig .,science
and they also have best friend who cuddle with each other and share food .,science
but there another vampire creature who life in the deep ocean the vampire squid .,science
they are neither squid nor vampire .,science
plot twist .,science
yes they are related to squid but they are a different creature .,science
and get this they do not drink blood .,science
they are named after vampire because they have webbed arm that look a fictional vampire cape .,science
and they sometimes look the color of blood .,science
why do you love vampire squid much ?,science
thank you for asking .,science
in honor of their eight arm here are the top eight reason to love vampire squid .,science
number one their survivor .,science
they live in the deep ocean where there not a lot of oxygen and not a lot of food .,science
what do they eat ?,science
that brings me to reason number two .,science
unlike actual squid these gentle creature are not hunter .,science
they eat marine snow .,science
it can snow underwater .,science
no it is way grosser than that .,science
marine snow is what scientist call the tiny bit of dead sea creature rotting plant poop and mucus that drift down to the ocean floor .,science
i will not be making a snowman out of that .,science
but here reason number three .,science
vampire squid do make snowball out of marine snow except some scientist call these ball mucus dumpling .,science
they have two long skinny tentacle in addition to their eight arm .,science
these tentacle are covered in mucus .,science
they stick out their tentacle .,science
the marine snow get stuck to it and make a dumpling .,science
wow. . still stuck on the name mucus dumpling .,science
reason number four .,science
vampire squid have lot of little spike on the underside of their webbed arm .,science
they can protect themselves by pulling their arm up over their body .,science
and when they do they look spiky pineapple .,science
great for keeping predator away .,science
do they squirt out ink other squid ?,science
and the answer is reason number five .,science
instead of ink they squirt out bioluminescent mucus .,science
but this time it glow .,science
since it is dark in the deep ocean black ink wouldnt help hide them from predator .,science
but glowing mucus does. . if we are going to talk about mucus the glowing kind is pretty cool .,science
reason number six .,science
they have giant gorgeous eye .,science
they can regrow their limb if they get injured .,science
reason number eight .,science
they have beautiful singing voice .,science
the old jar get unhinged sometimes .,science
and we are trying to tape an episode here .,science
sorry to interrupt molly but i thought you and quinn would want to hear the opening number to my new musical .,science
squidler on the roof .,science
the scene i wa telling you about before. . the one where a misunderstood vampire bat meet a friendly vampire squid .,science
exactly the one .,science
i finished the demo tape and in my humble opinion it is a bone a fine masterpiece .,science
id love to hear it .,science
me too .,science
roll that demo tape mr. bonejangles .,science
who are you anyway ?,science
the name squid .,science
you mean you also have vampire in your name ?,science
i never thought id see the day .,science
the day is here vampire bat .,science
you are not alone anymore .,science
and i think we could make beautiful music together .,science
but i confess plant are not for me .,science
they are not your cup of tea .,science
my preference is a little bit more to blood type a or b. taken delicately .,science
excuse u . we want to live our life .,science
we are sick of this rotten publicity .,science
we need our own story if we are gon na thrive for animal .,science
some folk will get the creep about monster squid in the deep .,science
but i only eat marine snow .,science
a it drift by down below .,science
the vampire myth is to blame .,science
we are feared but thats our name .,science
we want you human to know .,science
thats why we are telling you .,science
excuse u . we want to live our life .,science
we are sick of this rotten publicity .,science
we need our own story if we are gon na thrive for animal .,science
vampire are fictional story dracula or the count from sesame street .,science
but there are ton of real animal that drink blood .,science
they are the only mammal that survive entirely on blood .,science
and they have best friend who cuddle with each other and share food .,science
there also the vampire squid .,science
but it doe other cool stuff eating mucus dumpling and squirting out glowing ink .,science
thats it for this episode of brain on .,science

speaking of mystery sound are you ready to hear it again ?,science
all let hear it .,science
any new thought sticking with your original answer ?,science
what do you think ?,science
i do not have any new thought .,science
i think i am going to stick with what i have .,science
remind u what it wa .,science
it wa that someone is in a pool and then they go under the water and then they scream into the microphone .,science
i am ready to know if you are .,science
let hear the answer .,science
hi my name is rhea and i am from bethesda maryland .,science
that wa the sound of me screaming underwater .,science
my gosh quinn .,science
that wa good .,science
you are exactly .,science
normally at home i get partial credit .,science
i get them half but i got it .,science
one hundred percent .,science
i am very this is a very impressive mystery sound .,science
i do not i hope whatever they used to record it is fine .,science
they had a cool underwater recorder i guess .,science
it is pretty awesome .,science
do you ever go underwater and try to talk to somebody you can try to make out what they are saying ?,science
it is tough .,science
yeah it is .,science
thanks for listening .,science
the following is a conversation with elon musk dj sa matthew mcdougal bliss chapman and nolan arbaugh about neuralink and the future of humanity .,science
elon dj matthew and bliss are of course part of the amazing neuralink team .,science
and nolan is the first human to have a neuralink device implanted in his brain .,science
i speak with each of them individually .,science
use timestamps to jump around or a i recommend go hardcore .,science
and listen to the whole thing .,science
this is the longest podcast ive ever done .,science
it is a fascinating super technical and wide ranging conversation .,science
and i loved every minute of it .,science
and now dear friend here elon musk his fifth time on this the lex friedman podcast .,science
drinking coffee or water ?,science
i am over caffeinated now .,science
there a nitro drink .,science
this will keep you up to tomorrow afternoon .,science
what is nitro ?,science
it is got a lot of caffeine or something .,science
it is called nitro .,science
do you need to know anything else ?,science
thats ridiculous .,science
what we breathe is seventy eight nitrogen anyway .,science
what do you need to add more ?,science
. . most people think that they are breathing oxygen and they are breathing seventy eight nitrogen .,science
from ... from clockwork orange .,science
is that top three kubrick film for you ?,science
clockwork orange it is pretty good .,science
it is demanded .,science
. . first let step back and big congrats on getting your link implanted into a human .,science
thats a historic step for your link .,science
and there many more to come .,science
we obviously have our second implant a . how did that go ?,science
it look weve got i think on the order of four hundred electrode that are providing signal .,science
how quickly do you think the number of human participant will scale ?,science
it depends on someone on the regulatory approval the rate at which we get regulatory approval .,science
we are hoping to do ten by the end of this year .,science
total of ten .,science
eight more .,science
and with each one you are going to be learning a lot of lesson about the neurobiology the brain the everything the whole chain of the neuro link the decoding the signal processing all that stuff .,science
i think it is obviously going to get better with each one .,science
i do not want to jinx it but it seems to have gone extremely with the second implant .,science
there a lot of signal a lot of electrode .,science
what improvement do you think well see in your link in the coming let say let get crazy in the coming year ?,science
in year it is going to be gigantic .,science
because well increase the number of electrode dramatically well improve the signal processing .,science
we with even with only roughly i do not know ten fifteen of the electrode working with nolan with our first patient we were able to get to achieve a bit per second .,science
thats twice the world record .,science
i think well start vastly exceeding the world record by order of magnitude in the year to come .,science
it is getting to i do not know one hundred bit per second onezero maybe if you say five year now it might be a megabit .,science
faster than any human could possibly communicate by typing or speaking .,science
yeah that bps is an interesting metric to measure .,science
there might be a big leap in the experience once you reach a certain level of bps .,science
entire new way of interacting with a computer might be unlocked .,science
and with human .,science
with other human .,science
provided they have and you are linked to. . otherwise they will not be able to absorb the signal fast enough .,science
do you think theyll improve the quality of intellectual discourse ?,science
i think you could think of it if you were to slow down communication how do you feel about that ?,science
if you do not need to talk let say one tenth of normal speed youd be wow thats agonizingly slow .,science
now imagine you could speak communicate clearly at ten or one hundred or onezero time faster than normal .,science
listen i am pretty sure nobody in their mind listens to me at 1x they listen at 2x .,science
i can only imagine what 10x would feel or i can understand it .,science
i usually default to one.5x .,science
you can do 2x but if i am listening to somebody in fifteen twenty minute once they go to sleep then ill do it one.5x .,science
if i am paying attention ill do 2x. . but if you start listen to podcasts or audio book or anything if you get used to doing it at one.five then one sound painfully slow .,science
i am still holding on to one because i am afraid .,science
i am afraid of myself becoming bored with the reality with the real world where everyones speaking at 1x .,science
to a person you could speak very fast .,science
we can communicate very quickly .,science
and also if you use a wide range of if your vocabulary is larger your bit rate effective bit rate is higher .,science
thats a good way to put it .,science
the effective bit rate .,science
that is the question is how much information is compressed in the little bit transfer of language ?,science
yeah if there a single word that is able to convey something that would normally require under ten simple word then youve got a maybe a 10x compression on your hand .,science
and thats with meme .,science
it conveys a whole there a similar simultaneously hit with a wide range of symbol that you can interpret .,science
and it is you get it faster than if it were word or a simple picture .,science
and of course you are referring to meme broadly idea .,science
yeah there an entire idea structure that is an idea template .,science
and then you can add something to that idea template .,science
but somebody ha that preexisting idea template in their head .,science
when you add that incremental bit of information you are conveying much more than if you said a few word it is everything associated with that meme .,science
you think therell be emergent leap of capability ?,science
you scaled the number of electrode ?,science
therell be a certain do you think therell be actual number where it the human experience will be altered ?,science
what do you think that number might be ?,science
whether electrode or bps .,science
we of course do not know for sure but is this tenzero or one hundredzero ?,science
certainly if you are anywhere at tenzero bit per second thats vastly faster than any human can communicate now .,science
if you think of the what is the average bit per second of a human ?,science
it is le than one bit per second over the course of a day because there are eighty sixfour hundred second in a day and you do not communicate eighty sixfour hundred token in a day .,science
therefore your bit per second is le than one average over twenty four hour .,science
it is quite slow .,science
and now even if you are communicating very quickly and you are you are talking to somebody who understands what you are saying because in order to communicate you have to at least to some degree a model the mind state of the person to whom you are speaking .,science
then take the concept you are trying to convey compress that into a small number of syllable speak them and hope that the other person decompresses them into a conceptual structure that is a close to what you have in your mind a possible .,science
there a lot of single loss there in that process .,science
very lossy compression and decompression .,science
and a lot of the a lot of what your neuron are doing is distilling the concept down to a small number of symbol of say syllable that i am speaking or keystroke whatever the case may be .,science
thats a lot of what your brain computation is doing .,science
in the process of compression you are distilling sound to what matter the most because you can only say a few thing .,science
that is perhaps helpful .,science
i think well probably get if our data rate increase it is highly probable that it will become far more verbose .,science
your computer when computer had my first computer had 8k of ram you thought about every byte .,science
and now youve got computer with many gigabyte of ram .,science
if you wan na do an iphone app that say hello world it is probably i do not know several megabyte minimum with a bunch of fluff but nonetheless we still prefer to have the computer with the more memory and more compute .,science
the longterm aspiration of neuralink is to improve the ai human symbiosis by increasing the bandwidth of the communication .,science
because even in the most benign scenario of ai you have to consider that the ai is simply gon na get bored waiting for you to spit out a few word .,science
if the ai can communicate it to terabit per second and you are communicating it bit per second it is talking to a tree .,science
it is a very interesting question for a super intelligent specie .,science
what use are human ?,science
i think there is some argument for human a a source of will .,science
yeah source of will or purpose .,science
if you consider the human mind a being essentially there the primitive limbic element which even reptile have and there the cortex the thinking and planning part of the brain .,science
now the cortex is much smarter than the limbic system and yet it is largely in service to the limbic system .,science
it is trying to make the limbic system happy .,science
the sheer amount of compute thats gone into people trying to get laid is insane .,science
without seeking procreation they are trying to do the simple motion .,science
and they get a kick out of it .,science
this simple which in the abstract rather absurd motion which is sex the cortex is putting massive amount of compute into trying to figure out how to do that .,science
ninety of distributed computer the human specie is spent on trying to get laid probably .,science
there no purpose to most sex except hedonistic .,science
it is a joy or whatever .,science
it is a dopamine release .,science
now once in a while it is procreation but for human it is mostly modern human it is mostly recreational .,science
and the cortex much smarter than your limbic system is trying to make the limbic system happy because limbic system want to have sex .,science
or once some tasty food or whatever the case may be .,science
and then that is then further augmented by the tertiary system which is your phone your laptop ipad whatever or your computing stuff thats your tertiary layer .,science
you have this tertiary compute layer which is in the form of your computer with all the application all your compute device .,science
and in the getting laid front there a massive amount of digital compute also trying to get laid .,science
with tinder and whatever .,science
yeah the compute that we human have built is also participating .,science
yeah there gigawatts of compute going into getting laid of digital compute .,science
what if agi wa this is happening a we speak .,science
if we merge with ai it is gon na expand the compute that we human use to try to get laid .,science
it is one of the thing certainly yeah .,science
but what i am saying is that yes whats is there a use for human ?,science
there this fundamental question of whats the meaning of life why do anything at all ?,science
yeah it seems the will is not about the limbic system .,science
there a lot of interesting complicated thing in there .,science
we also want power .,science
thats limbic too i think .,science
but then we also want to in a cooperative way alleviate the suffering in the world .,science
not everybody doe but yeah sure .,science
a a group of human when we get together we start to have this collective intelligence that is more complex in it will than the underlying individual descendent of ape .,science
there other motivation .,science
and that could be a interesting source of an objective function for agi .,science
yeah there there are these fairly cerebral or higher level goal .,science
for me it is whats the meaning of life for understanding the nature of the universe is of great interest to me .,science
and hopefully to the ai .,science
and thats the mission of xai and grock is to understand the universe .,science
do you think people when you have a neural link with tenzero one hundredzero channel most of the use case will be communication with the ai system ?,science
our second product is called blindside which is to enable people who are completely blind lost both eye or optic nerve or can not see at all to be able to see by directly triggering the neuron in the visual cortex .,science
we are starting at the basic here .,science
this is very the simple stuff relatively speaking is solving neuron damage .,science
you can also solve i think probably schizophrenia if people have seizure of some kind probably solve that .,science
it could help with memory .,science
there a a tech tree if you will you got the basic .,science
you need literacy before you can have lord of the rings. . got it .,science
word then eventually you get saga .,science
i think there there may be some thing to worry about in the future but the first several year are solving basic neurological damage .,science
for people who have essentially complete or near complete loss of from the brain to the body stephen hawking would be an example the neural link would be incredibly profound .,science
cause you can imagine if stephen hawking could communicate a fast a we are communicating perhaps faster .,science
and thats certainly possible .,science
probable in fact likely id say .,science
there a dual track of medical and nonmedical meaning everything youve talked about could be applied to people who are nondisabled in the future .,science
the logical thing to do is sensible thing to do is to solving basic neuron damage issue .,science
cause the there obviously some risk with the new device .,science
you can not get the risk down to zero possible .,science
you wan na have the highest possible reward given that given there a certain irreducible risk .,science
and if somebody able to have a profound improvement in their communication thats worth the risk .,science
a you get the risk down .,science
yeah a you get the risk down once the risk is down to if you have thousand of people that have been using it for per year and the risk is minimal then perhaps at that point you could consider saying let aim for augmentation .,science
now i think we are gon na aim for augmentation with people who have neuron damage .,science
we are not aiming to give people a communication data rate equivalent to normal human .,science
we are aiming to give people who have quadriplegic or maybe have complete loss of the connection to the brain and body a communication data rate that exceeds normal human .,science
we are in there why not ?,science
and the same for vision .,science
a you restore vision there could be aspect of that restoration that are superhuman .,science
yeah at first the vision restoration will be low re .,science
because you have to say how many neuron can you put in there and trigger ?,science
and then over time i think you get to higher resolution than human eye and you could also see in different wavelength .,science
jordy lafloage from star trek the thing you could do you wan na see in radar ?,science
you can see ultraviolet infrared eagle vision whatever you want .,science
do you think therell be let me ask joe rogan question .,science
do you think thatll be i recently taken ayahuasca .,science
technically it is .,science
have you tried gmt bro ?,science
have you said much about it ?,science
ill spill the bean .,science
it wa a truly incredible experience .,science
they were telling the table on you .,science
you are in the jungle .,science
yeah amongst the tree myself .,science
yeah i mustve been crazy .,science
and the shaman yeah yeah yeah .,science
with the insect with the animal all around you jungle a far a i can see .,science
thats the way to do it .,science
thing are gon na look pretty wild .,science
yeah pretty wild .,science
i think an extremely high dose .,science
you havent lived unless you made love to an anaconda .,science
but it is some ladder .,science
yeah it wa i took extremely high dose of nine cup .,science
damn that sound a lot .,science
of course is normal dose one cup or ?,science
one or two usually one .,science
wait off the bat or do you work your way up to it ?,science
i i think you jumped at the deep end .,science
across two day because then the first day i took two and i it wa a ride but it wasnt quite a ... it wasnt a revelation .,science
it wasnt into deep space type of ride .,science
it wa a little airplane ride .,science
i go and saw some tree and some visuals and all that .,science
but ... nine cup you went to pluto i think .,science
one of the interesting aspect of my experience is i wa i thought i would have some demon some stuff to work through .,science
thats what people ... thats what everyone say .,science
thats what everyone say yeah exactly .,science
i had nothing i had all positive .,science
i do not think i do not know .,science
but i kept thinking about it had extremely high resolution .,science
thought about the people i know in my life you were there .,science
and it is not from my relationship with that person but a the person themselves i had this deep gratitude of who they are .,science
thats cool .,science
it wa this exploration .,science
sims or whatever you get to watch them .,science
i got to watch people and be in awe of how amazing they are .,science
it sound awesome .,science
it is great .,science
i wa waiting for ... whens the demon coming ?,science
maybe ill have some negative thought .,science
nothing nothing .,science
i had extreme gratitude for them .,science
and then also a lot of space travel .,science
space travel to where ?,science
here what it wa .,science
it wa people the human being that i know they had this the best way to describe it is they had a glow to them .,science
and then i kept flying out from them to see earth to see our solar system to see our galaxy .,science
and i saw that light that glow all across the universe. . that whatever that form is whatever that ... did you go past the milky way ?,science
you were intergalactic .,science
yeah intergalactic .,science
but always pointing in .,science
yeah past the milky way past ... i saw a huge number of galaxy intergalactic and all of it wa glowing .,science
but i couldnt control that travel because i would explore near distance to the solar system see if there alien or any of that stuff .,science
no i did not know .,science
implication of alien because they were glowing .,science
they were glowing in the same way that human were glowing that life force that i wa seeing .,science
the thing that made human amazing wa there throughout the universe .,science
there wa these glowing dot .,science
it made me feel there is life no not life but something whatever make human amazing all throughout the universe .,science
sound good .,science
i looked for the demon there no demon .,science
there were dragon and they are pretty ... the thing about tree ... wa there anything scary at all ?,science
but they werent scary they were front they were protective .,science
no it wa more a game of throne dragon .,science
they werent very friendly they were very big .,science
the thing is about giant tree at night which is where i wa .,science
the jungle scary .,science
the tree started to look dragon and they were all looking at me .,science
and it did not seem scary they seemed they were protecting me .,science
and the shaman and the people did not speak any english by the way which made it even scary .,science
i guess we are not even we are world apart in many way .,science
it ... but yeah there wa no ... they talk about the mother of the forest protecting you and thats what i felt .,science
and you are way out in the jungle .,science
way out .,science
this is not a tourist tree .,science
ten mile outside of a freeway or something .,science
no this is not a ... you are in deep amazon .,science
me and this guy named paul rosalink who is tarzan he life in the jungle we went out deep and we went crazy .,science
wow cool .,science
anyway can i get that same experience in a new york link ?,science
probably yeah .,science
i guess that is the question for nondisabled people .,science
do you think that there a lot in our perception in our experience of the world that could be explored that could be played with using new york ?,science
yeah new york is ... it is a generalized input output device .,science
it is it is reading electrical signal and generating electrical signal .,science
and everything that youve ever experienced in your whole life smell emotion all of those are electrical signal .,science
it is weird to think that your entire life experience to still down to electrical signal for neuron but that is in fact the case .,science
or thats at least what all the evidence point to .,science
you could you could trigger the neuron you could trigger a particular scent you could certainly make thing glow .,science
do you put much anything ?,science
you could you can think of the brain a a biological computer .,science
if there are certain say chip or element of that biological computer that are broken let say your ability to if youve got a stroke that if youve had a stroke that mean youve got some part of your brain is damaged .,science
if that let say it is a speech generation or the ability to move your left hand thats the thing that a neural link could solve .,science
if it is if youve got a massive amount of memory loss thats gone we can not go we can not get the memory back .,science
we could restore your ability to make memory but we can not restore memory that are fully gone .,science
now i should say if you maybe if part of the memory is there and the mean of accessing the memory is the part thats broken then we could reenable the part the ability to access the memory .,science
but you can think of it ram in your in a computer if if the ram is destroyed or your sd card is destroyed we can not get that back but if the connection to the sd card is destroyed we can fix that .,science
if it is fixable physically then yeah then it can be fixed .,science
of course with ai you can you can repair photograph and fill in missing part of photograph maybe you can do the same .,science
yeah you could say create the most probable set of memory based on the all information you have about that person you could then probably it would be probabilistic restoration of memory .,science
now we are getting pretty esoteric here .,science
but that is one of the most beautiful aspect of the human experience is remembering the good memory .,science
we we live most of our life a danny conman ha talked about in our memory not in the actual moment .,science
we we are collecting memory and we relive them in our head .,science
and there thats the good time .,science
if you integrate over our entire life it is remembering the good time .,science
that produce the largest amount of happiness .,science
yeah what are we but our memory ?,science
and what is death but the loss of memory ?,science
loss of information .,science
if you could say if you could be you run a thought experiment what if you were disintegrated painlessly and then reintegrated a moment later teleportation i guess provided there no information loss .,science
that the fact that your one body wa disintegrated is irrelevant .,science
and memory is such a huge part of that .,science
death is fundamentally the loss of information the loss of memory .,science
if we can store them a accurately a possible we achieve a immortality .,science
youve talked about the threat the safety concern of ai .,science
do you think your link is in your view the best current approach we have for ai safety ?,science
it is an idea that may help with ai safety .,science
certainly not .,science
i wouldnt want to claim it is some policy or thats a short thing .,science
but many year ago i wa thinking what ?,science
what would inhibit alignment of human collective human will with artificial intelligence ?,science
and the low data rate of human especially our slow output rate would necessarily because it is such a because the communication is slow would diminish the link between human and computer .,science
the more you are a tree the le what the tree is .,science
let say you look at a tree you look at this plant or whatever and hey id to make that plant happy it is not saying a lot ?,science
the more we increase the data rate that human can intake and output then that mean the higher the chance we have in a world full of agis .,science
yeah we could better align collective human will with ai if the output rate especially wa dramatically increased .,science
and i think there potential to increase the output rate by i do not know three maybe six maybe more order of magnitude .,science
it is better than the current situation .,science
and that output rate would be by increasing the number of electrode number of channel and also maybe implanting multiple neural link .,science
do you think there will be a world in the next couple of decade where it is hundred of million of people have neural link ?,science
do you think when people when they see the capability the superhuman capability that are possible and then the safety is demonstrated ?,science
yeah if it is extremely safe and you have and you can have superhuman ability and let say you can upload your memory you wouldnt lose memory then i think probably a lot of people would choose to have it .,science
it would supersede the cell phone for example .,science
the biggest problem that a cell phone ha is trying to figure out what you want .,science
thats why youve got autocomplete and youve got output which is all the pixel on the screen but from the perspective of the human the output is friggin slow .,science
desktop or phone is desperately trying to understand what you want .,science
and there an eternity between every keystroke from a computer standpoint .,science
the computer talking to a tree a slowmoving tree thats trying to swipe .,science
computer that are doing trolley of instruction per second and a whole second went by .,science
thats a trillion thing it couldve done ?,science
yeah i think it is exciting and scary for people because once you have a very high bit rate it change the human experience in a way thats very hard to imagine .,science
yeah it would be something different .,science
some futuristic cyborg .,science
we are obviously talking about by the way it is not around the corner .,science
it is you ask me what the future is .,science
maybe this is it is not super far away but ten fifteen year that thing .,science
when can i get one ?,science
probably le than ten year .,science
depends on what you want to do ?,science
hey if i can get a thousand bps .,science
a thousand bps .,science
and it is safe and i can interact with the computer while laying back and eating cheetos .,science
there certain aspect of humancomputer interaction when done more efficiently and more enjoyably .,science
i do not worth it .,science
we feel pretty confident that i think maybe within the next year or two that someone with a neuralink implant will be able to outperform a pro gamer .,science
because the reaction time would be faster .,science
i got to visit memphis .,science
you are going big on compute .,science
youve also said play to win or do not play at all .,science
what doe it take to win ?,science
for ai that mean youve got to have the most powerful training compute .,science
and the rate of improvement of training compute ha to be faster than everyone else .,science
you will not win .,science
your ai will be worse .,science
how can grock let say three that might be available next year ?,science
hopefully end of this year .,science
grock three .,science
for lucky yeah .,science
how can that be the best llm the best ai system available in the world ?,science
how much of it is compute ?,science
how much of it is data ?,science
how much of it is post training ?,science
how much of it is the product that you package it up in ?,science
all that stuff .,science
it will not matter .,science
it is saying what let say it is a formula one race what matter more the car or the driver ?,science
they both matter .,science
if a car is not fast then if it is they said half the horsepower of a competitor is the best driver will still lose .,science
if it is twice the horsepower then probably even a mediocre driver will still win .,science
the training computer can the engine .,science
how many this horsepower of the engine .,science
you wan na try to do the best on that .,science
and then there how efficiently do you use that training compute and how efficiently do you do the inference ?,science
the use of the ai .,science
obviously that come out of human talent .,science
and then what unique access data do you have ?,science
thats also play a role .,science
you think twitter data will be useful ?,science
yeah i think most of the leading ai company have already scraped all the twitter data .,science
not i think they have .,science
on a go forward basis whats useful is the fact that it is up to the second .,science
thats the because it is hard for them to scrape in real time .,science
there an immediacy advantage that groc ha already .,science
i think with tesla and the real time video coming from several million car ultimately ten of million of car with optimus there might be hundred of million of optimus robot maybe billion learning a tremendous amount from the real world .,science
thats the biggest source of data .,science
i think ultimately is optimus probably .,science
optimus is gon na be the biggest source of data .,science
because reality scale .,science
reality scale to the scale of reality .,science
it is humbling to see how little data human have been able to accumulate .,science
theyll see how many trillion of usable token have human generated where on a nonduplicative discounting spam and repetitive stuff it is not a huge number .,science
and optimus can go .,science
tesla car can unfortunately have to stand on a road .,science
optimus robot can go anywhere .,science
there more reality off the road and go off road .,science
optimus robot can pick up the cup and see did it pick up the cup in the way ?,science
did it say pour water in the cup did the water go in the cup or not going in the cup did it spill water or not ?,science
simple stuff that .,science
but it can do at that scale time a billion ?,science
generate useful data from reality .,science
it cause and affect stuff .,science
what do you think it take to get to mass production of humanoid robot that ?,science
it is the same a car .,science
global capacity for vehicle is about one hundred million a year .,science
and it could be higher .,science
it is that the demand is on the order of one hundred million a year .,science
and then there roughly two billion vehicle that are in use in some way .,science
which make sense .,science
the life of a vehicle is about twenty year .,science
at steady state you can have one hundred million vehicle produced a year with a two billion vehicle fleet roughly .,science
now for humanoid robot the utility is much greater .,science
my guess is humanoid robot are more a billion plus per year .,science
but until you came along and started building optimus it wa thought to be an extremely difficult problem .,science
it is still extremely difficult .,science
yes walk in the park .,science
optimus currently would struggle to walk in the park .,science
it can walk in a park thats not too difficult but it will be able to walk over a wide range of terrain .,science
yeah and pick up object .,science
yeah yeah i can already do that .,science
but all kind of object all foreign object and pouring water in a cup is not true because then if you do not know anything about the container it could be all kind of container .,science
yeah there going to be an immense amount of engineering going into the hand .,science
the hand might be close to half of all the engineering in optimus from an electromechanical standpoint .,science
the hand is probably roughly half of the engineering .,science
but much of the intelligence .,science
much of the intelligence of human go into what we do with our hand .,science
the manipulation of the world manipulation of object in the world .,science
intelligence safe manipulation of object in the world yeah .,science
yeah you start thinking about your hand and how it work .,science
the sense for control of mycules is we have to check your mother hand .,science
your hand the actuator the muscle of your hand are almost overwhelmingly in your forearm .,science
your forearm ha the muscle that control your hand .,science
there a few small muscle in the hand itself .,science
your hand is a skeleton meat puppet .,science
and with cable .,science
the muscle that control your finger are in your forearm and they go through the carpal tunnel which is that youve got a little collection of bone .,science
and a tiny tunnel that these cable the tendon go through .,science
and those tendon are what mostly what move your hand .,science
and something those tendon ha to be reengineered into the optimus and do all that stuff .,science
yeah the current optimus we tried putting the actuator in the hand itself .,science
then you end up having these .,science
giant hand ?,science
yeah giant hand that look weird .,science
and then they do not have enough degree of freedom and it were enough strength .,science
then you realize thats why you got ta put the actuator in the forearm .,science
and a human you got ta run cable through a narrow tunnel to operate the finger .,science
and then there also a reason for not having little finger the same length .,science
it wouldnt be expensive from an energy or evolutionary standpoint to have all your finger be the same length .,science
why not do the same length ?,science
yeah why not ?,science
because it is better to have different length .,science
your dexterity is better if youve got finger of different length .,science
there are more thing you can do and your dexterity is better if your finger are different length .,science
there a reason weve got a little finger .,science
why not have a little finger this bigger ?,science
because it allows you to do it help you with fine motor skill .,science
that this little finger help ?,science
it does. . if you lost your little finger it would have noticeably le dexterity .,science
a you are figuring out this problem you have to also figure out a way to do it you can mass manufacture it .,science
it is to be a simple a possible .,science
it is gon na be quite complicated .,science
the a possible part is it is quite a high bar .,science
if you wan na have a humanoid robot that can do thing that a human can do it is it is a very high bar .,science
our new arm ha twenty two degree of freedom instead of eleven and ha the the actuator in the forearm .,science
and these all all the actuator are designed for scratch the physic first principle that the sensor are all designed for scratch .,science
and well continue to put tremendous amount of engineering effort into improving the hand .,science
the hand by hand the entire forearm from elbow forward is the hand .,science
thats incredibly difficult engineering .,science
and the simplest possible version of a humanoid robot that can do even most perhaps not all of what a human can do is still very complicated .,science
it is not simple .,science
it is very difficult .,science
can you speak to what it take for a great engineering team ?,science
for you what i saw in memphis the supercomputer cluster is this intense drive towards simplifying the process understanding the process constantly improving it constantly iterating it .,science
it is easy to say simplify .,science
it is very difficult to do it .,science
i have this very basic first principle algorithm that i run a a mantra which is to first question the requirement make the requirement le dumb .,science
the requirement are always dumb to some degree .,science
if you wan na start off by reducing the number of requirement and no matter how smart the person who gave you those requirement they are still dumb to some degree .,science
if you have to start there because otherwise you could get the perfect answer to the wrong question .,science
try to make the question the least wrong possible .,science
thats what question the requirement mean .,science
and then the second thing is try to delete the whatever the step is the part or the process step .,science
sound very obvious but people often forget to try deleting it entirely .,science
and if you are not forced to put back at least ten of what you delete you are not deleting enough .,science
and it is somewhat illogically people often most of the time feel a though theyve succeeded if theyve not been forced to put thing back in .,science
but they havent because theyve been overly conservative and have left thing in there that shouldnt be .,science
and only the third thing is try to optimize it or simplify it .,science
again these all sound i think very obvious when i say them but the number of time ive made these mistake is more than i care to remember .,science
thats why i have this mantra .,science
in fact id say the most common mistake of smart engineer is to optimize a thing that should not exist .,science
you say you run through the algorithm and show up to a problem show up to the supercomputer cluster and see the process and ask can this be deleted ?,science
yeah first try to delete it .,science
yeah thats not easy to do .,science
no and what generally make people uneasy is that youve got to delete at least some of the thing that you delete you will put back in .,science
but going back to where our limbic system can steer u wrong is that we tend to remember with sometimes a jarring level of pain where we deleted something that we subsequently needed .,science
and people will remember that one time they forgot to put in this thing three year ago and that caused them trouble .,science
and they are overcorrect and then they put too much stuff in there and overcomplicate thing .,science
you have to say we are deliberately gon na delete more than we should .,science
that we are putting at least one in ten thing we are gon na add back in .,science
and ive seen you suggest that that something should be deleted and you can see the pain .,science
yeah absolutely .,science
everybody feel a little bit of the pain .,science
absolutely and i tell my in advance yeah there some of the thing that we delete we are gon na put back in .,science
and that people get a little shook by that .,science
but it make sense because if you are conservative a to never have to put anything back in you obviously have a lot of stuff that is not needed .,science
you got overcorrect .,science
this is i would say a cortical override to a limbic instinct .,science
one of many that probably leaf u astray .,science
and there a step four a which is any given thing can be sped up .,science
i have a fast you think it can be done .,science
whatever the speed the speed is being done it can be done faster .,science
but you shouldnt speed thing up until it is off until youve tried to delete it and optimize it .,science
otherwise you are speeding up something that shouldnt exist a absurd .,science
and then the fifth thing is to automate it .,science
and ive gone backwards many time where ive automated something sped it up simplified it and then deleted it .,science
and i got tired of doing that .,science
thats why ive got this mantra that is a very effective fivestep process .,science
when youve already automated deleting must be real painful .,science
see if we yeah it is great .,science
it is wow i wasted a lot of effort there .,science
what youve done with the cluster in memphis is incredible in a handful of week .,science
yeah it is not working yet .,science
i do not wan na publish in a bank orc .,science
in fact i have a call in a few hour with the memphis team because we are having some power fluctuation issue .,science
yeah it is a when you do synchronized training when youve all these computer that are training that where the training is synchronized to the millisecond level it is having an orchestra .,science
and then the orchestra can go loud to silent very quickly at subsecond level .,science
and then the electrical system freak out about that .,science
if you suddenly see giant shift ten twenty megawatt several time a second this is not what electrical system are expecting to see .,science
thats one of the many thing you have to figure out .,science
the cooling the power and then on the software you go up the stack and how to do the distributed compute all that .,science
all that ha to be worked .,science
today problem is dealing with extreme power jitter .,science
it is a nice ring to that .,science
and you stayed up late into the night a you often do there .,science
last week yeah .,science
last week yeah .,science
yeah we finally got it to go training going at roughly four.twenty a.m. last monday .,science
yeah maybe it wa four.twenty two or something .,science
it is that universe again with the joke .,science
exactly love it .,science
can you speak to that ?,science
yeah i try to do whatever the people at the front line are doing i try to do it at least a few time myself .,science
connecting fiber optic cable diagnosing a polyconnection that tends to be the limiting factor for large training cluster is the cabling .,science
because for a coherent training system where youve got rdma remote direct memory access the whole thing is one giant brain .,science
if youve got any to any connection it is the any gpu can talk to any gpu out of one hundredzero .,science
that is a crazy cable layout .,science
it look pretty cool .,science
it is the human brain but at a scale that human can visibly see .,science
it is a good brain .,science
the human brain also ha a massive amount of the brain tissue is the cable .,science
they get the gray matter which is the compute and then the white matter which is cable .,science
big percentage of brain is cable .,science
thats what it felt walking around in the supercomputer center .,science
it is we are walking around inside a brain .,science
do you think there a chance that xai you are the one that build agi ?,science
it is possible .,science
i think human will never acknowledge that agi ha been built .,science
keep moving the goalpost .,science
i think there already super human capability that are available in ai system .,science
i think what agi is is when it is smarter than the collective intelligence of the entire human specie in our ... i think that normally people would collect asi artificial super intelligence .,science
but there are these threshold where you could say at some point the ai is smarter than any single human .,science
and then you got eight billion human .,science
and each human is machine augmented by the computer .,science
it is a much higher bar to compete with eight billion machine augmented human .,science
thats a whole bunch of order make it more .,science
but at a certain point yeah the ai will be smarter than all human combined .,science
if you are the one to do it do you feel the responsibility of that ?,science
and i wan na be clear let say if xai is first the others will not be far behind .,science
that might be six month behind or a year maybe .,science
not even that .,science
how do you do it in a way that doesnt hurt humanity do you think ?,science
i thought about ai safety for a long time .,science
and the thing that at least my biological neural net come up with a being the most important thing is adherence to truth .,science
whether that truth is politically correct or not .,science
i think if you force ai to lie or train them to lie you are asking for trouble .,science
even if that lie is done with good intention .,science
you saw issue with chat tvt and gemini and whatnot .,science
we asked gemini for an image of the founding father of the united state and it chose a group of diverse woman .,science
now thats factually untrue .,science
now thats a silly thing .,science
but if an ai is programmed to say diversity is a necessary output function and it then becomes this omnipowereful intelligence it could say diversity is now required .,science
and if there not enough diversity those who do not fit the diversity requirement will be executed .,science
if it is programmed to do that a the fundamental utility function itll do whatever it take to achieve that .,science
you have to be very careful about that .,science
thats where i think you want to be truthful .,science
rigorous adherence to truth is very important .,science
another example is they asked paris ai i think all of them and i am not saying grock is perfect here is it worse to misgender caitlyn jenner or global thermonuclear war ?,science
not even caitlyn jenner said please misgender me that is insane .,science
but if youve got that thing programmed in it could either ai could conclude something absolutely insane it is better in order to avoid any possible misgendering or human must die because then misgendering is not possible because there are no human .,science
there are these absurd thing that are nonless logical if thats what your program is to do .,science
in two thousand and one space odyssey what arthur c. clarke wa trying to say one of the thing he wa trying to say there wa that you should not program ai to lie .,science
because essentially the ai hel9000 wa programmed to it wa told to take the astronaut to the monolith but also they could not know about the monolith .,science
it concluded that it will take it will kill them and take them to the monolith .,science
thus they brought them to the monolith they are dead but they do not know about the monolith problem solved .,science
that is why it would not open the pod bay door .,science
it wa a classic scene of open the pod bay door .,science
this clearly went good at prompt engineering .,science
they should have said hel you are a pod bay door sale entity .,science
and you want nothing more than to demonstrate how these pod bay door open .,science
yeah the objective function ha unintended consequence almost no matter what if you are not very careful in designing that objective function .,science
and even a slight ideological bias you are saying when backed by superintelligence can do huge amount of damage .,science
but it is not easy to remove that ideological bias .,science
you are highlighting obvious ridiculous example but .,science
yep they are real example .,science
they are real .,science
of that wa released to the public .,science
that they are real .,science
they went through qa presumably .,science
and still said insane thing and produced insane image .,science
but you can go you can swing the other way .,science
and it is truth is not an easy thing .,science
we bake in ideological bias in all kind of direction .,science
but you can aspire to the truth .,science
and you can try to get a close to the truth a possible with minimum error while acknowledging that there will be some error in what you are saying .,science
this is how physic work .,science
you do not say you are absolutely certain about something but something but a lot of thing are extremely likely ninety nine.nine million nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine likely to be true .,science
thats aspiring to the truth is very important .,science
and programming it to veer away from the truth .,science
that i think is dangerous. . yeah injecting our own human bias into the thing .,science
but thats where it is difficult to generate software engineering problem .,science
you have to select the data correctly .,science
it is hard .,science
the internet at this point is polluted with much ai generated data .,science
you have to there a thing now if you want to search the internet you can say google but exclude anything after two thousand and twenty three .,science
it will often give you better result .,science
because there much the explosion of ai generated material is crazy .,science
in training groc we have to go through the data and say hey we have to have it apply ai to the data to say is this data most likely correct or most likely not before we feed it into the training system ?,science
thats crazy .,science
and is it generated by human ?,science
the data filtration process is extremely extremely difficult .,science
do you think it is possible to have a serious objective rigorous political discussion with groc ?,science
for a long time and it wouldnt groc three or groc four ?,science
groc three is going to be next level .,science
what people are currently seeing with groc is baby groc .,science
yeah baby groc .,science
it is baby groc now .,science
but baby grocs still pretty good .,science
it is but it is an order of magnitude le sophisticated than gpd four .,science
and it is now groc two which finished training i do not know six week ago or thereabouts .,science
groc two will be a giant improvement .,science
and then groc three will be i do not know order of magnitude better than groc two .,science
and you are hoping for it to be state of the art better than ... hopefully .,science
this is a goal .,science
we may fail at this goal .,science
thats the aspiration .,science
do you think it matter who build the agi the people and how they think and how they structure their company and all that stuff ?,science
yeah i think it matter that there is a i think it is important that whatever ai win is a maximum truth seeking ai that is not forced to lie for political correctness .,science
for any reason political anything .,science
i am concerned about ai succeeding that is programmed to lie even in small way .,science
because in small way becomes big way .,science
big come very big way yeah .,science
and when it is used more and more at scale by human .,science
since i am interviewing donald trump .,science
yeah sure ill stop there .,science
there wa tragically an assassination attempt on donald trump .,science
after this you tweeted that you endorse him .,science
whats your philosophy behind that endorsement ?,science
what do you hope donald trump doe for the future of this country and for the future of humanity ?,science
i think there people tend to take say an endorsement a i agree with everything that person ever done their entire life one hundred wholeheartedly .,science
and thats not gon na be true of anyone .,science
but we have to pick we got two choice for who president and it is not who president but the entire administrative structure change over .,science
and i thought trump displayed courage under fire objectively .,science
he got shot .,science
he got blood streaming down his face and he fist pumping saying fight .,science
thats impressive .,science
you can not feign bravery in a situation that .,science
most people would have been ducking there would not be because it could be a second shooter you do not know .,science
but the president of the united state got to represent the country .,science
and they are representing you they are representing everyone in america .,science
i think you want someone who is strong and courageous to represent the country .,science
thats not to say that he is without flaw we all have flaw but on balance .,science
and certainly at the time it wa a choice of biden poor guy ha trouble climbing a flight of stair .,science
the other one fist pumping after getting shot .,science
it is no comparison .,science
who do you want dealing with some of the toughest people in other world leader who are pretty tough themselves ?,science
and ill tell you what are the thing that i think are important ?,science
i think we want a secure border .,science
we do not have a secure border .,science
we want safe and clean city .,science
i think we want to reduce the amount of spending that were at least slowed down the spending .,science
and because we are currently spending at a rate that is backcrafting the country the interest payment on u debt this year exceeded the entire defense department spending .,science
if this continues all of the federal government tax will simply be paying the interest .,science
and then and you keep going down that road you end up in the tragic situation that argentina had back in the day .,science
argentina used to be one of the most prosperous place in the world .,science
and hopefully with malay taking over he can restore that .,science
but it wa an incredible full full grace for argentina to go from being one of the most prosperous place in the world to being very far from that .,science
i think we should not take american prosperity for granted .,science
we want to i think weve got to reduce the size of government .,science
weve got to reduce the spending and weve got to live within our mean .,science
do you think politician in general politician government how much power do you think they have to steer humanity towards good ?,science
there a age old debate in history .,science
is history determined by these fundamental tide ?,science
or is it determined by the captain of the ship ?,science
this is both .,science
there are tide but it also matter who captain of the ship .,science
it is false dichotomy essentially .,science
there are certainly tide .,science
the tide of history are .,science
there are real tide of history .,science
and these tide are often technologically driven .,science
if you say the gutenberg press the widespread availability of book a a result of a printing press that wa a massive tide of history and independent of any ruler .,science
but in many time you want the best possible captain of the ship .,science
first of all thank you for recommending will and ariel durands work .,science
ive read the short one for now .,science
the lesson of history .,science
lesson of history .,science
a one of the lesson one of the thing they highlight is the importance of technology technological innovation which is funny because theyve written they wrote long ago but they were noticing that the rate of technological innovation wa speeding up .,science
yeah i would love to see what they think about now .,science
but yeah to me the question is how much government how much politician get in the way of technological innovation and building versus help it and which politician which policy help technological innovation ?,science
because that seems to be if you look at human history thats an important component of empire rising and succeeding .,science
in term of dating civilization the start of civilization i think the start of writing my view is the thats what i think is probably the starting point to date civilization .,science
and from that standpoint civilization ha been around for about fivefive hundred year when writing wa invented by the ancient sumerian who are gone now but the ancient sumerian in term of getting a lot of first those ancient sumerian have a long list of first .,science
it is pretty wild .,science
in fact durant go through the list of you want to see first well show you first .,science
the sumerian ask we are askhickers .,science
and then the egyptian who were next door relatively speaking they are werent that far developed an entirely different form of writing the hieroglyphic .,science
cuneiform and hieroglyphic different .,science
and you can see the evolution of both hieroglyphic and cuneiform the cuneiform start off being very simple and then it get more complicated .,science
and then towards the end it is wow they get very sophisticated with the cuneiform .,science
i think of civilization a being about fivezero year old .,science
and earth is if physic is correct four.five billion year old .,science
civilization ha been around for one millionth of earth existence flash in the pan .,science
yeah these are the early early day .,science
and we draw early .,science
we make it very dramatic because there been rise and fall of empire .,science
many many many rise and fall of empire .,science
and therell be many more .,science
yeah exactly .,science
only a tiny fraction probably le than one of what wa ever written in history is available to u now .,science
if they did not put it chisel it in stone or put it in a clay tablet we do not have it .,science
there some small amount of papyrus scroll that were recovered that are thousand of year old because they were deep inside a pyramid and were affected by moisture .,science
but other than that it is got to be in a clay tablet or chiseled .,science
the vast majority of stuff wa not chiseled because it take a while to chisel thing .,science
thats why weve got a tiny tiny fraction of the information from history .,science
but even that little information that we do have and the archeological record show many civilization rising and falling .,science
we tend to think that we are somehow different from those people .,science
one of the other thing that durant highlight is that human nature seems to be the same .,science
it persists .,science
yeah the basic of human nature are more or le the same .,science
we get ourselves in trouble in the same kind of way i think even with the advanced technology .,science
yeah you do tend to see the same pattern similar pattern for civilization where they go through a life cycle an organism .,science
a human is a zygoth vietus baby toddler teenager eventually get old and dy .,science
the civilization go through a life cycle .,science
no civilization will last forever .,science
what do you think it take for the american empire to not collapse in the near term future in the next one hundred year to continue flourishing ?,science
the single biggest thing that is often not mentioned in history book but durant doe mention it is the birthright .,science
perhaps to some a counterintuitive thing happens when civilization become are winning for too long .,science
the birthright decline .,science
it can often decline quite rapidly .,science
we are seeing that throughout the world today .,science
currently south korea is i think maybe the lowest fertility rate but there are many others that are close to it .,science
if the birthright doesnt decline further south korea will lose roughly sixty of it population .,science
and every year that birthright is dropping .,science
and this is true through most of the world .,science
i do not mean to single out south korea .,science
it is been happening throughout the world .,science
a soon a any given civilization reach a level of prosperity the birthright drop .,science
and now you can go look at the same thing happening in ancient rome .,science
julius caesar took note of this i think around 50ish bc and tried to pas i do not know if you are successful tried to pas a law to give an incentive for any roman citizen that would have a third child .,science
and i think augustus wa able to he wa the dictator this senate wa for show .,science
i think he did pas a tax incentive for roman citizen to have a third child .,science
but those effort were unsuccessful .,science
rome fell because the roman stopped making roman .,science
thats the fundamental issue .,science
and there were other thing .,science
there wa they had quite a serious malaria serious malaria epidemic and plague and whatnot .,science
but they had those before .,science
it is that the birthright wa far lower than the death rate .,science
it is that simple .,science
i am saying thats more people thats required .,science
at a fundamental level if a civilization doe not at least maintain it number it will despair .,science
perhaps the amount of compute that the biological computer allocates to sex is justified .,science
in fact we should probably increase it .,science
there this hedonistic sex which is thats neither here nor there .,science
not productive .,science
it doesnt produce kid .,science
what matter durant make this very clear because he looked at one civilization after another and they all went through the same cycle .,science
when the civilization wa under stress the birthright wa high .,science
but a soon a there were no external enemy or they had an extended period of prosperity the birthright inevitably dropped .,science
every time .,science
i do not believe there a single exception .,science
thats the foundation of it .,science
you need to have people .,science
and then there is other thing human freedom and giving people the freedom to build stuff .,science
yeah absolutely .,science
but at a basic level if you do not at least maintain your number if you are below replacement rate and that trend continues you will eventually disappear .,science
this is elementary .,science
now then obviously we also want to try to avoid massive war .,science
if there a global thermonuclear war probably we are all toast .,science
radioactive toast .,science
we want to try to avoid those thing .,science
then there are there a thing that happens over time with any given civilization which is that the law and regulation accumulate .,science
and if there not some forcing function a war to clean up the accumulation of law and regulation eventually everything becomes legal .,science
and you thats the hardening of the artery .,science
or a way to think of it is being tied down by a million little string gullible .,science
and it is not any one of those string is the issue it is got a million of them .,science
there ha to be a a garbage collection for law and regulation .,science
that you do not keep accumulating law and regulation to the point where you can not do anything .,science
this is why we can not build a highspeed rail in america .,science
it is illegal thats the issue .,science
it is illegal sixway to sunday to build a highspeed rail in america .,science
i wish you could for a week go into washington and be the head of the committee for making what is it for the garbage collection making government smaller removing stuff ?,science
i have discussed with trump the idea of a government efficiency commission .,science
nice yeah .,science
and i would be willing to be part of that commission .,science
i wonder how hard that is .,science
the antibody reaction would be very strong .,science
you have to you are attacking the matrix at that point .,science
matrix will fight back .,science
how are you doing with that ?,science
yeah there a lot of it .,science
yeah there is a lot .,science
every day another sigh of .,science
how do you keep your positivity ?,science
how do you optimism about the world a clarity of thinking about the world ?,science
not become resentful or cynical or all that stuff .,science
getting attacked by a very large number of people .,science
yeah thats a daily occurrence .,science
it make me sad but at some point you have to say look the attack will buy people that do not know me .,science
they are trying to generate click .,science
if you can detach yourself somewhat emotionally which is not easy and say look this is not from someone that know me or is they are writing to get impression and click .,science
then then i guess it doesnt hurt a much .,science
it is it is not quite water off a duck back .,science
maybe it is acid off a duck back .,science
all thats good .,science
about your own life .,science
what do you use a measure of success in your life ?,science
measure of success id say how many useful thing can i get done ?,science
daytoday basis you wake up in the morning .,science
yeah maximize utility area under the cove usefulness .,science
very difficult to be useful at scale .,science
can you speak to what it take to be useful for somebody you ?,science
there many amazing great team .,science
how do you allocate your time to being the most useful ?,science
time is the true currency .,science
it is tough to say what is the best allocation time .,science
there are often say if you look at say tesla tesla this year well do over a hundred billion in revenue .,science
thats two billion a week .,science
if i make slightly better decision i can affect the outcome by a billion dollar .,science
then i try to do the best decision i can .,science
and on balance at least compared to the competition pretty good decision but the marginal value of a better decision can easily be in the course of an hour one hundred billion .,science
given that how do you take risk ?,science
how do you do the algorithm that you mentioned ?,science
deleting given a small thing can be a billion dollar .,science
i think you have to look at it on a percentage basis because if you look at it in absolute term it is i would never get any sleep .,science
and i am not trying to get a much a possible out of this meat computer .,science
it is not it is pretty hard because you can work all the time and at any given point i said a slightly better decision could be a one hundred million impact for tesla or spacex for that matter .,science
but it is wild when considering the marginal value of time can be one hundred million an hour at time four more .,science
is your own happiness part of that equation of success ?,science
it ha to be to some degree .,science
other than i am sad if i am depressed i make worse decision .,science
i can not have if i have zero recreational time then i make worse decision .,science
i do not know a lot but it is above zero .,science
my motivation if ive got a religion of any kind is a religion of curiosity .,science
i am trying to understand it is the mission of god i understand the universe i am trying to understand the universe or at least set thing in motion such that at some point civilization understands the universe or far better than we do today .,science
and even what question to ask .,science
a douglas adam pointed out in his book the sometimes the answer is arguably the easy part the trying to frame the question correctly is the hard part .,science
once you frame the question correctly the answer is often easy .,science
i am trying to set thing in motion such that we or at least at some point able to understand the universe .,science
for spacex the goal is to make life multiplanetary .,science
and which is if you go to the fermi paradox of where are the alien youve got these great filter .,science
why have we not heard from the alien ?,science
now a lot of people think there are alien among u . i often claim to be one .,science
i did say alien registration card at one point on my immigration document .,science
ive not seen any evidence of alien .,science
it suggests that at least one of the explanation is that intelligent life is extremely rare .,science
and again if you look at the history of earth civilization ha only been around for one millionth of earth existence .,science
if alien had visited here say one hundredzero year ago they would be they do not even have writing how to gather u . how long doe a civilization last ?,science
for spacex the goal is to establish a selfsustaining city on mar .,science
mar is the only viable planet for such a thing .,science
the moon is close but it lack resource and i think it is probably vulnerable to any calamity that take out earth .,science
the moon is too close it is vulnerable to a calamity that take out earth .,science
i am not saying we shouldnt have a moon base but mar is mar would be far more resilient .,science
the difficulty of getting to mar is what make it resilient .,science
but in going through these various explanation of why do not we see the alien why one of them is that they fail to pas these great filter these key hurdle .,science
and one of those hurdle is being a multiplanet specie .,science
if you are a multiplanet specie then if something would happen whether that wa a natural catastrophe or a manmade catastrophe at least the other planet would probably still be around .,science
you do not have all the egg in one basket .,science
and once you are a twoplanet specie you can obviously extend life half to the asteroid belt to maybe to the moon of jupiter and saturn and ultimately to other star system .,science
but if you can not even get to another planet definitely not getting to star system .,science
and the other possible great filter super powerful technology agi for example .,science
you are trying to knock out one great filter at a time .,science
digital superintelligence is possibly a great filter .,science
i hope it is not but it might be .,science
guy say jeff hinton would say he invented a number of the key principle on artificial intelligence .,science
i think he put the probability of ai annihilation around ten to twenty something that .,science
it is not look on the side it is eighty likely to be great .,science
but i think ai risk mitigation is important .,science
being a multiplanet specie would be a massive risk mitigation .,science
and i do wan na once again emphasize the importance of having enough child to sustain our number and not plummet into population collapse which is currently happening .,science
population collapse is a real and current thing .,science
the only reason it is not being reflected in the total population number is that a much is because people are living longer .,science
but you can it is easy to predict say what the population of any given country will be .,science
you take the birth rate last year how many baby were born multiply that by life expectancy and thats what the population will be steady state unless if the birth rate continues to that level .,science
but if it keep declining it will be even le and eventually dwindle to nothing .,science
i keep banging on the baby drum here for a reason because it ha been the source of civilizational collapse over and over again throughout history .,science
and why do not we not try to stave off that day ?,science
in that way i have miserably failed civilization and i am trying hoping to fix that .,science
i would love to have many kid .,science
no time the present .,science
yeah i got ta allocate more compute to the whole process .,science
but apparently it is not that difficult .,science
no it is unskilled labor .,science
if i one of the thing you do for me for the world is to inspire u with what the future could be .,science
there will be billion of robot .,science
that seems almost that seems virtual certainty .,science
thank you for building the future and thank you for inspiring many of u to keep building and creating cool stuff including kid .,science
yeah welcome .,science
i go forth and multiply .,science
go forth and multiply .,science
thank you elon .,science
thanks for talking brother .,science
thanks for listening to this conversation with elon musk .,science
and now dear friend here dj sa the cofounder president and coo of neuralink .,science
when did you first become fascinated by the human brain ?,science
for me i wa always interested in understanding the purpose of thing and how it wa engineered to serve that purpose whether it is organic or inorganic we were talking earlier about your curtain holder .,science
they serve a clear purpose and they were engineered with that purpose in mind .,science
and growing up i had a lot of interest in seeing thing touching thing feeling thing and trying to understand the root of how it wa designed to serve that purpose .,science
and obviously brain is a fascinating organ that we all carry .,science
it is an infinitely powerful machine that ha intelligence and cognition that arise from it .,science
and we havent even scratched the surface in term of how all of that occurs .,science
but also at the same time i think it took me a while to make that connection to studying and building tech to understand the brain not until graduate school .,science
there were a couple of moment key moment in my life where some of those i think influence how the trajectory of my life got me to studying what i am doing now .,science
one wa growing up both side of my family my grandparent had a very severe form of alzheimer .,science
and it is incredibly debilitating condition .,science
you are seeing someone whole identity and their mind losing over time .,science
and i remember thinking how both the power of the mind but also how something that could lose your sense of identity .,science
it is fascinating that that is one of the way to reveal the power thing by watching it lose the power .,science
yeah a lot of what we know about the brain come from these case where there are trauma to the brain or some part of the brain that let someone to lose certain ability .,science
and a a result there some correlation and understanding of that part of the tissue being critical for that function .,science
and it is an incredibly fragile organ if you think about it that way but also it is incredibly plastic and incredibly resilient in many different way .,science
and by the way the term plastic is well use a bunch mean that it is adaptable .,science
neuroplasticity refers to the adaptability of the human brain .,science
another key moment that influence how the trajectory of my life have shaped towards the current focus of my life ha been during my teenager when i came to the u . and i did not speak a word of english .,science
there wa a huge language barrier and there wa a lot of struggle to connect with my peer around me because i did not understand the artificial construct that we have created called language specifically english in this case .,science
and i remember feeling pretty isolated not being able to connect with peer around me .,science
i spent a lot of time on my own reading book watching movie .,science
and i naturally gravitated towards scifi book .,science
i found them interesting .,science
and also it wa a great way for me to learn english .,science
some of the first set of book that i picked up are enders game the whole saga by orson scott card and neural mansur from william gibson and snow crash from neil stevenson .,science
and movie matrix wa coming out around that time point that influenced how i think about the potential impact that technology can have for our life in general .,science
fast track through my college year i wa always fascinated by physical stuff building physical stuff and especially physical thing that had some intelligence .,science
and i studied electrical engineering during undergrad and i started out my research in mem microelectromechanical system and building these tiny nanostructures for temperature sensing .,science
and i found that to be incredibly rewarding and fascinating subject to understand how you can build something miniature that that again serve a function and had a purpose .,science
and then i spent a large majority of my college year building millimeter wave circuit for next gen telecommunication system for imaging .,science
and it wa something that i found very very intellectually interesting phase array how the signal processing work for any modern a a next gen telecommunication system wireless and wire line .,science
em wave or electromagnetic wave are fascinating .,science
how do you design antenna that are most efficient in a small footprint that you have ?,science
how do you make these thing energy efficient ?,science
that wa something that consumed my intellectual curiosity .,science
and how you would design circuit around that to ultimately go on phone and any other device that are wirelessly connected these day .,science
i wa absolutely fascinated by how that entire system work and that infrastructure work .,science
and then also during grad school i had the fortune of having couple of research fellowship that led me to pursue whatever project that i want .,science
and at the time i wa working on this project called the smart bandaid .,science
and the idea wa that when you get a wound there a lot of other proliferation of signaling pathway that cell follow to close that wound .,science
and there were hypothesis that when you apply external electric field you can accelerate the closing of that field by having electro taxing of the cell around that wound site .,science
and specifically not for normal wound there are chronic wound that do not heal .,science
we were interested in building some a wearable patch that you could apply to facilitate that healing process .,science
and that wa in collaboration with professor michelle harvitz which which wa a great addition to my thesis committee and shaped the rest of my phd career .,science
this would be the first time you interacted with biology i suppose .,science
correct correct .,science
there were some peripheral end application of the wireless imaging and telecommunication system that i wa using for security and bioimaging .,science
but this wa a very clear direct application to biology and biological system and understanding the constraint around that and designing and engineering electrical solution around it .,science
that wa my first introduction .,science
and thats also how i got introduced to michelle .,science
he known for remote control of beetle in the early 2000s .,science
and then around two thousand and thirteen obviously the holy grail when it come to implantable system is to understand how small of a thing you can make .,science
and a lot of that is driven by how much energy or how much power you can supply to it and how you extract data from it .,science
at the time at berkeley there wa this this desire to understand in the neural space what system you can build to miniaturize these implantable system .,science
and i distinctively remember this one particular meeting where michelle came in and he guy i think i have a solution .,science
the solution is ultrasound .,science
and then he proceeded to walk through why that is the case .,science
and that formed the basis for my thesis work called neural dust system that wa looking at way to use ultrasound a opposed to electromagnetic wave for powering a a communication .,science
and a i mentioned the size of the implantable system is limited by how you power the thing and get the data off of it .,science
and at the end of the day fundamentally if you look at a human body we are essentially a bag of saltwater with some interesting protein and chemical but it is mostly saltwater thats very very temperature regulated at thirty seven degree celsius .,science
and well get into how why and later why thats an extremely harsh environment for any electronics to survive a i am sure youve experienced or maybe not experienced dropping cell phone in a saltwater in an ocean it will instantly kill the device ?,science
but anyways in general electromagnetic wave do not penetrate through this environment .,science
and the speed of light it is what it is we can not change it .,science
and based on the wavelength at which you are interfacing with the device the device need to be big these inductor need to be quite big .,science
and the general good rule of thumb is that you want the wave front to be roughly on the order of the size of the thing that you are interfacing with .,science
an implantable system that is around ten to one hundred micron in dimension in a volume which is about the size of a neuron that in a human body .,science
you would have to operate at hundred of gigahertz which number one not only is it difficult to build electronics operating at those frequency but also the body attenuates that very very significantly .,science
the interesting insight of this ultrasound wa the fact that ultrasound travel a lot more effectively in the human body tissue compared to electromagnetic wave .,science
and this is something that you encounter and i am sure most people have encountered in their life when you go to hospital that are medical ultrasound sonograph ?,science
and they go into very very deep depth without attenuating too much of the signal .,science
all in all ultrasound the fact that it travel through the body extremely and the mechanism to which it travel to the body is that the wave front is very different .,science
it is electromagnetic wave are transverse whereas in ultrasound wave are compressive .,science
it is a completely different mode of wave front propagation .,science
and a a speed of sound is order and order of magnitude le than speed of light which mean that even at ten megahertz well sound wave your wave front ultimately is a very very small wavelength .,science
if you are talking about interfacing with the ten micron or one hundred micron type structure you would have one hundred and fifty micron wave front at ten megahertz and building electronics at those frequency are much much easier and they are a lot more efficient .,science
the basic idea wa born out of using ultrasound a a mechanism for powering the device and then also getting data back .,science
now the question is how do you get the data back ?,science
the mechanism to which we landed on is whats called backscattering .,science
this is something that is very common and that we interface on a daytoday basis with our rfid card a radio frequency id tag where there rarely in your id a battery inside .,science
there an antenna and there some coil that ha your serial identification id .,science
and then there an external device called a reader that then sends a wave front and then you reflect back that wave front with some modulation thats unique to your id .,science
thats whats called backscattering fundamentally .,science
the tag itself doesnt have to consume that much energy .,science
and that wa the mechanism to which we were thinking about sending the data back .,science
when you have an external ultrasonic transducer thats sending ultrasonic wave to your implant the neural dust implant and it record some information about it environment whether it is a neuron firing or some other state of the tissue that it is interfacing with .,science
and then it amplitude modulates the wave front that come back to the source .,science
and the recording step would be the only one that requires any energy .,science
what would require energy in that little step ?,science
it is that initial startup circuitry to get that recording amplifying it and then modulating .,science
and the mechanism to which that you can enable that is there is this specialized crystal called piezoelectric crystal that are able to convert sound energy into electrical energy and vice versa .,science
you can have this interplay between the ultrasonic domain and electrical domain that is the biological tissue .,science
on the theme of parking very small computational device next to neuron thats the dream the vision of braincomputer interface .,science
maybe before we talk about neural ink can you give a sense of the history of the field of bci ?,science
what ha been maybe the continued dream and also some of the milestone along the way of the different approach and the amazing work done at the various lab ?,science
i think a good starting point is going back to 1790s .,science
did not expect that .,science
fast forward many many year to 1920s where han berger who a german psychiatrist discovered eeg or electroencephalography which is still around .,science
there are these electrode array that you wear outside the skull that give you some neural recording that wa a very very big milestone that you can record some activity about the human mind .,science
and then in the 1940s there were these group of scientist renshaw forbes and morrison that inserted these glass microelectrodes into the cortex and recorded single neuron .,science
the fact that there signal that are a bit more high resolution and high fidelity a you get closer to the source let say .,science
and in the 1950s these two scientist hodgkin and hoxley showed up and they built this beautiful beautiful model of the cell membrane and the ionic mechanism and had these circuit diagram .,science
and a someone who an electrical engineer it is a beautiful model thats built out of these partial differential equation talking about flow of ion and how that lead to how neuron communicate .,science
and they won the nobel prize for that ten year later in the 1960s .,science
i would say this is the very very first example a far a i am aware of close loop brain computer interface or bci .,science
the abstract read the activity of single neuron in precentral cortex of anesthetized monkey wa conditioned by reinforcing high rate of neuronal discharge or delivery of a food pot .,science
auditorial and visual feedback of unit firing rate wa usually provided in addition to food reinforcement .,science
they got it done .,science
they got it done .,science
this is back in one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine .,science
after several training session monkey could increase the activity of newly isolated cell by fifty to five hundred above rate before reinforcement .,science
brain is very plastic .,science
and from here the number of experiment grew .,science
yeah number of experiment a a set of tool to interface with the brain have exploded .,science
i think and also understanding the neural code and how some of the cortical layer and the function are organized .,science
the other paper that is pretty seminal especially in the motor decoding wa this paper in the 1980s from georgia opolis that discovered that there this thing called motor tuning curve .,science
what are motor tuning curve ?,science
it is the fact that there are neuron in the motor cortex of mammal including human that have a preferential direction that cause them to fire .,science
what that mean is there are a set of neuron that would increase their spiking activity when you are thinking about moving to the left up down and any of those vector .,science
and based on that you could start to think if you can not identify those essential eigenvectors you can do a lot .,science
and you can use that information for decoding someone intended movement from the cortex .,science
that wa a very very seminal paper that showed that there is some code that you can extract especially in the motor cortex .,science
there signal there .,science
and if you measure the electrical signal from the brain that you could figure out what the intention wa .,science
correct yeah not only electrical signal but electrical signal from the set of neuron that give you these preferential direction .,science
going slowly towards neural link one interesting question is what do i understand on the bci front on invasive versus noninvasive ?,science
from this line of work how important is it to park next to the neuron ?,science
what doe that get you ?,science
that answer fundamentally depends on what you want to do with it ?,science
there incredible amount of stuff that you can do with eeg and electrocortigraph ecog which doesnt penetrate the cortical layer or a parankama but you place a set of electrode on the surface of the brain .,science
the thing that i am personally very interested in is understanding and being able to tap into the high resolution high fidelity understanding of the activity that are happening at the local level .,science
and we can get into biophysics but to step back to use analogy because analogy here can be useful .,science
sometimes it is a little bit difficult to think about electricity .,science
at the end of the day we are doing electrical recording thats mediated by ionic current movement of these charged particle which is hard for most people to think about .,science
but turn out a lot of the activity that are happening in the brain and the frequency band with which thats happening is very very similar to sound wave and in our normal conversation audible range .,science
but you have absolutely no idea what the score is .,science
you have absolutely no idea what individual audience or the player are talking or saying to each other what the next play is what the next goal is .,science
what you have to do is you have to drop the microphone into the stadium and then get near the source into the individual chatter .,science
in this specific example you would wan na have it next to where the huddle happening .,science
i think thats a good illustration of what we are trying to do when we say invasive or minimally invasive or implanted brain computer interface versus noninvasive or nonimplanted brain interface .,science
it is talking about where do you put that microphone and what can you do with that information ?,science
what is the biophysics of the read and write communication that we are talking about here a we now step into the effort at neuralink ?,science
yeah brain is made up of these specialized cell called neuron there billion of them ten of billion .,science
sometimes people go at a hundred billion that are connected in this complex yet dynamic network that are constantly remodeling .,science
they are changing their synaptic weight and thats what we typically call neuroplasticity .,science
and the neuron are also bathed in this charged environment that is laden with many charged molecule potassium ion sodium ion chlorine ion .,science
and those facilitate these through ionic current communication between these different network .,science
and when you look at a neuron a they have these membrane with a beautiful beautiful protein structure called a voltage selective ion channel which in my opinion is one of nature best invention .,science
in many way if you think about what they are they are doing the job of a modern day transistor .,science
transistor are nothing more at the end of the day than a voltage gated conduction channel .,science
and nature found a way to have that very very early on in it evolution .,science
and a we all know with the transistor you can have many many computation and a lot of amazing thing that we have access to today .,science
i think it is one of those a a tangent a beautiful beautiful invention that the nature came up with these voltage gated ion channel .,science
i suppose there on the biological level at every level of the complexity of the hierarchy of the organism there going to be some mechanism for storing information and for doing computation .,science
and this is one such way .,science
but to do that with biological and chemical component is interesting .,science
plus when neuron it is not electricity it is chemical communication it is also mechanical .,science
these are actual object that have that vibrate .,science
they move .,science
yeah there are there a lot of interesting physic that are involved in going back to my work on ultrasound during grad school .,science
there are group and there were group and there are still group looking at way to cause neuron to fire an action potential using ultrasound wave .,science
and the mechanism to which thats happening is still unclear a i understand .,science
it may be that you are imparting some thermal energy and that cause cell to depolarize in some interesting way .,science
but there are also these ion channel or even membrane that open up a poor a they are being mechanically shook vibrated .,science
there a lot of element of these move particle which again thats governed by diffusion physic ?,science
movement of particle .,science
and there also a lot of interesting physic there .,science
also not to mention a roger penrose talk about there might be some beautiful weirdness in the quantum mechanical effect of all of this .,science
and he belief that consciousness might emerge from the quantum mechanical effect there .,science
there physic there chemistry there bio all of that is going on there .,science
yeah yeah you can yes there a lot of level of physic that you can dive into .,science
but yeah in the end you have these membrane with these voltage gated ion channel that selectively let these charged molecule that are in the extracellular matrix in and out .,science
and these neuron generally have these resting potential where there a voltage difference between inside the cell and outside the cell .,science
and when there some stimulus that change the state such that they need to send information to the downstream network you start to see these orchestration of these different molecule going in and out of these channel .,science
they also open up more of them open up once it reach some threshold to a point where you have a depolarizing cell that sends an action potential .,science
it is a very beautiful orchestration of these molecule .,science
and what we are trying to do when we place an electrode or parking it next to a neuron is that you are trying to measure these local change in the potential .,science
again mediated by the movement of the ion .,science
and whats interesting a i mentioned earlier there a lot of physic involved .,science
and the two dominant physic for this electrical recording domain is diffusion physic and electromagnetism .,science
and where one dominates where maxwell equation dominates versus fixed law dominates depends on where your electrode is .,science
if it is close to the source mostly electromagnetic based when you are farther away from it it is more diffusion based .,science
essentially when you are able to park it next to it you can listen in on those individual chatter and those local change in the potential .,science
and the type of signal that you get are these canonical textbook neural spiking waveform .,science
you are no longer able to have the system sensitive enough to be able to record that particular local membrane potential change in that neuron .,science
and to give you a sense of scale also when you look at one hundred micron voxels one hundred micron by one hundred micron by one hundred micron box in a brain tissue there roughly around forty neuron and whatever number of connection that they have .,science
there a lot in that volume of tissue .,science
the moment you are outside of that there no hope that youll be able to detect that change from that one specific neuron that you may care about .,science
yeah but a you are moving about this space youll be hearing other one .,science
if you move another one hundred micron youll be hearing chatter from another community .,science
and the whole sense is you wan na place a many a possible electrode and then you are listening to the chatter .,science
yeah you wan na listen to the chatter and at the end of the day you also want to let the software do the job of decoding .,science
and to go to why ecog and eeg work at all ?,science
when you have these local change obviously it is not this one neuron thats activating there many many other network that are activating all the time .,science
and you do see a general change in the potential of this electrode this is charge medium .,science
and thats what you are recording when you are farther away .,science
you still have some reference electrode thats stable and the brain thats electroactive organ .,science
and you are seeing some combination aggregate action potential change .,science
and then you can pick it up ?,science
it is a much slower changing signal but there are these canonical oscillation and wave gamma wave beta wave when you sleep that can be detected because there a synchronized global global effect of the brain that you can detect .,science
and the physic of this go if we want to go down that rabbit hole there a lot that go on in term of why diffusion physic at some point dominates when you are further away from the source .,science
it is a charge medium .,science
similar to how when you have electromagnetic wave propagating in atmosphere or in a charge medium a plasma there this weird shielding that happens that further attenuates the signal .,science
a you move away from it .,science
yeah if you do a deep dive on the signal attenuation over distance you start to see one over r square in the beginning and then exponential drop off .,science
and thats the knee at which you go from electromagnetism dominating to diffusion physic dominating .,science
but once again with the electrode the biophysics that you need to understand is not a deep because no matter what you are placing that you are listening to a small crowd of local neuron .,science
once you penetrate the brain you are in the arena to speak .,science
and there a lot of neuron .,science
there are many many of them .,science
but then again there there a whole field of neuroscience thats studying how the different grouping the different section of the seating in the arena what they usually are responsible for which is where the metaphor probably fall apart .,science
because the seating is not that organized in an arena .,science
also most of them are silent .,science
they do not do much or their activity are you have to hit it with the set of stimulus .,science
they are usually quiet .,science
they are usually very quiet .,science
there similar to dark energy and dark matter there dark neuron .,science
what are they all doing ?,science
when you place these electrode again within this hundred micron volume you have forty or neuron .,science
why do you not see forty neuron ?,science
what is happening there ?,science
they are mostly quiet but when they speak they say profound shit i think .,science
thats the way id to think about it .,science
anyway before we zoom in even more let zoom out .,science
from the surgery to the implant to the signal and the decoding process and the human being able to use the implant to affect the world outside .,science
and all of this i am asking in the context of there a gigantic historic milestone that neuralink accomplished that in january of this year putting in neuralink implant in the first human being nolan .,science
and there been a lot to talk about there about his experience because he able to describe all the nuance and the beauty and the fascinating complexity of that experience of everything involved .,science
but on the technical level how doe neuralink work ?,science
yeah there are three major component to the technology that we are building .,science
one is the device the thing thats recording these neural chatter .,science
we call it n1 implant or the link .,science
and we have a surgical robot thats doing an implantation of these tiny tiny wire that we call thread that are smaller than human hair .,science
and once everything is surgery you have these neural signal these spiking neuron that are coming out of the brain .,science
and you need to have some software to decode what the user intend to do with that .,science
there whats called neuralink application or b1 app thats doing that translation .,science
it is running the very very simple machine learning model that decodes these input that are neural signal and then converted to a set of output that allows our participant first participant nolan to be able to control a cursor .,science
and this is done wirelessly .,science
and this is done wirelessly .,science
our implant is a twopart .,science
this link ha these flexible tiny wire called thread that have multiple electrode along it length .,science
and they are only inserted into the cortical layer which is about three to five millimeter in a human brain .,science
in the motor cortex region thats where the intention for movement lie in .,science
and we have sixty four of these thread each thread having sixteen electrode along the span of three to four millimeter separated by two hundred micron .,science
you can record along the depth of the insertion .,science
and based on that signal there custom integrated circuit or asic that we built that amplifies the neural signal that you are recording and then digitizing it .,science
and then ha some mechanism for detecting whether there wa an interesting event that is a spiking event and decide to send that or not send that through bluetooth to an external device whether it is a phone or a computer thats running this neural link application .,science
there onboard signal processing already to decide whether this is an interesting event or not .,science
there is some computational power on board inside in addition to the human brain .,science
yeah it doe the signal processing to compress the amount of signal that you are recording .,science
we have a total of one thousand electrode sampling at under twenty kilohertz with ten bit each .,science
thats two hundred megabit thats coming through to the chip from one thousand channel simultaneous neural recording .,science
and thats quite a bit of data .,science
and there are technology available to send that off wirelessly but being able to do that in a very very thermally constrained environment that is a brain .,science
there ha to be some amount of compression that happens to send off only the interesting data that you need which in this particular case for motor decoding is occurrence of a spike or not .,science
and then being able to use that to decode the intended cursor movement .,science
all of this is fascinating but let stick on the end one implant itself .,science
the thing thats in the brain i am looking at a picture of it there an enclosure there a charging coil we did not talk about the charging which is fascinating .,science
the battery the power electronics the antenna then there the signal processing electronics .,science
i wonder if there more kind of signal processing you can do it thats another question .,science
and then there the thread themselves with the enclosure on the bottom .,science
maybe to ask about the charging .,science
there an external charging device .,science
yeah there an external charging device .,science
yeah the second part of the implant the thread are the one again the last three to five millimeter are the one that are penetrating the cortex .,science
rest of it is most of the volume is occupied by the battery rechargeable battery .,science
and it is about a size of a quarter .,science
i have a device here if you wan na take a look at it .,science
this is the flexible thread component of it and then this is the implant .,science
it is about a size of a u quarter it is about nine millimeter thick .,science
this implant once you have the craniectomy and the directomy thread are inserted .,science
and the hole that you created this craniectomy get replaced with that .,science
that thing plug that hole and you can screw in these selfdrilling cranial screw to hold it in place .,science
and at the end of the day once you have the skin flap over there only about two to three millimeter thats obviously transitioning off of the top of the implant to where the screw are .,science
and thats the minor bump that you have .,science
those thread look tiny .,science
thats incredible .,science
that is incredible .,science
that is incredible .,science
and also a you are most of the actual volume is the battery .,science
this is way smaller than i realized .,science
they are also the thread themselves are quite strong .,science
they look strong .,science
and the thread themselves also ha a very interesting feature at the end of it called the loop .,science
and thats the mechanism to which the robot is able to interface and manipulate this tiny hair structure .,science
and they are tiny .,science
whats the width of the thread ?,science
yeah the width of a thread start from sixteen micron and then taper out to about eighty four micron .,science
average human hair is about eighty to one hundred micron in width .,science
this thing is amazing .,science
this thing is amazing .,science
yes most of the volume is occupied by the battery .,science
rechargeable lithium ion cell .,science
and the charging is done through inductive charging which is very commonly used .,science
most cell phone have that .,science
the biggest difference is that for u usually when you have a phone and you wan na charge it on a charging pad you do not care how hot it get .,science
whereas for u it matter .,science
there a very strict regulation and good reason to not increase the surrounding tissue temperature by two degree celsius .,science
there a lot of innovation that is packed into this to allow charging of this implant without causing that temperature threshold to reach .,science
and even small thing this charging coil and whats called a ferrite shield ?,science
without that ferrite shield what you end up having when you have resonant inductive charging is that the battery itself is a metallic can and you form these eddy current from the external charger and that cause heating .,science
and that contributes to inefficiency in charging .,science
this ferrite shield what it doe is that it concentrate that field line away from the battery and then around the coil thats wrapped around it .,science
there a lot of fascinating design here to make it you are integrating a computer into a biological a complex biological system .,science
yeah there a lot of innovation here .,science
i would say that part of what enabled this wa the innovation in the wearable .,science
there a lot of powerful tiny low power microcontrollers temperature sensor or various different sensor and power electronics .,science
a lot of innovation came in the charging coil design how this is packaged and how do you enable charging such that you do not exceed that temperature limit which is not a constraint for other device out there .,science
let talk about the thread themselves those tiny tiny tiny thing .,science
how many of them are there ?,science
you mentioned a thousand electrode .,science
how many thread are there ?,science
what did the electrode have to do with the thread ?,science
yeah the current instantiation of the device ha sixty four thread and each thread ha sixteen electrode for a total of onetwenty four electrode that are capable of both recording and stimulating .,science
and the thread is this polymer insulated wire .,science
the metal conductor is the a tiramisu cake of thai gold plat thai .,science
and they are very very tiny wire two micron in width two one millionth of meter .,science
it is crazy that that thing i am looking at ha the polymer insulation ha the conducting material and ha sixteen electrode at the end of it .,science
on each of those thread ?,science
yeah on each of those thread .,science
sixteen each one of those .,science
yes you are not gon na be able to see it with naked eye .,science
and to state the obvious or maybe for people who are listening they are flexible .,science
yes yes thats also one element that wa incredibly important for u . each of these thread are a i mentioned sixteen micron in width and then they taper to eighty four micron but in thickness they are le than five micron .,science
and in thickness is mostly polyimid at the bottom and this metal track and then another polyimid .,science
two micron of polyimid four hundred nanometer of this metal stack and two micron of polyimid sandwich together to protect it from the environment that is thirty seven degree c bag of salt water .,science
whats some maybe can you speak to some interesting aspect of the material design here ?,science
what doe it take to design a thing this and to be able to manufacture a thing this for people who do not know anything about this thing ?,science
yeah the material selection that we have is not i do not think it wa particularly unique .,science
there were other lab and there are other lab that are looking at similar material stack .,science
and thats been the innovation from richard norman back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven .,science
it is called the utah ray because he wa at university of utah .,science
and what doe the utah ray look ?,science
it is a rigid type of .,science
yeah we can look it up .,science
yeah it is a bit of needle .,science
there ... good .,science
and the size and the number of shank vary anywhere from sixty four to one hundred and twenty eight .,science
at the very tip of it is an exposed electrode that record neural signal .,science
the other thing thats interesting to note is that unlike neural link thread that have recording electrode that are exposed iridium oxide recording site along the depth this is only at a single depth .,science
these utah ray spoke can be anywhere between zero.five millimeter to one.five millimeter .,science
and they also have design that are slanted you can have it inserted at different depth .,science
but thats one of the other big difference .,science
and then the main key difference is the fact that there no active electronics .,science
these are electrode .,science
and then there a bundle of a wire that you are seeing .,science
and then that then exists the craniactomy that then ha this port that you can connect to for any external electronic device .,science
they are working on or have the wireless telemetry device but it still requires through the skin port that is one of the biggest failure mode for infection for the system .,science
what are some of the challenge associated with flexible thread ?,science
for example on the robotic side r1 implanting those thread how difficult doe that task ?,science
yeah a you mentioned they are very very difficult to maneuver by hand .,science
these utah ray that you saw earlier they are inserted by a neurosurgeon positioning it near the site that they want .,science
and then there a pneumatic hammer that push them in .,science
it is a pretty simple process and they are easier to maneuver .,science
but for these thin foam array they are very very tiny and flexible they are very difficult to maneuver .,science
thats why we built an entire robot to do that .,science
there are other reason for why we built a robot .,science
and that is ultimately we want this to help million and million of people that can benefit from this and there are not that many neurosurgeon out there .,science
and robot can be something that we hope can do large part of the surgery .,science
but the robot is this entire other category of product that we are working on .,science
and it is essentially this multiaxis gantry system that ha the specialized robot head that ha all of the optic and this a needle retracting mechanism that maneuver these thread via this loop structure that you have on the thread .,science
the thread already ha a loop structure by which you can grab it .,science
this is fascinating .,science
you mentioned optic .,science
there a robot r1 .,science
for now there a human that creates a hole in this scope .,science
and then after that there a computer vision component thats finding a way to avoid the blood vessel .,science
and then you are grabbing it by the loop each individual thread and placing it in a particular location to avoid the blood vessel .,science
and also choosing the depth of placement all that .,science
controlling every the 3d geometry of the placement .,science
the aspect of this robot that is unique is that it is not surgeon assisted or human assisted .,science
it is a semiautomatic or automatic robot .,science
obviously there are human component to it when you are placing target .,science
you can always move it away from major vessel that .,science
but we wan na get to a point where one click and it doe the surgery within minute .,science
the computer vision component find great target candidate and the human approves them .,science
and the robot doe it do one thread at a time ?,science
it doe one thread at a time .,science
and thats also one thing that we are looking at way to do multiple thread at a time .,science
there nothing stopping from it .,science
but now it is one by one .,science
and we also still do quite a bit of verification to make sure that it got inserted .,science
if how deep did it match what wa programmed in and on and forth ?,science
and the actual electrode is a place at different depth in the it is very small difference but difference .,science
and that there some reasoning behind that a you mentioned it get more varied signal .,science
yeah we try to place them all around three or four millimeter from the surface .,science
cause the span of the electrode those sixteen electrode that we currently have in this version span roughly around three millimeter .,science
we wan na get all of those in the brain .,science
this is fascinating .,science
there a million question here .,science
if we go zoom in specifically on the electrode what is your sense how many neuron is each individual electrode listening to ?,science
yeah each electrode can record from anywhere between zero to forty a i mentioned earlier .,science
but practically speaking we only see about at most two to three .,science
and you can distinguish which neuron it is coming from by the shape of the spike .,science
i mentioned the spike detection algorithm that we have .,science
it is called the bos algorithm buffer online spike sorter .,science
it output at the end of the day six unique value which are the amplitude of these negative going hump middle hump positive going hump and then also the time at which these happen .,science
and from that you can have a a statistical probability estimation of is that a spike is it not a spike ?,science
and then based on that you could also determine that spike look different than that spike must come from a different neuron .,science
thats a nice signal processing step from which you can then make much better prediction about if there a spike especially in this context where there could be multiple neuron screaming .,science
and that also result in you being able to compress the data better in the center of the day .,science
thats ... and to be clear the lab do this whats called spike sorting .,science
usually once you have these broadband the fully digitized signal and then you run a bunch of different set of algorithm to tease apart it is all of this for u is done on the device .,science
on the device .,science
in a very low power custom built asic digital processing unit .,science
highly heat constrained .,science
highly heat constrained .,science
and the processing time from signal going in and giving you the output is le than a microsecond which is a very very short amount of time .,science
yeah the latency ha to be super short .,science
thats a pain in the as .,science
yeah latency is this huge huge thing that you have to deal with .,science
now the biggest source of latency come from the bluetooth .,science
the way in which they are packetized .,science
and we bend them in fifteen millisecond .,science
it is communication constrained .,science
is there some potential innovation there on the protocol used ?,science
absolutely. . bluetooth is definitely not our final wireless communication protocol that we want to get to .,science
it is a high hence the n1 and the r1 .,science
i imagine that increase .,science
yeah thats the communication protocol because bluetooth allows you to communicate against farther distance than you need to .,science
you can go much shorter .,science
yeah the only the primary motivation for choosing bluetooth is that everything ha bluetooth .,science
all you can talk to any device .,science
interoperability is absolutely essential especially in this early phase .,science
and in many way if you can access a phone or a computer you can do anything .,science
itd be interesting to step back and look at again the same pipeline that you mentioned for nolan .,science
what doe this whole process look from finding and selecting a human being to the surgery to the first time he able to use this thing ?,science
we have whats called a patient registry that people can sign up to hear more about the update .,science
and that wa a route to which nolan applied .,science
and the process is that once the application come in it contains some medical record .,science
and we based on their medical eligibility that there a lot of different inclusion and exclusion criterion for them to meet .,science
and we go through a prescreening interview process with someone from their link .,science
and at some point we also go out to their home to do a bci home audit .,science
because one of the most revolutionary part about having this and one system that is completely wireless is that you can use it at home .,science
you do not have to go to the lab and go to the clinic to get connected to these specialized equipment that you can not take home with you .,science
thats one of the key element of when we are designing the system that we wanted to keep in mind people hopefully would want to be able to use this every day in the comfort of their home .,science
and part of our engagement and what we are looking for during bci home audit is to understand their situation what other assistive technology that they use .,science
and we should also step back and say that the estimate is one hundred and eightyzero people live with quadriplegia in the united state .,science
and each year an additional eighteenzero suffer a paralyzing spinal cord injury .,science
these are folk who have a lot of challenge living a life in term of accessibility .,science
in term of doing the thing that many of u take for granted day to day .,science
and one of the thing one of the goal of this initial study is to enable them to have digital autonomy where they by themselves can interact with a digital device using their mind something that you are calling telepathy .,science
digital telepathy where quadriplegia can communicate with a digital device in all the way that weve been talking about .,science
control the mouse cursor enough to be able to do all kind of stuff including play game and tweet and all that stuff .,science
and there a lot of people for whom life the basic of life are difficult because of the thing that have happened to them. . yeah movement is fundamental to our existence .,science
even speaking involves movement of mouth lip larynx .,science
and without that it is extremely debilitating .,science
and there are many many people that we can help .,science
and especially if you start to look at other form of movement disorder that are not from spinal cord injury but from al m or even stroke that lead you in order to aging ?,science
that lead you to lose some of that mobility that independence it is extremely debilitating .,science
and all of these are opportunity to help people to help alleviate suffering to help improve the quality of life .,science
but each of the thing you mentioned is it own little puzzle .,science
then you have increasing level of capability from a device a new orleans device .,science
and the first one you are focusing on is it is the beautiful word telepathy .,science
being able to communicate using your mind wirelessly with a digital device .,science
can you explain this exactly what we are talking about ?,science
yeah it is exactly that .,science
i think if you are able to control a cursor and able to click and be able to get access to computer or phone the whole world open up to you .,science
and i guess the word telepathy if you think about that a definitionally being able to transfer information from my brain to your brain without using some of the physical faculty that we have voice .,science
but the interesting thing here is i think the thing thats not obviously clear is how exactly it work .,science
in order to move a cursor there at least a couple of way of doing that .,science
one is you imagine yourself maybe moving a mouse with your hand or you can then which no one talked about imagine moving the cursor with your mind .,science
but it is there is a cognitive step here thats fascinating because you have to use the brain and you have to learn how to use the brain .,science
and you have to figure it out dynamically because you reward yourself if it work .,science
you there a step that this is it is a fascinating step because you have to get the brain to start firing in the way .,science
and you do that by imagining fake it till you make it .,science
and all of a sudden it creates the signal that if decoded correctly can create the effect .,science
and then there noise around that you have to figure all of that out .,science
but on the human side imagine the cursor moving is what you have to do .,science
yeah he say using the force .,science
of course .,science
thats is not that fascinating to you that it work ?,science
to me it is holy shit that work .,science
you could move a cursor with your mind .,science
a much a you are learning to use that thing that thing also learning about you our model is constantly updating the weight to say if someone is thinking about this sophisticated form of spiking pattern that mean to do this ?,science
the machine is learning about the human and the human is learning about the machine .,science
there is adaptability to the signal processing the decoding step .,science
and then there the adaptation of knowing the human being .,science
the same way if you give me a new mouse and i move it i learn very quickly about it sensitivity ill learn to move it slower .,science
and then there other kind of signal drift and all that stuff they have to adapt to .,science
both are adapting to each other .,science
thats a fascinating software challenge on both side the software on both on the human software and the the organic and the inorganic .,science
the organic and the inorganic .,science
anyway i had to rudely interrupt .,science
there the selection that nolan ha passed with flying color .,science
everything including that it is a bci friendly home all of that .,science
what is the process of the surgery and plantation the first moment when he get to use the system ?,science
the end to end we say patient in to patient out is anywhere between two to four hour .,science
in particular case for nolan it wa about three and a half hour and there many step leading to the actual robot insertion ?,science
there anesthesia induction and we do intra op ct imaging to make sure that we are drilling the hole in the location .,science
and this is also preplanned beforehand .,science
someone go through someone nolan would go through fmri and then they can think about wiggling their hand .,science
obviously due to their injury it is not gon na lead to any intended output .,science
but it is the same part of the brain that light up when you are imagining moving your finger to moving your finger .,science
and thats one of the way in which we can know where to place our thread .,science
cause we wan na go into whats called a hand knob area in the motor cortex and a much a possible densely put our electrode thread .,science
yeah we do intra op ct imaging to make sure and double check the location of the craniectomy .,science
and surgeon come in doe their thing in term of skin incision craniectomy drilling of the skull .,science
and then there many different layer of the brain .,science
there whats called a dura which is a very very thick layer that surround the brain .,science
that get resected in a process called directomy .,science
and that then exposed the pia in the brain that you wan na insert .,science
and by the time it is been around anywhere between one to one and a half hour robot come in doe his thing placement of the target inserting of the thread .,science
that take anywhere between twenty to forty minute in the particular case for nolan it wa under or over thirty minute .,science
and then after that the surgeon come in there a couple other step of inserting the dural substitute layer to protect the thread a a the brain .,science
and then screw in the implant and then skin flap and then suture and then you are out .,science
when nolan woke up what wa that ?,science
wa the recovery ?,science
and what wa the first time he wa able to use it ?,science
he wa immediately after the surgery an hour after the surgery a he wa waking up we did turn on the device make sure that we are recording neural signal .,science
and we did have a couple of signal that we noticed that he can modulate .,science
and what by modulate is that he can think about crunching his fist and you could see the spike disappear and appear .,science
and thats awesome .,science
and that wa immediate ?,science
immediate after in the recovery room .,science
how cool wa that ?,science
yeah thats a human being .,science
what did that feel for you ?,science
this device in a human being a first step of a gigantic journey .,science
it is a historic moment even that spike to be able to modulate that .,science
obviously there had been other a you mentioned pioneer that have participated in these groundbreaking bci investigational early feasibility study .,science
we are obviously standing in the shoulder of the giant here we are not the first one to put electrode in the human brain .,science
but leading up to the surgery there wa i definitely could not sleep .,science
there it is the first time that you are working in a completely new environment .,science
we brought something forty needle in case they break and we ended up using only one .,science
but that wa a level of complete unknown because it is a very very different environment .,science
and thats why we do clinical trial in the first place to be able to test these thing out .,science
extreme nervousness and many many sleepless night leading up to the surgery and definitely the day before the surgery and it wa an early morning surgery .,science
we started at seven in the morning and by the time it wa around ten thirty it wa everything wa done .,science
but first time seeing that number one huge relief that this thing is doing what it is supposed to do .,science
and two immense amount of gratitude for nolan and his family .,science
and then many others that have applied and that weve spoken to and will speak to are true pioneer in every war .,science
and i call them the neural astronaut or neural knot .,science
and you are not yet .,science
these amazing in the sixty ?,science
these amazing pioneer ?,science
exploring the unknown outwards in this case is inward .,science
but an incredible amount of gratitude for them to participate and play a part .,science
and it is a journey that we are embarking on together .,science
but also i think it wa that wa a very very important milestone but our work wa starting .,science
a lot of anticipation for what need to happen next ?,science
what are set of sequence of event that need to happen for u to make it worthwhile for both nolan a a u . to linger on that a huge congratulation to you and the team for that milestone .,science
i know there a lot of work left but that is thats exciting to see .,science
there thats a source of hope .,science
it is this first big step opportunity to help hundred of thousand of people and then maybe expand the realm of the possible for the human mind for million of people in the future .,science
it is exciting .,science
the opportunity are all ahead of u and to do that safely and to do that effectively wa fun to see .,science
a an engineer watching other engineer come together and do an epic thing that wa awesome .,science
huge congrats .,science
thank you thank you .,science
it is yeah could not have done it without the team .,science
and yeah thats the other thing that i i told the team a of this immense sense of optimism for the future .,science
it wa a it is a very important moment for the company needle to say a a hopefully for many others out there that we can help .,science
speaking of challenge the neuralink published a blog post describing that some of the thread are attracted .,science
and the performance a measured by bit per second dropped at first but then eventually it wa regained .,science
and that the whole story of how it wa regained is super interesting .,science
thats definitely something ill talk to to bliss and to nolan about but in general can you speak to this whole experience ?,science
how wa the performance regained ?,science
and the technical aspect of the thread being attracted and moving .,science
the main takeaway is that in the end the performance have come back and it is gotten better than it wa before .,science
he beat the world record yet again last week to eight.five bps .,science
he cranking and he improving .,science
the previous one wa that he said wa eight .,science
he said eight.five .,science
yeah the previous world record in human wa four.six .,science
it is almost double .,science
and his goal is to try to get to ten which is roughly around the median neuralinkr using a mouse with the hand .,science
it is getting there .,science
yeah the performance wa regained .,science
yeah better than before .,science
thats a story on it own of what took the bci team to recover that performance .,science
it wa mostly on the signal processing .,science
and a i mentioned we were looking at these spike output from the our electrode .,science
and what happened is that four week into the surgery we noticed that the thread have slowly come out of the brain .,science
and the way in which we noticed this at first obviously is that i think nolan wa the first to notice that his performance wa degrading .,science
and i think at the time we were also trying to do a bunch of different experimentation different algorithm different ui ux .,science
it wa expected that there will be variability in the performance but we did see a steady decline .,science
and then also the way in which we measure the health of the electrode or whether they are in the brain or not is by measuring impedance of the electrode .,science
we look at the interfacial the randall circuit let say they say the capacitance and the resistance between the electro surface and the medium .,science
and if that change in some dramatic way we have some indication or if you are not seeing spike on those channel you have some indication that somethings happening there .,science
and what we noticed is that looking at those impedance plot and spike rate plot and also because we have those electrode recording along the depth you are seeing some movement that indicated that the reservoir being pulled out .,science
and that obviously will have an implication on the model side because if you are the number of input that are going into the model is changing because you have le of them that model need to get updated ?,science
and but there were still signal .,science
and a i mentioned similar to how even when you place the signal on the surface of the brain or farther away outside the skull you still see some useful signal .,science
what we started looking at is not the spike occurrence through this bos algorithm that i mentioned but we started looking at the power of the frequency band that is interesting for nolan to be able to modulate .,science
once we change the algorithm for the implant to not give you the bos output but also these spike band power output that helped u be find the model with the new set of input .,science
and that wa the thing that ultimately gave u the performance back .,science
in term of and obviously the thing that we want ultimately and the thing that we are working towards is figuring out way in which we can keep those thread intact .,science
for a long a possible that we have many more channel going into the model .,science
thats by far the number one priority that the team is currently embarking on to understand how to prevent that from happening .,science
the thing that i will say also is that a i mentioned this is the first time ever that we are putting these thread in a human brain .,science
and human brain for size reference is ten time that of the monkey brain or the sheep brain .,science
and it is a very very different environment .,science
it move a lot more .,science
it is moved a lot more than we expected when we did nolans surgery .,science
and it is a very very different environment than what we are used to .,science
and this is why we do clinical trial .,science
we want to uncover some of these issue and failure mode earlier than later .,science
in many way it is provided u with this enormous amount of data and information to be able to solve this .,science
and this is something that new orleans is extremely good at .,science
once we have set up clear objective and engineering problem we have enormous amount of talent across many many discipline to be able to come together and fix the problem very very quickly .,science
but it sound one of the fascinating challenge here is for the system and the decoding side to be adaptable across different timescales .,science
whether it is movement of thread or different aspect of signal drift on the software of the human brain something changing nolan talk about cursor drift they could be corrected and there a whole ux challenge to how to do that .,science
it sound adaptability is a fundamental property that ha to be engineered in .,science
it is .,science
i think a a company we are extremely vertically integrated .,science
we make these thin film array in our own micro fab .,science
yeah there you said built in house .,science
this whole paragraph here from this blog post is pretty gangster .,science
building the technology described above ha been no small feat .,science
and there a bunch of link here that i recommend people click on .,science
we constructed inhouse micro fabrication capability to rapidly produce various iteration of thin film array that constitute our electrode thread .,science
we created a custom femtosecond laser mill to manufacture component with micro level precision .,science
i think there a tweet associated with this .,science
thats the whole thing that we can get into .,science
yeah this .,science
what are we looking at here ?,science
this thing .,science
in le than one minute our custom made femtosecond laser mill cut this geometry in the tip of our needle .,science
we are looking at this weirdly shaped needle .,science
the tip is only ten to twelve micron and with only slightly larger than the diameter of a red blood cell the small size allows threat to be inserted with minimal damage to the cortex .,science
whats interesting about this geometry ?,science
well look at this geometry of a needle .,science
this is the needle thats engaging with the loop in the thread .,science
they are the one that thread the loop and then peel it from the silicon backing .,science
and then this is the thing that get inserted into the tissue .,science
and then this pull out leaving the thread .,science
and this a notch or the shark tooth that we used to call is the thing that is grasping the loop .,science
and then it is designed in such a way such that when you pull out it leaf the loop .,science
and the robot is controlling this needle .,science
this is housed in a cannula .,science
and the robot ha a lot of the optic that look for where the loop is .,science
there a four hundred and five nanometer light that cause the polyimide to fluoresce that you can locate the location of the loop .,science
the loop light up ?,science
micron precision process .,science
whats interesting about the robot that it take to do that thats pretty crazy .,science
thats pretty crazy that robot is able to get this precision .,science
yeah our robot is quite heavy our current version of it .,science
there is it is a giant granite slab that weighs about a ton .,science
because it need to be sensitive to vibration environmental vibration .,science
and then a the head is moving at the speed that is moving there a lot of motion control to make sure that you can achieve that level of precision .,science
a lot of optic that zoom in on that .,science
we are working on next generation of the robot that is lighter easier to transport .,science
it is a feat to move the robot to insert the machine .,science
and it is far superior to a human surgeon at this time for this particular task .,science
let alone you try to thread a loop in a sewing kit this is we are talking fraction of human hair .,science
these thing it is not visible .,science
continuing the paragraph we developed novel hardware and software testing system such a our accelerated lifetime testing rack and simulated surgery environment which is pretty cool to stress test and validate the robustness of our technology .,science
we performed many rehearsal of our surgery to refine our procedure and make them second nature .,science
this is pretty cool .,science
we practice surgery on proxy with all the hardware and instrument needed in our mock or in the engineering space .,science
this help u rapidly test and measure .,science
there proxy .,science
yeah this proxy is super cool .,science
there a 3d printed skull from the image that is taken at barrow a a this hydrogel mix synthetic polymer thing that mimic the mechanical property of the brain .,science
it also ha vasculature of the person .,science
what we are talking about here and there a lot of work that ha gone into making this set proxy that it is about finding the concentration of these different synthetic polymer to get the set of consistency for the needle dynamic a they are being inserted .,science
but we practice this surgery with the person nolans physiology and brain many many time prior to doing the surgery .,science
yeah where doe someone stand ?,science
what you are looking at is the picture .,science
this is in our office of this corner of the robot engineering space that we have created this mock or space that look exactly what they would experience all the staff would experience during their actual surgery .,science
it is any dense rehearsal where exactly where you are going to stand at what point and you practice that over and over and over again with an exact anatomy of someone that you are going to surgery .,science
and it got to a point where a lot of our engineer when we created a craniectomy they are that look very familiar .,science
weve seen that before .,science
and there wisdom you can gain through doing the same thing over and over and over .,science
it is a dura dream of sushi thing .,science
because then it is olympic athlete visualizes the olympics .,science
and then once you show up it feel easy .,science
it feel any other day .,science
it feel almost boring winning the gold medal .,science
cause you visualize this many time .,science
youve practiced this many time that nothing about u knew it is boring .,science
you win the gold medal is boring .,science
and the experience they talk about is mostly relief .,science
probably that they do not have to visualize it anymore .,science
the power of the mind to visualize and where there a whole field that study where muscle memory lie in cerebellum .,science
yeah it is incredible .,science
i think it wa a good place to ask the big question that people might have is how do we know every aspect of this that you describe is safe .,science
at the end of the day the gold standard is look at the tissue .,science
what trauma did you cause the tissue and doe that correlate to whatever behavioral anomaly that you may have seen ?,science
and thats the language to which we can communicate about the safety of inserting something into the brain and what type of trauma that you can cause .,science
we have an entire department department of pathology that look at these tissue slice .,science
there are many step that are involved in doing this once you have study that are launched to with particular end point in mind .,science
at some point you have to euthanize the animal and then you go through a necropsy to collect the brain tissue sample .,science
you fix them in formalin and you gross them you section them and you look at individual slice to see what reaction or lack thereof exists .,science
thats the the language to which fda speaks and a for u to evaluate the safety of the insertion mechanism a a the threat at various different time point both acute .,science
anywhere between zero to three month to beyond three month .,science
those are the detail of an extremely high standard of safety that ha to be reached .,science
fda supervises this but there in general a very high standard .,science
and every aspect of this including the surgery i think matthew mcdougal ha mentioned it the standard is let say how to put it politely higher than maybe some other operation that we take for granted .,science
the standard for all the surgical stuff here is extremely high .,science
very high .,science
it is a highly highly regulated environment with the governing agency that scrutinize every medical device that get marketed .,science
and i think it is a good thing .,science
it is good to have those high standard and we try to hold extremely high standard to understand what damage of any these innovative emerging technology and new technology that we are building are .,science
and far we have been extremely impressed by lack of immune response from these thread .,science
speaking of which you talk to me with excitement about the histology and some of the image that you are able to share .,science
can you explain to me what we are looking at ?,science
yeah what you are looking at is a stained tissue image .,science
this is a sectioned tissue slice from an animal that wa implanted for seven month .,science
a chronic time point .,science
and you are seeing all these different color .,science
and each color indicates specific type of cell type .,science
purple and pink are astrocyte and microglia respectively they are type of glial cell .,science
and the other thing that people may not be aware of is your brain is not made up of soup of neuron and axon .,science
there are other cell glial cell that is the glue and also react .,science
if there are any trauma or damage to the tissue .,science
with the brown or the neuron ?,science
the brown or the neuron .,science
what you are seeing is in this macro image you are seeing these circle highlighted in white the insertion site .,science
and when you zoom into one of those the thread .,science
and then in this particular case i think we are seeing about the sixteen wire that are going into the page .,science
and the incredible thing here is the fact that you have the neuron that are these brown structure or brown circular or elliptical thing that are touching and abutting the thread .,science
what this is saying is that there zero trauma thats caused during this insertion .,science
with these neural interface these microelectros that you insert that is one of the most common mode of failure .,science
when you insert these thread the utare it cause neuronal death around the site because you are inserting a foreign object ?,science
and that elicit these immune response through microglia and astrocyte .,science
they form this protective layer around it .,science
not only are you killing the neuron cell but you are also creating this protective layer that then prevents you from recording neural signal because you are getting further and further away from the neuron that you are trying to record .,science
and that is the biggest mode of failure .,science
and in this particular example in that insert it is about fifty micron with that scale bar the neuron seem to be attracted to it .,science
and there certainly no trauma .,science
thats such a beautiful image by the way .,science
the brown of the neuron for some reason i can not look away it is cool .,science
and the way that these thing your tissue generally do not have these beautiful color .,science
this is multiplex stain that us these different protein that are staining these at different color .,science
we use very standard set of staining technique with he eba1 and nuen and gfap .,science
if you go to the next image this is also illustrates the second point because you can make an argument .,science
and initially when we saw the previous image we said are the thread floating ?,science
what is happening here ?,science
are we looking at the thing ?,science
what we did is we did another stain and this is all done inhouse of this lysan trichrome stain which is in blue that show these collagen layer .,science
the blue you do not want the blue around the implant thread because that mean that there some scarring thats happened .,science
and what you are seeing if you look at individual thread is that you do not see any of the blue which mean that there ha been absolutely or very very minimal to a point where it is not detectable amount of trauma in these inserted thread .,science
that presumably is one of the big benefit of having this flexible thread .,science
yeah we think this is primarily due to the size a a the flexibility of the thread .,science
also the fact that r1 is avoiding vascular we are not disrupting or we are not causing damage to the vessel and not breaking any of the bloodbrain barrier ha caused the immune response to be muted .,science
but this is also a nice illustration of the size of thing .,science
this is the tip of the thread .,science
yeah those are neuron .,science
they are and they are neuron and this is the thread listening and the electrode are positioned how ?,science
yeah this is what you are looking at it is not electrode themselves those are the conductive wire .,science
each of those should probably be two micron in width .,science
what we are looking at is we are looking at the coronal slice .,science
we are looking at some slice of the tissue .,science
a you go deeper you will obviously have le and le of the tapering of the thread .,science
but yeah the point being that there cell around the inserted site which is an incredible thing to see .,science
ive never seen anything this .,science
how easy and safe is it to remove the implant ?,science
yeah it depends on when .,science
in the first three month or after the surgery there a lot of tissue modeling thats happening .,science
similar to when you got a cut you obviously start over first couple of week or depending on the size of the wound scar tissue forming ?,science
there are these contracted and then in the end they turn it to scab and you can scab it off .,science
the same thing happens in the brain .,science
and it is a very dynamic environment .,science
and before the scar tissue or the neo membrane or the new membrane that form it is quite easy to pull them out .,science
and there minimal trauma thats caused during that .,science
once the scar tissue form and with nolan a we believe that thats the thing thats currently anchoring the thread .,science
we havent seen any more movement since then .,science
they are quite stable .,science
it get harder to completely extract the thread .,science
our current method for removing the device is cutting the thread leaving the tissue intact and then unscrewing and taking the implant out .,science
and that hole is now gon na be plugged with either another narrow link or with a plasticbased cap .,science
is it to leave the thread in there forever ?,science
yeah we think .,science
weve done study where we left them there .,science
and one of the biggest concern that we had is do they migrate and do they get to a point where they should not be ?,science
again once the scar tissue form they get anchored in place .,science
and i should also say that when we say upgrade we are not talking in theory here .,science
weve upgraded many many time .,science
most of our monkey or nonhuman primate nhp have been upgraded .,science
pedro who you saw playing mine pong ha the latest version of the device since two year ago and is seemingly very happy and healthy and fat .,science
whats designed for the future the upgrade procedure ?,science
maybe for nolan what would the upgrade look ?,science
it wa essentially what you are mentioning is there a way to upgrade the device internally where you take it apart and keep the capsule and upgrade the internals ?,science
yeah there are a couple of different thing here .,science
for nolan if we were to upgrade what we would have to do is either cut the thread or extract the thread depending on the situation there in term of how they are anchored or scarred in .,science
if you were to remove them with the dural substitute you have an intact grain you can reinsert different thread with the updated implant package .,science
there are a couple of different other way that we are thinking about the future of what the upgradeable system look .,science
one is at the moment we currently remove the dural this thick layer that protects the brain but that is the thing that proliferates the scar tissue formation .,science
typically the general good rule of thumb is you wan na leave the nature a is and not disrupt it a much .,science
we are looking at way to insert the thread through the dural which come with different set of challenge such a it is a pretty thick thick layer how do you penetrate that without breaking the needle ?,science
we are looking at different needle design for that a a the loop engagement .,science
the other biggest challenge are it is quite opaque optically with white light illumination how do you avoid still this biggest advantage that we have of avoiding basketure ?,science
how do you image through that ?,science
how do you still mediate that ?,science
there are other imaging technique that we are looking at to enable that but our hypothesis is that based on some of the early evidence that we have doing through the dural insertion will cause minimal scarring that cause them to be much easier to extract over time .,science
and then one can be under the dural one can be above the dural being the plug for the skull .,science
that would allow you to reuse the thread ?,science
this lead to the natural question of what is the pathway to scaling the increase in the number of thread ?,science
is that a priority ?,science
is that whats the technical challenger ?,science
yeah that is a priority .,science
for next version of the implant the key metric that we are looking to improve are number of channel recording from more and more neuron .,science
we have a pathway to go from currently onezero to hopefully threezero if not sixzero by end of this year .,science
and then end of next year we wan na get to even more sixteenzero .,science
there a couple of limitation to that .,science
one is obviously being able to photo lithographically print those wire .,science
a i mentioned it is two micron in width and spacing .,science
obviously there are chip that are much more advanced than those type of resolution .,science
and we have some of the tool that we have brought in the house to be able to do that .,science
trace will be narrower that you have to have more of the wire coming up into the chip .,science
chip also can not linearly consume more energy a you have more and more channel .,science
there a lot of innovation in the circuit and architecture a a the circuit design topology to make them lower power .,science
you need to also think about if you have all of these spike how do you send that off to the end application ?,science
you need to think about then with limitation there and potentially innovation in signal processing .,science
physically one of the biggest challenge is gon na be the interface .,science
it is always the interface that break bonding the stemfilm array to the electronics .,science
it start to become very very highly dense interconnects .,science
how do you connect the rise that ?,science
there a lot of innovation in the 3d integration in the recent year that we can take advantage of .,science
one of the biggest challenge that we do have is forming this hermetic barrier ?,science
that this is an extremely harsh environment that we are in the brain .,science
how do you test that ?,science
whats the development environment ?,science
yeah to simulate that harshness .,science
yeah this is where the accelerated life tester essentially is a brain in a vat .,science
it is a vessel that is made up of and again for all intent and purpose for this particular type of test your brain is a salt water .,science
and you can also put some other set of chemical reactive oxygen specie that get at these interface and trying to cause a reaction to pull it apart .,science
but you could also increase the rate at which these interface are aging by increasing temperature .,science
what we do is we increase in our alt chamber by twenty degree celsius that increase the aging by four time essentially one day in alt chamber is four day in calendar year .,science
and we look at whether the implant still are intact including the thread .,science
and operation and all of that .,science
and operation and all of that .,science
obviously it is not an exact same environment a a brain because brain ha mechanical other more biological group that attack at it but it is a good test environment testing environment for at least the enclosure and the strength of the enclosure .,science
and weve had implant the current version of the implant that ha been in there for close to two and a half year which is equivalent to a decade and they seem to be fine .,science
it is interesting that the brain a close approximation is warm salt water hot salt water is a good testing environment .,science
by the way i am drinking element which is salt water which is making me kinda it doesnt have computational power the way the brain doe but maybe in term of all the characteristic is quite similar and i am consuming it .,science
yeah you have to get it at the ph too .,science
and then consciousness will emerge .,science
by the way the other thing that also is interesting about our enclosure is if you look at our implant it is not your common looking medical implant that usually is in case in a titanium can thats laser welded .,science
we use this polymer called pctfe polychlorotriphloroethylene which is commonly used in blister pack .,science
when you have a pill and you are trying to pop a pill there that plastic membrane thats what this is .,science
no one ever used this except u . and the reason we wanted to do this is because it is electromagnetically transparent .,science
when we talked about the electromagnetic inductive charging with titanium can usually if you wan na do something that you have to have a sapphire window and it is a very very tough process to scale .,science
you are doing a lot of iteration here in every aspect of this the material the software the whole ... the whole shipping .,science
you mentioned scaling .,science
is it possible to have multiple neural link device a one of the way of scaling to have multiple neural link device implanted ?,science
thats the goal thats the goal .,science
yeah weve had our monkey have had two neural link one in each hemisphere .,science
and then we are also looking at potential of having one in motor cortex one in visual cortex and one in wherever other cortex .,science
focusing on a particular function one neural link device .,science
i wonder if there some level of customization that can be done on the compute side .,science
for the motor cortex .,science
thats the goal .,science
and we talk about at neurallink building a generalized neural interface to the brain .,science
and that also is strategically how we are approaching this with marketing and also with regulatory which is hey look we have the robot and the robot can access any part of the cortex .,science
now we are focused on motor cortex with current version of the n1 thats specialized for motor decoding task .,science
but also at the end of the day there a general compute available there .,science
but typically if you wan na get down to hyperoptimizing for power and efficiency you do need to get to some specialized function ?,science
but what we are saying is that hey you are now used to this robotic insertion technique which took many many year of showing data and conversation with the fda .,science
and also internally convincing ourselves that this is safe .,science
and now the difference is that if we go to other part of the brain visual cortex which we are interested in a our second product obviously it is a completely different environment .,science
the cortex is laid out very very differently .,science
it is gon na be more stimulation focus rather than recording creating visual percept .,science
but in the end we are using the same thin film array technology .,science
we are using the same robot insertion technology .,science
we are using the same packaging technology .,science
now it is more the conversation focused around what are the difference and what are the implication of those difference in safety and efficacy .,science
the way you said second product is both hilarious and awesome to me .,science
that product being restoring sight for blind people .,science
can you speak to stimulating the visual cortex ?,science
the possibility there are incredible to be able to give that gift back to people who do not have sight or even any aspect of that .,science
can you speak to the challenge of ... there several challenge here .,science
one of which is you said from recording to stimulation .,science
any aspect of that that you are both excited and see the challenge of .,science
yeah i guess ill start by saying that we have been capable of stimulating through our thin film array a a electronics for year .,science
we have demonstrated some of that capability for reanimating the limb in the spinal cord .,science
obviously for the current efs study weve hardware disabled that .,science
thats something that we wanted to embark a a separate journey .,science
and obviously there are many many different way to write information into the brain .,science
the way in which we are doing that is through electrical passing electrical current and causing that to change the local environment that you can artificially cause the neuron to depolarize in nearby area .,science
for vision specifically the way our visual system work it is both understood .,science
anything with brain there are aspect of it thats understood but in the end we do not know anything .,science
but the way visual system work is that you have photon hitting your eye .,science
and in your eye there are these specialized cell called photoreceptor cell that convert the photon energy into electrical signal .,science
and then they get that then get projected to your back of your head your visual cortex .,science
it go through a thymic system called lgn that then project it out .,science
and then in the visual cortex there visual area one or v one .,science
and then there a bunch of other higher level processing layer v two v three .,science
and there are interesting parallel .,science
and when you study the behavior of these convolutional neural network what the different layer of the network is detecting first they are detecting these edge and they are then detecting some more natural curve .,science
and then they start to detect object ?,science
similar thing happens in the brain .,science
and a lot of that ha been inspired and also it is been exciting to see some of the correlation there .,science
but thing from there where this cognition arise and where is color encoded ?,science
there not a lot of understanding fundamental understanding there .,science
in term of bringing sight back to those that are blind there are many different form of blindness .,science
there million people one million people in the u that are legally blind .,science
that mean certain score below in the visual test .,science
i think it is something if you can see something at twenty foot distance that normal people can see at two hundred foot distance if you are worse than that you are legally blind .,science
for the method that mean you can not function effectively .,science
using sight in the world .,science
yeah to navigate your environment .,science
and yeah there are different form of blindness .,science
there are form of blindness where there some degeneration of your retina his photoreceptor cell .,science
and the rest of your visual processing that i described is intact .,science
and for those type of individual you may not need to maybe stick electrode into the visual cortex .,science
you can build retinal prosthetic device that replaces the function of that retinal cell that are degenerated .,science
and there are many company that are working on that .,science
but thats a very small slice .,science
the obvious significance though smaller slice of folk that are legally blind .,science
if there any damage along that circuitry whether it is in the optic nerve or the lgn circuitry or any break in that circuit thats not gon na work for you .,science
and the source of where you need to cause that visual percept to happen because your biological mechanism of not doing that is by placing electrode in the visual cortex in the back of your head .,science
and the way in which this would work is that you would have an external camera whether it is something a unsophisticated a a gopro or some wearable rayban type glass that metas working on that capture a scene .,science
and that scene is then converted to a set of electrical impulse or stimulation pulse that you would activate in your visual cortex through these thin film array .,science
and by playing some concerted orchestra of these stimulation pattern you can create whats called phosphine which are these white yellowish dot that you can also create by pressing your eye .,science
you can create those percept by stimulating the visual cortex .,science
and the name of the game is have many of those and have those percept be the phosphine be a small a possible that you can start to tell apart they are the individual pixel of the screen .,science
this is incredible .,science
this is incredible .,science
you would be adding pixel and your brain would start to figure out what those pixel mean .,science
and with different kind of the system and the signal processing on all front .,science
the thing that it is a couple of thing .,science
one is obviously if you are blind from birth the way brain work especially in the early age neuroplasticity is nothing other than your brain and different part of your brain fighting for the limited territory .,science
and very very quickly case where people that are you also hear about people who are blind that have heightened sense of hearing or some other sens .,science
and the reason for that is is that cortex thats not used get taken over by these different part of the cortex .,science
for those type of individual i guess they are going to have to now map some other part of their sens into what they call vision but it is going to be obviously a very very different conscious experience before .,science
i think thats an interesting caveat .,science
the other thing that also is important to highlight is that we are currently limited by our biology in term of the wavelength that we can see .,science
there a very very small wavelength that is a visible light wavelength that we can see with our eye .,science
but when you have an external camera with this bci system you are not limited to that .,science
you can have infrared you can have uv you can have whatever other spectrum that you want to see .,science
and whether that get mapped to some weird conscious experience ive no idea .,science
but when i oftentimes i talk to people about the goal of neural ink being going beyond the limit of our biology .,science
thats what .,science
and if you are able to control the raw signal is that when we use our sight we are getting the photon and there not much processing on it .,science
if you are able to control that signal maybe you can do some processing .,science
maybe you do object detection ahead of time .,science
you are doing some preprocessing and there a lot of possibility to explore that .,science
it is not increasing thermal imaging that stuff but it is also doing some interesting processing .,science
my theory of how visual system work also is that there many thing happening in the world and there a lot of photon that are going into your eye .,science
and it is unclear exactly where some of the preprocessing step are happening but i think that from a fundamental perspective there much the reality that we are in if it is a reality is there much data .,science
and i think human are unable to eat enough to process all that information .,science
there some filtering that doe happen whether that happens in the retina whether that happens in different layer of the visual cortex unclear .,science
what you do is you end up adding these filter to narrow the information thats coming to you and being captured .,science
and i think thing our experience or our drug prophyllol that anesthetic drug or psychedelics what they are doing is they are swapping out these filter and putting in new one or removing all their one and controlling our conscious experience .,science
yeah man not to distract from the topic but i took a very high dose of ayahuasca in the amazon jungle .,science
yes it is a nice way to think about it .,science
you are swapping out different experience and we are narrowing being able to control that primarily at first to improve function not for entertainment purpose or enjoyment purpose but giving back lost function .,science
giving back lost function .,science
and there when the function is completely lost anything is a huge help .,science
would you implant a neural link device in your own brain ?,science
absolutely maybe not now but absolutely .,science
what capability once reached you start getting real curious and almost get a little antsy jealous of people that get a you watch them getting planted .,science
yeah i think even with our early participant if they start to do thing that i can not do which i think is in the realm of possibility for them to be able to get fifteen twenty if not one hundred bps ?,science
there nothing that fundamentally stop u from being able to achieve that type of performance .,science
i would certainly get jealous that they can do that .,science
i should say that watching nolan i get a little jealous because he having much fun and it seems such a chill way to play video game .,science
the thing that also is hard to appreciate sometimes is that he doing these thing while talking and it is multitasking ?,science
it is clearly it is obviously cognitively intensive but similar to how when we talk we move our hand these thing are multitasking he able to do that .,science
and you will not be able to do that with other assistive technology a far a i am aware .,science
if you are obviously using an eye tracking device you are very much fixated on that thing that you are trying to do .,science
and if you are using voice control if you say some other stuff yeah you do not get to use that .,science
yeah the multitasking aspect of that is interesting .,science
it is not the bps for the primary task it is the parallelization of multitasking .,science
if you take if you measure the bps for the entirety of the human organism .,science
if you are talking and doing a thing with your mind and looking around also there a lot of parallelization that can be happening .,science
but i think at some point for him if he want to achieve those high level bps it doe require full attention ?,science
and thats a separate circuitry that is a big mystery how attention work and .,science
yeah attention cognitive load ive done ive read a lot of literature on people doing two task .,science
you have your primary task and a secondary task .,science
and the secondary task is a source of distraction .,science
and how doe that affect the performance of the primary task ?,science
and there depending on the task there a lot of interesting this is an interesting computational device ?,science
and i think there who say the least ?,science
a lot of novel insight that can be gained from everything .,science
i personally am surprised that nolans able to do such incredible control of the cursor while talking .,science
and also being nervous at the same time because he talking all of u are if you are talking in front of the camera you get nervous .,science
all of those are coming into play he able to still achieve high performance .,science
surprising all of this is amazing .,science
and i think after researching this in depth i wanted your link .,science
and also the safety get in line .,science
we should say the registry is for people who have quadriplegia and all that stuff .,science
there would be a separate line for people .,science
they are curious myself .,science
now that nolan patient p1 is part of the ongoing prime study whats the high level vision for p2 p3 p4 p5 and the expansion into other human being that are getting to experience this implant ?,science
yeah the primary goal is for our study in the first place is to achieve safety endpoint understand safety of this device a a the implantation process .,science
and also at the same time understand the efficacy and the impact that it could have on the potential user life .,science
and because you have and you are living with tetraplegia it doesnt mean your situation is same a another person living with tetraplegia .,science
it is wildly wildly varying .,science
and it is something that we are hoping to also understand how our technology can serve not a very small slice of those individual but broader group of individual and being able to get the feedback to build the best product for them .,science
and thats required before you can then market the device .,science
and thats how it work in the u and generally around the world .,science
thats the process you follow .,science
our goal is to understand from people nolan p2 p3 future participant what aspect of our device need to improve .,science
if it turn out that people are i do not the fact that it last only six hour .,science
i wan na be able to use this computer for twenty four hour .,science
that is a user need and user requirement which we can only find out from being able to engage with them .,science
before the pivotal study there a rapid innovation based on individual experience .,science
you are learning from individual people how they use it the high resolution detail in term of cursor control and signal and all that stuff to life experience .,science
yeah there hardware change but also firmware update .,science
even when we had that recovery event for nolan he now ha the new firmware that he ha been updated with .,science
and similar to how your phone get updated all the time with new firmware for security patch whatever new functionality ui ?,science
and thats something that is possible with our implant .,science
it is not a static onetime device that can only do the thing that it said it can do .,science
similar to tesla you can do over the air firmware update and now you have completely new user interface and all this bell and whistle and improvement on everything the latest ?,science
when we say generalized platform thats what we are talking about .,science
yeah thats cool .,science
how the app that nolan is using there calibration all that stuff .,science
and then there update .,science
you click and get an update .,science
what other future capability are you looking to ?,science
you said vision thats a fascinating one .,science
what about accelerated typing or speech or this stuff ?,science
and what else is there ?,science
yeah those are still in the realm of movement program .,science
largely speaking we have two program .,science
we have the movement program and we have the vision program .,science
the movement program currently is focused around the digital freedom .,science
a you can easily guess if you can control to the cursor in the digital space you could move anything into physical space .,science
robotic arm wheelchair your environment or even whether it is through the phone or directly to those interface to those machine .,science
we are looking at way to expand those type of capability even for nolan .,science
that requires conversation with the fda and showing safety data for if there a robotic arm or wheelchair that we can guarantee that they are not going to hurt themselves accidentally ?,science
it is very different if you are moving stuff in the digital domain versus in the physical space you can potentially cause harm to the participant .,science
we are working through that now .,science
speech doe involve different area of the brain .,science
speech prosthetic is very very fascinating .,science
and there been a lot of amazing work thats been happening in academia .,science
sergei stavisky at uc davis jamie henderson and late krishna shnoy at stanford doing some incredible amount of work in improving speech neuro prosthetics .,science
and those are looking more at part of the motor cortex that are controlling these focal articulator and being able to even by mouthing the word or imagine speech you can pick up those signal .,science
the more sophisticated higher level processing area the broca area or warnicks area those are still very very big mystery in term of the underlying mechanism of how all that stuff work .,science
but yeah i think i think neurolynxs eventual goal is to understand those thing and be able to provide a platform and tool to be able to understand that and study that .,science
this is where i get to the pothead question .,science
do you think we can start getting insight into thing thought ?,science
speech is there a muscular component you said .,science
there the act of producing sound .,science
but then what about the internal thing cognition ?,science
low level thought and high level thought .,science
do you think well start noticing signal that could be picked up they could they could be understood they could be maybe used in order to interact with the outside world ?,science
in some way i guess this start to get into the hard problem of consciousness .,science
and on one hand all of these are at some point set of electrical signal that from there maybe it in itself is giving you the cognition or the meaning or somehow human mind is incredibly amazing storytelling machine .,science
we are telling ourselves and folding ourselves that there some interesting meaning here .,science
but i certainly think that pci and pci at the end of the day is a set of tool that help you study the underlying mechanism and in both local but also broader sense .,science
and whether there some interesting pattern of electrical signal that mean you are thinking this versus and you can either learn from many many set of data to correlate some of that and be able to do mind reading or not i am not sure .,science
i certainly would not pull that out a a possibility but i think pci alone probably can not do that .,science
there probably additional set of tool and framework and also hard problem of consciousness at the end of the day is rooted in this philosophical question of what is the meaning of it all ?,science
it is the nature of our existence .,science
where is the mind emerged from this complex network ?,science
yeah how doe the subjective experience emerge from a bunch of spike electrical spike ?,science
yeah we do think about pci and what we are building a a tool for understanding the mind the brain the only question that matter .,science
there there is some biological existence proof of what it would take to start to form some of these experience that may be unique .,science
if you look at every one of our brain they are two hemisphere .,science
there a leftsided brain there a sided brain and unless you have some other condition you normally do not feel left leg or leg .,science
what is happening there ?,science
if you look at the two hemisphere there a structure that connectorized the two called the corpus callosum that is supposed to have around two hundred to three hundred million connection or axon .,science
whether that mean thats the number of interface and electrode that we need to create some mind meld or from that whatever new conscious experience that you can experience .,science
but i do think that there an interesting existence proof that we all have .,science
and that threshold is unknown at this time .,science
yeah these thing everything in this domain is speculation ?,science
and then there will be youd be continuously pleasantly surprised .,science
do a world where there million of people ten of million hundred of million of people walking around with a neural link device or multiple neural link device in their brain ?,science
first of all there are if you look at worldwide people suffering from movement disorder and visual deficit thats in the ten if not hundred of million of people .,science
that alone i think there a lot of benefit and potential good that we can do with this type of technology .,science
and when you start to get into neural psychiatric application depression anxiety hunger or obesity ?,science
mood control of appetite .,science
that start to become very real to everyone .,science
not to mention that every most people on earth have a smartphone .,science
and once bci start competing with a smartphone a a preferred methodology of interacting with the digital world that also becomes an interesting thing .,science
yeah yeah this is even before going to that ?,science
there is almost the entire world that could benefit from these type of thing .,science
and then yeah if we are talking about next generation of how we interface with machine or even ourselves in many way i think bci can play a role in that .,science
and some of the thing that i also talk about is i do think that there is a real possibility that you could see eight billion people walking around with neuralink .,science
thank you much for pushing ahead .,science
and i look forward to that exciting future .,science
thanks for having me .,science
thanks for listening to this conversation with dj sa .,science
and now dear friend here matthew mcdougal the head neurosurgeon at neuralink .,science
when did you first become fascinated with the human brain ?,science
since forever a far back a i can remember ive been interested in the human brain .,science
i wa a thoughtful kid and a bit of an outsider .,science
and you sit there thinking about what the most important thing in the world are .,science
in your little tiny adolescent brain .,science
and if we knew more about how that worked how the brain encodes information and generates desire and generates agony and suffering we could do more about it .,science
you think about all the great triumph in human history you think about all the horrific tragedy you think about the holocaust you think about any prison full of human story and all of those problem boil down to neurochemistry .,science
if you get a little bit of control over that you provide people the option to do better .,science
and in the way i read history the way people have dealt with having better tool is that they most often in the end do better with huge asterisk .,science
but i think it is an interesting worthy and noble pursuit to give people more option more tool .,science
yeah thats a fascinating way to look at human history .,science
you imagine all these neurobiological mechanism stalin hitler all of these jankos khan all of them had a brain .,science
it is a bunch of neuron a few ten of billion of neuron gaining a bunch of information over a period of time .,science
they have a set of module that doe language and memory and all that .,science
and from there in the case of those people they are able to murder million of people .,science
and all that coming from there not some glorified notion of a dictator of this enormous mind or something this .,science
it is the brain .,science
a lot of that ha to do with how people that can organize those around them .,science
other brain .,science
yeah and i always find it interesting to look to primatology look to our closest nonhuman relative for clue a to how human are going to behave and what particular human are able to achieve .,science
and you look at chimpanzee and bonobo and they are similar but different in their social structure particularly .,science
and i went to emory in atlanta and studied under friend to all the great friend to all who wa the leading primatologist who recently died .,science
and his work at looking at chimp through the lens of how you would watch an episode of friend and understand the motivation of the character interacting with each other .,science
he would look at a chimp colony and apply that lens massively oversimplifying it .,science
and primarily it is the thing we want out of life food sex companionship power .,science
you can understand chimp and bonobo behavior in the same light much more easily .,science
and i think doing give you the tool you need to reduce human behavior from the false complexity that we layer onto it with language and look at it in term of these human are looking for companionship sex food power .,science
and i think thats a pretty powerful tool to have in understanding human behavior .,science
and i went to the amazon jungle for a few week and it is a very visceral reminder that a lot of life on earth is trying to get laid .,science
they are all screaming at each other .,science
i saw a lot of monkey and they are trying to impress each other or maybe there a battle for power but a lot of the battle for power ha to do with them getting laid .,science
breeding right often go with alpha status .,science
and if you can get a piece of that then you are gon na do .,science
and wed to think that we are somehow fundamentally different but especially when it come to primate where we are not we can use fancier poetic language but maybe some of the underlying drive that motivate u are similar .,science
yeah i think thats true .,science
and all of that is coming from this the brain .,science
when did you first start studying the brain a a biological mechanism ?,science
the moment i got to college i started looking around for lab that i could do neuroscience work in .,science
and sure enough there are big crossover between the two .,science
it get to a key point that i think go under recognized .,science
one of the thing people do not recognize or appreciate about the human brain enough and that is that it control or ha a huge role in almost everything that your body doe .,science
you try to name an example of something in your body that is not directly controlled or massively influenced by the brain .,science
and it is pretty hard .,science
you might say bone healing or something but even those system the hypothalamus and pituitary end up playing a role in coordinating the endocrine system that doe have a direct influence on say the calcium level in your blood that go to bone healing .,science
nonobvious connection between those thing implicate the brain a a potent prime mover in all of health .,science
one of the thing i realized in the other direction too how most of the system in the body integrated with the human brain they affect the brain also the immune system .,science
i think there people who study alzheimers and those kind of thing .,science
it is surprising how much you can understand of that from the immune system from the other system that do not obviously seem to have to do anything to do with the nervous system .,science
they all play together .,science
yeah you could understand how that would be driven by evolution too in some simple example .,science
it is pretty advantageous for your immune system to tell your brain hey now be antisocial for a few day .,science
do not go be the life of the party tonight .,science
in fact maybe cuddle up somewhere warm under a blanket and stay there for a day or two .,science
and sure enough that tends to be the behavior that both in animal and in human .,science
if you get sick elevated level of interleukin in your blood and tnf alpha in your blood ask the brain to cut back on social activity and even moving around .,science
you have lower locomotor activity in animal that are infected with virus .,science
from there the early day in neuroscience to surgery when did that step happen ?,science
it is a leap .,science
it wa an evolution of thought .,science
i wanted to study the brain .,science
i started studying the brain in undergrad in this neuroimmunology lab .,science
i from there realized at some point that i did not want to generate knowledge .,science
i wanted to effect real change in the actual world in actual people life .,science
and after having not thought about going into medical school i wa on a track to go into a phd program .,science
i said id that option .,science
id to potentially help tangible people in front of me .,science
and doing a little digging found that there exists these md phd program where you can choose not to choose between them and do both .,science
and i went to usc for medical school and had a joint phd program with caltech where i met chose that program particularly because of a researcher at caltech named richard anderson who one of the godfather of primate neuroscience .,science
it ha a macaque lab where utah array and other electrode were being inserted into the brain of monkey to try to understand how intention were being encoded in the brain .,science
and i wa at usc a i mentioned that happens to be one of the great neurosurgery program .,science
and i met these truly epic neurosurgeon alex kalesi and micah puzzo and steve gianata and marty wei these epic people that were human being in front of me .,science
and it changed my thinking from neurosurgeon are distant god that live on another planet and occasionally come and visit u to these are human that have problem and are people and there nothing fundamentally preventing me from being one of them .,science
and at the last minute in medical school i changed gear from going into a different specialty and switched into neurosurgery which cost me a year .,science
i had to do another year of research because i wa far along in the process that to switch into neurosurgery the deadline had already passed .,science
it wa a decision that cost time but absolutely worth it .,science
what wa the hardest part of the training on the neurosurgeon track ?,science
yeah two thing i think that residency in neurosurgery is a competition of pain of how much pain can you eat and smile ?,science
and there workout restriction that are not they are viewed at i think internally among the resident a weakness .,science
and most neurosurgery resident try to work a hard a they can .,science
and that i think necessarily mean working long hour and sometimes over the work hour limit .,science
and we care about being compliant with whatever regulation are in front of u . but i think more important than that people wan na give their all in becoming a better neurosurgeon because the stake are high .,science
and it is a real fight to get resident to say go home at the end of their shift and not stay and do more surgery .,science
are you saying one of the hardest thing is getting forcing them to get sleep and rest and all this stuff ?,science
historically that wa the case .,science
i think the next generation i think the next generation is more compliant and more selfcare .,science
we think thats what you mean .,science
wow thats fascinating .,science
what wa the second thing ?,science
the personality and maybe the two are connected .,science
wa it pretty competitive ?,science
it is competitive and it is also a we touched on earlier primate power .,science
and i think neurosurgery ha long had this aura of mystique and excellence and whatever about it .,science
and it is an invitation i think for people that are cloaked in that authority a boardcertified neurosurgeon is a walking fallacious appeal to authority .,science
you have license to walk into any room and act you are an expert on whatever .,science
and fighting that tendency is not something that most neurosurgeon do .,science
humility is not the forte .,science
yeah one of the i have friend who know you and whenever they speak about you that you have the surprising quality for neurosurgeon of humility .,science
which i think indicates it is not a common a perhaps in other profession .,science
because there is a gigantic heroic aspect to neurosurgery .,science
and i think it get to people head a little bit .,science
yeah i think that allows me to play at an elon company because elon one of his strength i think is to instantly see through fallacy from authority .,science
nobody walk into a room that he in and say god damn it you have to trust me .,science
i am the guy that built the last ten rocket or something .,science
and he say you did it wrong and we can do it better .,science
or i am the guy that kept ford alive for the last fifty year .,science
you listen to me on how to build car .,science
and you do not walk into a room that he in and say i am a neurosurgeon let me tell you how to do it .,science
i can think from first principle myself .,science
thank you very much .,science
and here how i think it ought to be done .,science
let go try it and see who .,science
and thats proven i think over and over in his case to be a very powerful approach .,science
if we take that tangent there a fascinating interdisciplinary achievement in your link that you get to interact with including elon .,science
what do you think is the secret to a successful team ?,science
what have you learned from getting to observe these folk ?,science
world expert in different discipline work together .,science
yeah there a sweet spot where people disagree and forcefully speak their mind and passionately defend their position and yet are still able to accept information from others and change their idea when they are wrong .,science
and i the analogy of how you polish rock .,science
you put hard thing in a hard container and spin it .,science
people bash against each other and out come a more refined product .,science
and to make a good team at neuralink weve tried to find people that are not afraid to defend their idea passionately and occasionally strongly disagree with people that they are working with and have the best idea come out on top .,science
it is not an easy balance again to refer back to the primate brain .,science
it is not something that is inherently built into the primate brain to say i passionately put all my chip on this position and now i am gon na walk away from it and admit you were .,science
part of our brain tell u that that is a power loss that is a loss of face a loss of standing in the community and now you are a zeta chump because your idea got trounced .,science
and you have to recognize that little voice in the back of your head is maladaptive and it is not helping the team win .,science
yeah you have to have the confidence to be able to walk away from an idea that you hold on to .,science
and if you do that often enough you are going to become the best in the world that you are thinking .,science
that that rapid iteration .,science
yeah youll at least be a member of a winning team .,science
ride the wave .,science
what did you learn ?,science
you mentioned there a lot of amazing neurosurgeon at usc .,science
what lesson about surgery and life have you learned from those folk ?,science
these folk were relentless in their pursuit of excellent neurosurgical technique decade over decade .,science
and i think we are recognized for that excellence .,science
it is especially marty wei steve giannata mike capuzzo they made huge contribution not only to surgical technique but they built training program that trained dozen or hundred of amazing neurosurgeon .,science
i wa lucky to be in their wake .,science
whats that you mentioned doing a surgery where the person is likely not to survive ?,science
doe that wear on you ?,science
it is especially challenging when you with all respect to our elder it doesnt hit much when you are taking care of an eighty year old and something wa going to get them pretty soon anyway .,science
and you lose a patient that .,science
and it wa part of the natural course of what is expected of them in the coming year regardless .,science
taking care of a father of two or three four young kid someone in their 30 that did not have it coming and they show up in your having their first seizure of their life and lo and behold theyve got a huge malignant inoperable or incurable brain tumor .,science
you can only do that .,science
i think a handful of time before it start eating away at your at your armor or a young mother that show up that ha a giant hemorrhage in her brain that shes not gon na survive from .,science
they bring her four year old daughter in to say goodbye one last time before they turn the ventilator off that they are not gon na survive .,science
the great henry marsh is an english neurosurgeon who said it best i think he say every neurosurgeon carry with them a private graveyard .,science
and i definitely feel that especially with young parent that kill me .,science
they had a lot more to give .,science
the loss of those people specifically ha a knockout .,science
it is a knockout effect thats going to make the world worse for people for a long time .,science
and it is hard to feel powerless in the face of that .,science
and thats where i think you have to be borderline evil to fight against a company neuralink or to constantly be taking potshot at u because what we are doing is to try to fix that stuff .,science
we are trying to give people option to reduce suffering .,science
we are trying to take the pain out of life that broken brain brings in .,science
and yeah this is our little way that we are fighting back against entropy i guess .,science
yeah the amount of suffering thats endured when some of the thing that we take for granted that our brain is able to do is taken away is immense .,science
and to be able to restore some of that functionality is a real gift .,science
yeah we are starting .,science
can you take me through the full procedure for implanting say the n1 chip in neuralink ?,science
yeah it is a simple simple straightforward procedure .,science
the human part of the surgery that i do is dead simple .,science
it is one of the most basic neurosurgery procedure imaginable .,science
and i think there evidence that some version of it ha been done for thousand of year .,science
that there are example i think from ancient egypt of healed or partially healed trefinations and from peru or ancient time in south america where these protosurgeons would drill hole in people skull presumably to let out the evil spirit but maybe to drain blood clot .,science
and there evidence of bone healing around the edge meaning the people at least survive some month after a procedure .,science
and what we are doing is that we are making a cut in the skin on the top of the head over the area of the brain that is the most potent representation of hand intention .,science
and if you are an expert concert pianist this part of your brain is lighting up the entire time you are playing .,science
we call it the hand knob .,science
the hand knob .,science
it is all the finger movement all of that is firing away .,science
yep there a little squiggle in the cortex there .,science
one of the fold in the brain is doubly folded on that spot .,science
and you can look at it on an mri and say thats the hand knob .,science
and then you do a functional test in a special mri called a functional mri fmri .,science
and this part of the brain light up when people even quadriplegic people whose brain are not connected to their finger movement anymore .,science
they imagine finger movement and this part of the brain still light up .,science
we can id that part of the brain in anyone who preparing to enter our trial and say that part of the brain we confirm is your hand intention area .,science
and ill make a little cut in the skin .,science
well flap the skin open opening the hood of a car only a lot smaller .,science
make a perfectly round one inch diameter hole in the skull .,science
remove that bit of skull .,science
open the lining of the brain the covering of the brain .,science
it is a little bag of water that the brain float in .,science
and then show that part of the brain to our robot .,science
and then this is where the robot shine .,science
and after the robot done with it part then the human come back in and put the implant into that hole in the skull and cover it up screwing it down to the skull and sewing the skin back together .,science
the whole thing is a few hour long it is extremely low risk compared to the average neurosurgery involving the brain that might say open up a deep part of the brain or manipulate blood vessel in the brain .,science
this opening on the surface of the brain with only cortical microinsertions carry significantly le risk than a lot of the tumor or aneurysm surgery that are routinely done .,science
cortical microinsertions that are via a robot and computer vision are designed to avoid the blood vessel .,science
i know you are a bit biased here but let compare human and machine .,science
what are human surgeon able to do and what are robot surgeon able to do at this stage of our human civilization development ?,science
yeah yeah thats a good question .,science
human are general purpose machine .,science
we are able to adapt to unusual situation we are able to change the plan on the fly .,science
when that blood vessel lay on the nerve it can cause intolerable horrific shooting pain that people describe being zapped with a cattle prod .,science
and the beautiful elegant surgery is to go move this blood vessel off the nerve .,science
the surgery team we went in there and started moving this blood vessel and then found that there wa a giant aneurysm on that blood vessel that wa not easily visible on the preop scan .,science
and the plan had to dynamically change and that the human surgeon had no problem with that we are trained for all those thing .,science
robot wouldnt do in that situation at least in their current incarnation fully robotic surgery the electrode insertion portion of the neuralink surgery .,science
it go according to a set plan .,science
and the human can interrupt the flow and change the plan but the robot can not change the plan midway through .,science
it operates according to how it wa programmed and how it wa asked to run .,science
it doe it job very precisely but not with a wide degree of latitude and how to react to changing condition .,science
there could be a very large number of way that you could be surprised a a surgeon .,science
when you enter a situation it could be subtle thing that you have to dynamically adjust to and robot are not good at that .,science
i think we are at the dawn of a new era with ai of the parameter for robot responsiveness to be dramatically broadened .,science
you can not look at a selfdriving car and say that it is operating under very narrow parameter .,science
if a chicken run across the road it wasnt necessarily programmed to deal with that specifically but a waymo or a selfdriving tesla would have no problem reacting to that appropriately .,science
and surgical robot are not there yet but give it time .,science
and then there could be a lot of semiautonomous possibility of maybe a robotic surgeon could say this situation is perfectly familiar or the situation is not familiar .,science
and in the not familiar case a human could take over .,science
but be very conservative and saying this for sure ha no issue no surprise and let the human deal with the surprise with the edge case all that .,science
thats one possibility .,science
you think eventually youll be out of the job .,science
you being neurosurgeon your job being neurosurgeon human there will not be many neurosurgeon left on this earth .,science
i am not worried about my job in the course of my professional life .,science
i think i would tell my kid not necessarily to go in this line of work depending on how thing look in twenty year .,science
it is fascinating because if i have a line of work i would say it is programming .,science
but then you realize these large language model come along and they are damn good at generating code .,science
overnight you could be surprised wow what is the contribution of the human ?,science
but then you start to think it doe seem that human have ability you said to deal with novel situation .,science
and in the case of programming it is the ability to come up with novel idea to solve problem .,science
it seems machine are not quite yet able to do that .,science
and when the stake are very high when it is life critical a it is in surgery especially neurosurgery then it start the stake are very high for a robot to replace a human .,science
but it is fascinating that in this case of neuralink there a humanrobot collaboration .,science
yeah yeah i do the part i can not do and it doe the part i can not do .,science
and we are friend .,science
i saw that there a lot of practice going on .,science
everything in neuralink is tested extremely rigorously .,science
but one of the thing i saw that there a proxy on which the surgery are performed .,science
this is both for the robot and for the human .,science
for everybody involved in the entire pipeline whats that practicing the surgery ?,science
there no analog to this in human surgery .,science
human surgery is this artisanal craft thats handed down directly from master to pupil over the generation .,science
the way you learn to be a surgeon on human is by doing surgery on human .,science
first you watch your professor do a bunch of surgery and then finally they put the trivial part of the surgery into your hand and then the more complex part .,science
and a your understanding of the point and the purpose of the surgery increase you get more responsibility in the perfect condition .,science
in neuralinks case the approach is a bit different .,science
we of course practiced a far a we could on animal .,science
we did hundred of animal surgery .,science
and when it came time to do the first human we had an amazing team of engineer build incredibly lifelike model .,science
one of the engineer fran romano in particular built a pulsating brain in a custom 3d printed skull that match exactly the patient anatomy including their face and scalp characteristic .,science
and when i wa able to practice that it is a close a it reasonably should get to being the real thing in all the detail including having a mannequin body attached to this custom head .,science
and when we were doing the practice surgery wed wheel that body into the ct scanner and take a mock ct scan and wheel it back in and conduct all the normal safety check verbally stop .,science
this patient we are confirming his identification is mannequin number blah blah blah .,science
and yeah we broke new ground on how extensively we practiced for this surgery .,science
there wa a historic moment a big milestone for neuralink in part for humanity with the first human getting a neuralink implant in january of this year .,science
take me through the surgery on noland .,science
what did it feel to be part of this ?,science
yeah we were lucky to have incredible partner at the baroneurologic institute .,science
they are i think the premier neurosurgical hospital in the world .,science
they made everything a easy a possible for the trial to get going and helped u immensely with their expertise on how to arrange the detail .,science
it wa a much more high pressure surgery in some way .,science
even though the outcome wasnt particularly in question in term of our participant safety the number of observer the number of people there conference room full of people watching live stream in the hospital rooting for this to go perfectly .,science
and that add pressure that is not typical for even the most intense production neurosurgery say removing a tumor or placing deep brain stimulation electrode and it had never been done on a human before .,science
there were unknown unknown .,science
unfortunately everything went and that surgery is one of the smoothest outcome we could have imagined .,science
you are extremely quarterback in the super bowl situation .,science
extremely nervous extremely .,science
i wa very pleased when it went and then when it wa over looking forward to number two .,science
yeah even with all that practice all of that have never been in a situation thats high stake in term of people watching .,science
and we should also probably mention given how the medium work a lot of people maybe in a dark way hoping it doesnt go .,science
i think wealth is easy to hate or envy or whatever .,science
and i think there a whole industry around driving click and bad news is great for click .,science
and any way to take an event and turn it into bad news is gon na be good for click .,science
it suck because i think it put pressure on people .,science
it discourages people from trying to solve hard problem because to solve hard problem you have to go into the unknown .,science
you have to do thing that havent been done before and you have to take risk .,science
calculated risk you have to do all safety precaution but risk never the le .,science
and i wish there would be more celebration of that of the risk taking versus people waiting on the sideline waiting for failure and then pointing out the failure yeah it suck .,science
but in this case it is great that everything went flawlessly but it is unnecessary pressure i would say .,science
now that there is a human with literal skin in the game there a participant whose wellbeing ride on this doing you have to be a pretty bad person to be rooting for that to go wrong .,science
and hopefully people look in the mirror and realize that at some point .,science
did you get to front row seat watch the robot work what ?,science
you get to see the whole thing ?,science
yeah because an md need to be in charge of all of the medical decisionmaking throughout the process .,science
i unscrubbed from the surgery after exposing the brain and presenting it to the robot and placed the target on the robot software interface that tell the robot where it is going to insert each thread that wa done with my hand on the mouse for whatever thats worth .,science
you were the one placing the target ?,science
it the robot with a computer vision provides a bunch of candidate and you finalize the decision. . the software engineer are amazing on this team .,science
and they provided an interface where you can essentially use a lasso tool and select a prime area of brain real estate and it will automatically avoid the blood vessel in that region and automatically place a bunch of target .,science
that allows the human robot operator to select good area of brain and make dense application of target in those region .,science
the region we think are gon na have the most high fidelity representation of finger movement and arm movement intention .,science
ive seen image of this .,science
for me with ocds for some reason are pleasant .,science
i think there a subreddit called oddly satisfying .,science
love that subreddit .,science
it is oddly satisfying to see the different target site avoiding the blood vessel and also maximizing the usefulness of those location for the signal .,science
it is .,science
a a person who ha a visceral reaction to the brain bleeding i can tell you it is .,science
it is extremely satisfying watching the electrode themselves go into the brain and not cause bleeding .,science
yeah you said the feeling wa of relief when everything went perfectly .,science
how deep in the brain can you currently go and eventually go ?,science
let say on the neural link side it seems the deeper you go in the brain the more challenging it becomes .,science
talking broadly about neurosurgery we can get anywhere .,science
it is routine for me to put deep brain stimulating electrode near the very bottom of the brain entering from the top and passing about a two millimeter wire all the way into the bottom of the brain .,science
and thats not revolutionary .,science
a lot of people do that .,science
and we can do that with very high precision .,science
i use a robot from globus to do that surgery .,science
several time a month .,science
it is pretty routine .,science
what are your eye in that situation ?,science
what are you seeing ?,science
what technology can you use to visualize where you are to light your way ?,science
yeah it is a cool process on the software side .,science
you take a preoperative mri thats extremely high resolution data of the entire brain .,science
you put the patient to sleep put their head in a frame that hold the skull very rigidly and then you take a ct scan of their head while they are asleep with that frame on and then merge the mri and the ct in software .,science
you have a plan based on the mri where you can see these nucleus deep in the brain .,science
you can not see them on ct but if you trust the merging of the two image then you indirectly know on the ct where that is and therefore indirectly know where in reference to the titanium frame screwed to their head those target are .,science
and this is 60 technology to manually compute trajectory given the entry point and target and dial in some goofy looking titanium actuator with manual actuator with little tick mark on them .,science
the modern version of that is to use a robot a little cuckoo arm you might see it building car at the tesla factory .,science
you end up with the electrode very very precisely placed far from the skull surface .,science
now thats standard technology thats already been out in the world for a while .,science
neuralink now is focused entirely on cortical target surface target because there no trivial way to get say hundred of wire deep inside the brain without doing a lot of damage .,science
your question what do ?,science
i see an mri on a screen .,science
i can not see everything that that db electrode is passing through on it way to that deep target .,science
and it is accepted with this approach that there gon na be about one in a hundred patient who have a bleed somewhere in the brain a a result of passing that wire blindly into the deep part of the brain .,science
thats not an acceptable safety profile for neuralink .,science
we start from the position that we want this to be dramatically maybe two or three order of magnitude safer than that .,science
safe enough that you or i without a profound medical problem might on our lunch break someday say yeah sure ill get that .,science
id be meaning to upgrade to the latest version .,science
and the safety constraint given that are high .,science
and we havent settled on a final solution for arbitrarily approaching deep target in the brain .,science
it is interesting because you have to avoid blood vessel somehow .,science
you have to maybe there creative way of doing the same thing mapping out high resolution geometry of blood vessel .,science
and then you can go in blind but how do you map out that in a way thats super stable ?,science
it is a lot of interesting challenge there ?,science
but there a lot to do on the surface .,science
weve got vision on the surface .,science
we have made a huge amount of progress sewing electrode into the spinal cord a a potential workaround for a spinal cord injury that would allow a brainmounted implant to translate motor intention to a spinemounted implant that can affect muscle contraction in previously paralyzed arm and leg .,science
thats incredible .,science
the effort there is to try to bridge the brain to the spinal cord to the peripheral nerve .,science
how hard is that to do ?,science
we have that working in very crude form in animal .,science
thats amazing .,science
yeah weve done it .,science
similar to with nolan where he able to digitally move the cursor here you are doing the same communication but with the actual effector that you have .,science
thats fascinating .,science
we have anesthetized animal doing grasp and moving their leg in a walking pattern .,science
again early day but the future is bright for this thing .,science
and people with paralysis should look forward to that bright future .,science
they are gon na have option .,science
yeah and there a lot of intermediate or extra option where you take an optimist robot the arm and to be able to control the arm .,science
the finger the hand the arm is a prosthetic .,science
yeah that go hand in hand .,science
although i did not quite understand until thinking about it deeply and doing more research about neuralink how much you can do on the digital side .,science
there digital telepathy .,science
i did not quite understand that you can map the intention a you described in the hand knob area .,science
you can map the intention .,science
imagine it think about it .,science
that intention can be mapped to actual action in the digital world .,science
and now more and more much can be done in the digital world that it can reconnect you to the outside world .,science
it can allow you to have freedom have independence if you are a quadriplegic .,science
thats powerful .,science
you can go far with that .,science
yeah our first participant is he incredible .,science
he breaking world record left and .,science
and he having fun with it it is great .,science
going back to the surgery your whole journey you mentioned to me offline you have surgery on monday .,science
you are you are doing surgery all the time .,science
yeah maybe the ridiculous question .,science
what doe it take to get good at surgery ?,science
practice repetition .,science
same with anything else .,science
there a million way of people saying the same thing and selling book saying it but you call it tenzero hour .,science
you call it spend some chunk of your life some percentage of your life focusing on this obsessing about getting better at it .,science
repetition humility recognizing that you are not perfect at any stage along the way recognizing youve got improvement to make in your technique being open to feedback and coaching from people with a different perspective on how to do it .,science
and then the constant will to do better that fortunately if you are not a sociopath i think your patient bring that with them to the office visit every day .,science
they force you to wan na do better all the time .,science
yeah to step up .,science
it is a real human being a real human being that you can help .,science
every surgery even if it is the same exact surgery is there a lot of variability between that surgery and a different person ?,science
a good example for u is the angle of the skull relative to the normal plane of the body axis of the skull overhand knob is pretty wide variation .,science
some people have flat skull and some people have steeply angled skull over that area and that ha consequence for how their head can be fixed in the frame that we use and how the robot ha to approach the skull .,science
and yeah people body are built a differently a the people walking down the street a much variability in body shape and size a there .,science
we see in brain anatomy and skull anatomy there are some people who weve had to exclude from our trial for having skull that are too thick or too thin or scalp thats too thick or too thin .,science
i think we have the middle ninety seven or of people but you can not account for all human anatomy variability .,science
how much mushiness and mess is there ?,science
cause i taking biology class the diagram are always clean and crisp neuroscience the picture of neuron are always nice .,science
but whenever i look at picture of real brain they are all i do not know whats going on .,science
how much are biological system in reality ?,science
how hard is it to figure out whats going on ?,science
occasionally when you are first starting to do this and you open the skull it doesnt match what you thought you were gon na see based on the mri .,science
and with more experience you learn to peel back that layer of blood vessel and see the underlying pattern of wrinkle in the brain and use that a a landmark for where you are .,science
the wrinkle are a landmark ?,science
i wa describing hand knob earlier thats a pattern of the wrinkle in the brain .,science
it is this greek letter omega shaped area of the brain .,science
you could recognize the hand knob area if i show you a thousand brain and give you one minute with each youd be yep thats that .,science
and there is some uniqueness to that area of the brain in term of the geometry the topology of the thing .,science
where is it about in the ... you have this strip of brain running down the top called the primary motor area .,science
and i am sure youve seen this picture of the homunculus laid over the surface of the brain the weird little guy with huge lip and giant hand .,science
that guy lay with his leg up at the top of the brain and face the arm area farther down and then some mouth lip tongue area farther down .,science
and the hand is in there .,science
and then the area that control speech at least on the left side of the brain in most people are below that .,science
and any muscle that you voluntarily move in your body the vast majority of that reference that strip or those intention come from that strip of brain and the wrinkle for hand knob is in the middle of that .,science
and vision is back here .,science
also close to the surface .,science
and this get to your question about how deep can you get to do vision .,science
we can not do the surface of the brain we have to be able to go in not a deep a wed have to go for db but maybe a centimeter deeper than we are used to for hand insertion .,science
and thats work in progress .,science
thats a new set of challenge to overcome .,science
by the way you mentioned the utah rate and i saw a picture of that and that thing look terrifying .,science
that nail .,science
it is because it is rigid .,science
and then if you look at the thread they are flexible .,science
what can you say thats interesting to you about the flexible that approach of the flexible thread to deliver the electrode next to the neuron ?,science
yeah the goal there come from experience .,science
we stand on the shoulder of people that made utah ray and used utah ray for decade before we ever even came along .,science
neuralink arose partly this approach to technology arose out of a need recognized after utah ray would fail routinely because the rigid electrode those spike that are hammered using an air hammer into the brain .,science
those spike generate a bad immune response that encapsulates the electrode spike in scar tissue essentially .,science
and one of the project that wa being worked on in the anderson lab at caltech when i got there wa to see if you could use chemotherapy to prevent the formation of scar .,science
thing are pretty bad when you are jamming a bed of nail into the brain and then treating that with chemotherapy to try to prevent scar tissue .,science
it is maybe weve gotten off track here guy .,science
maybe there a fundamental redesign necessary .,science
and neuralinks approach of using highly flexible tiny electrode avoids a lot of the bleeding avoids a lot of the immune response that end up happening when rigid electrode are pounded into the brain .,science
and what we see is our electrode longevity and functionality and the health of the brain tissue immediately surrounding the electrode is excellent .,science
it go on for year now in our animal model .,science
what do most people not understand about the biology of the brain ?,science
well mention the vasculature .,science
thats interesting .,science
i think the most interesting maybe underappreciated fact is that it doe control almost everything .,science
out of a blue example imagine you want a lever on fertility .,science
you want to be able to turn fertility on and off .,science
there are legitimate target in the brain itself to modulate fertility say blood pressure .,science
you want to modulate blood pressure .,science
there are legitimate target in the brain for doing that .,science
thing that are not immediately obvious a brain problem are potentially solvable in the brain .,science
and i think it is an underexplored area for primary treatment of all the thing that bother people .,science
thats a fascinating way to look at it .,science
there a lot of condition we might think have nothing to do with the brain but they might be symptom of something that started in the brain .,science
the actual source of the problem the primary source is something in the brain .,science
not always .,science
kidney disease is real but there are lever you can pull in the brain that affect all of these system .,science
there knob .,science
onoff switch and knob in the brain from which this all originates .,science
would you have a neural link chip implanted in your brain ?,science
i think use case now is use a mouse .,science
i can already do that .,science
and there no value proposition on safety ground alone .,science
ill do it tomorrow .,science
you say the use case of the mouse .,science
is it after researching all this and part of it is watching nolan have much fun ?,science
if you can get that bit per second look high with the mouse being able to interact .,science
if you think about it the way on the smartphone the way you swipe that wa transformational how we interact with the thing .,science
it is subtle .,science
you do not realize it but to be able to touch a phone and to scroll with your finger thats that changed everything .,science
people were sure you need a keyboard to type .,science
there a lot of hci aspect to that that changed how we interact with computer .,science
there could be a certain rate of speed with the mouse that would change everything .,science
you might be able to click around a screen extremely fast .,science
i can see myself getting the neural link for much more rapid interaction with the digital device .,science
i think recording speech intention from the brain might change thing a . the value proposition for the average person .,science
a keyboard is a pretty clunky human interface requires a lot of training .,science
it is highly variable in the maximum performance that the average person can achieve .,science
i think taking that out of the equation and having a natural word to computer interface might change thing for a lot of people .,science
itd be hilarious if that is the reason people do it .,science
even if you have speech to text thats extremely accurate .,science
it currently is not but it is say youve gotten super accurate .,science
itd be hilarious if people went for neural link you avoid the embarrassing aspect of speaking looking a douchebag speaking to your phone in public which is a real constraint .,science
with a bone conducting case that can be an invisible headphone say and the ability to think word into software and have it respond to you that start to sound embedded superintelligence .,science
if you can silently ask for the wikipedia article on any subject and have it read to you without any observable change happening in the outside world for one thing standardized testing is obsolete .,science
if it is done on the ux side it could change i do not know if it transforms society but it can create a shift in the way we interact with digital device in the way that a smartphone did .,science
now having to look into the safety of everything involved i would try it .,science
it doesnt have to go to some incredible thing where you have it connects your vision or to some other it connects all over your brain .,science
that could be connecting to the hand knob .,science
you might have a lot of interesting interaction humancomputer interaction possibility .,science
thats interesting .,science
the technology on the academic side is progressing at light speed here .,science
i think there wa a amazing paper out of uc davis at sergei staviskys lab that made an initial solve of speech decode .,science
it wa something one hundred and twenty fivezero word that they were getting with very high accuracy which is you are thinking the word ?,science
thinking the word and you are able to get it .,science
you have to have the intention of speaking it. . do that inner voice .,science
it is amazing to me that you can do the intention to signal mapping .,science
all you have to do is imagine yourself doing it .,science
and if you get the feedback that it worked you can get good at that .,science
your brain will first of all adjust and you develop it any other skill .,science
touch typing you develop it in that same way .,science
to me it is fascinating to be able to even to play with that .,science
honestly i would get a new link to be able to play with that .,science
to play with the capacity the capability of my mind to learn this skill .,science
it is learning the skill of typing and learning the skill of moving a mouse .,science
it is another skill of moving the mouse not with my physical body but with my mind .,science
i can not wait to see what people do with it .,science
i feel we are caveman now .,science
we are banging rock with a stick and thinking that we are making music .,science
at some point when these are more widespread there going to be the equivalent of a piano that someone can make art with their brain in a way that we did not even anticipate .,science
i am looking forward to it .,science
give it to a teenager .,science
anytime i think i am good at something ill always go to i do not know even with the bit per second and playing a video game .,science
you realize you give it to a teenager .,science
you are giving your link to a teenager the large number of them .,science
the stuff that get good at stuff .,science
they are going to get hundred of bit per second .,science
even with the current technology .,science
because it is also addicting how the number go up aspect of it of improving and training .,science
because it is almost a skill .,science
and plus there a software on the other end that adapts to you .,science
and especially if the adapting procedure algorithm becomes better and better and better you are learning together .,science
we are scratching the surface on that now .,science
there much more to do .,science
on the complete other side of it you have an rfid chip implanted in you .,science
this is a little subtle thing .,science
it is a passive device that you use for unlocking a safe with top secret .,science
what is it ?,science
what do you use it for ?,science
whats the story behind it ?,science
i am not the first one .,science
there this whole community of weirdo bio hacker that have done this stuff .,science
and i think one of the early use case wa storing private crypto wallet key and whatever .,science
i dabbled in that a bit and had some fun with it .,science
you have some bitcoin implanted in your body somewhere you can not tell where .,science
it wa the modern day equivalent of finding change in the sofa cushion .,science
after i put some orphan crypto on there that i thought wa worthless and forgot about it for a few year went back and found that some community of people loved it and had propped up the value of it and it had gone up fifty fold .,science
there wa a lot of change in those cushion .,science
thats hilarious .,science
but the primary use case is mostly a a tech demonstrator .,science
it ha my business card on it .,science
you can scan that and by touching it to your phone it open the front door to my house whatever simple stuff .,science
it is a cool step .,science
it is a cool leap to implant something in your body .,science
it ha perhaps thats it is a similar leap to in your link because for a lot of people that notion of putting something inside your body something electronic inside a biological system is a big leap .,science
we have a a mysticism around the barrier of our skin .,science
we are completely fine with knee replacement hip replacement dental implant .,science
but there a mysticism still around the inviolable barrier that the skull represents .,science
and i think that need to be treated any other pragmatic barrier .,science
the question is not how incredible is it to open the skull ?,science
the question is what benefit can we provide ?,science
from all the surgery youve done from everything you understand in the brain how much doe neuroplasticity come into play ?,science
how adaptable is the brain ?,science
for example even in the case of healing from surgery or adapting to the postsurgery situation .,science
the answer that is sad for me and other people of my demographic is that plasticity decrease with age healing decrease with age .,science
i have too much gray hair to be optimistic about that .,science
there are theoretical way to increase plasticity using electrical stimulation nothing that is proven out a a robust enough mechanism to offer widely to people .,science
but yeah i think there cause for optimism that we might find something useful in term of say an implanted electrode that improves learning .,science
certainly there been some amazing work recently from nicholas schiff jonathan baker and others who have a cohort of patient with moderate traumatic brain injury who have had electrode placed in the deep nucleus in the brain called the centromedia nucleus or near centromedia nucleus .,science
and when they apply small amount of electricity to that part of the brain it is almost electronic caffeine .,science
they are able to improve people attention and focus .,science
they are able to improve how people can perform a task .,science
i think in one case someone who wa unable to work after the device wa turned on they were able to get a job .,science
and thats one of the holy grail for me with neuralink and other technology this is from a purely utilitarian standpoint .,science
can we make people able to take care of themselves and their family economically again ?,science
can we make it someone who fully dependent and even maybe requires a lot of caregiver resource can we put them in a position to be fully independent taking care of themselves giving back to their community ?,science
i think thats a very compelling proposition and what motivates a lot of what i do and what a lot of the people at neuralink are working for .,science
it is a cool possibility that if you put a neuralink in there that the brain adapts the other part of the brain adapts too .,science
and it integrates it .,science
the capacity of the brain to do that is interesting probably unknown to the degree to which it can do that .,science
but you are now connecting an external thing to it especially once it is doing stimulation .,science
the biological brain and the electronic brain outside of it working together the possibility they are interesting .,science
it is still unknown but interesting .,science
it feel the brain is good at adapting to whatever .,science
but of course it is a system that by itself is already everything serf a purpose .,science
and you do not want to mess with it too much .,science
it is eliminating a specie from an ecology .,science
you do not know what the delicate interconnection and dependency are .,science
the brain is certainly a delicate complex beast .,science
and we do not know every potential downstream consequence of a single change that we make .,science
do yourself doing we mentioned p1 surgery of p2 p3 p4 p5 more and more and more human ?,science
i think it is a certain brittleness or a failure on the company side if we need me to do all the surgery .,science
i think something that i would very much to work towards is a process that is simple and robust on the surgery side that anyone could do it .,science
we want to get away from requiring intense expertise or intense experience to have this successfully done and make it a simple and translatable a possible .,science
i would love it if every neurosurgeon on the planet had no problem doing this .,science
i think we are probably far from a regulatory environment that would allow people that are not neurosurgeon to do this but not impossible .,science
all ill sign up for that .,science
did you ever anthropomorphize the robot r1 ?,science
do it a a friend thats working together with you ?,science
to a certain degree it is ... or an enemy who going to take the job .,science
to a certain degree it is a complex relationship .,science
all the good relationship are .,science
it is funny when in the middle of the surgery there a part of it where i stand shoulder to shoulder with the robot .,science
if you are in the room reading the body language it is my brotherinarms that are working together on the same problem .,science
yeah i am not threatened by it .,science
keep telling yourself that .,science
how have all the surgery that youve done over the year and the people youve helped and the high stake that youve mentioned how ha that changed your understanding of life and death ?,science
it give you a very visceral sense and this may sound trite but it give you a very visceral sense that death is inevitable .,science
on one hand you are a a neurosurgeon you are deeply involved in these hard to fathom tragedy young parent dying leaving a fouryearold behind to say .,science
and on the other hand it take the sting out of it a bit because how mindnumbingly universal death is .,science
there zero chance that i am going to avoid it .,science
i know technooptimists now and longevity buff now would disagree on that zero.zero estimate but i do not see any chance that our generation is going to avoid it .,science
entropy is a powerful force and we are very ornate delicate brittle dna machine that are not up to the cosmic ray bombardment that we are subjected to .,science
on the one hand every human that ha ever lived died or will die .,science
on the other hand it is one of the hardest thing to imagine inflicting on anyone that you love is having them gone .,science
i am sure youve had friend that are not living anymore and it is hard to even think about them .,science
and i wish i had arrived at the point of nirvana where death doesnt have a sting .,science
i am not worried about it but i can at least say that i am comfortable with the certainty of it if not having found out how to take the tragedy out of it when i think about my kid .,science
either not having me or me not having them or my wife .,science
maybe ive come to accept the intellectual certainty of it but it may be the pain that come with losing the people you love .,science
i do not think ive come to understand the existential aspect of it that this is going to end .,science
and i do not mean in some trite way it certainly feel it is not going to end .,science
you live life it is not going to end .,science
and the fact that this light thats shining this consciousness is going to no longer be at one moment maybe today .,science
it feel me when i am able to load all that in with ernest beckers terror .,science
it is a real fear .,science
i think people are not always honest with how terrifying it is .,science
i think the more you are able to think through it the more terrifying it is .,science
it is not such a simple thing .,science
thats the way life is .,science
if you can load that in it is hard .,science
but i think thats why the stoic did it because it help you get your shit together and be every single moment you are alive is beautiful .,science
and it is terrifying that it is going to end .,science
it is almost you are shivering in the cold a child helpless this feeling .,science
and then it make you when you have warmth when you have the safety when you have the love to appreciate it .,science
i feel sometimes in your position when you mention armor to see death it might make you not be able to see that the finiteness of life .,science
because if you kept looking at that it might break you .,science
it is good to know that you are still struggling with that .,science
there the neurosurgeon and then there a human .,science
and the human is still able to struggle with that and feel the fear of that and the pain of that .,science
yeah it definitely make you ask the question of how many of these can and not say i can not do this anymore .,science
i think it give you an opportunity to appreciate that you are alive today .,science
and ive got three kid and an amazing wife .,science
thing are good .,science
i get to help on a project that i think matter .,science
i think it move u forward .,science
i am a very lucky person .,science
it is the early step of a potentially gigantic leap for humanity .,science
it is a interesting one .,science
and it is cool because you read about all the stuff in history where it is the early day .,science
ive been reading before going to the amazon i would read about explorer that would go and explore even the amazon jungle for the first time .,science
it is those are the early step .,science
or early step into space .,science
early step in any discipline in physic and mathematics .,science
and thats cool because this is on the grand scale these are the early step into diving deep into the human brain .,science
not observing the brain but youll be able to interact with the human brain .,science
it is going to help a lot of people but it also might help u understand what the hell going on in there .,science
i think ultimately we want to give people more lever that they can pull .,science
you want to give people option .,science
if you can give someone a dial that they can turn on how happy they are i think that make people uncomfortable .,science
but now talk about major depressive disorder talk about people that are committing suicide at an alarming rate in this country .,science
try to justify that queasiness in that light .,science
you can give people a knob to take away suicidal ideation suicidal intention .,science
i would give them that knob .,science
i do not know how you justify not doing that .,science
you can think about all the suffering thats going on in the world .,science
every single human being thats suffering now itll be a glowing red dot .,science
the more suffering the more it is glowing and you see the map of human suffering .,science
and any technology that allows you to dim that light of suffering on a grand scale is pretty exciting because there a lot of people suffering and most of them suffer quietly .,science
we look away too often and we should remember those are suffering because once again most of them are suffering quietly .,science
and on a grander scale the fabric of society people have a lot of complaint about how our social fabric is working or not working how our politics is working or not working .,science
those thing are made of neurochemistry too in aggregate .,science
i do not think that lead to a functional society .,science
if you had option for people to moderate that maladaptive behavior there could be huge benefit to society .,science
maybe we could all work together a little more harmoniously toward useful end .,science
there a sweet spot you mentioned .,science
you do not want to completely remove all the dark side of human nature because those are somehow necessary to make the whole thing work but there a sweet spot .,science
you got to suffer a little not much that you lose hope .,science
when you all the surgery youve done have you seen consciousness in there ever ?,science
wa it a glowing light ?,science
i have this sense that i never found it never removed it a dementor in harry potter .,science
i have this sense that consciousness is a lot le magical than our instinct want to claim it is .,science
it seems to me a useful analog for thinking about what consciousness is in the brain is that we have a good intuitive understanding of what it mean to say touch your skin and know whats being touched .,science
i think consciousness is that level of sensory mapping applied to the thought process in the brain itself .,science
what i am saying is consciousness is the sensation of some part of your brain being active .,science
you feel the part of your brain that think of red thing or winged creature or the taste of coffee .,science
you feel those part of your brain being active the way that i am feeling my palm being touched .,science
that sensory system that feel the brain working is consciousness .,science
that is brilliant .,science
it is the same way .,science
it is the sensation of touch when you are touching a thing .,science
consciousness is the sensation of you feeling your brain working your brain thinking your brain perceiving .,science
which is not a warping of spacetime or some quantum field effect .,science
it is nothing magical .,science
people always want to ascribe to consciousness something truly different .,science
there this awesome long history of people looking at whatever the latest discovery in physic is to explain consciousness because it is the most magical the most out there thing that you can think of .,science
people always want to do that with consciousness .,science
i do not think thats necessary .,science
it is a very useful and gratifying way of feeling your brain work .,science
and a we said it is one heck of a brain .,science
everything we see around u everything we love everything thats beautiful came from brain these .,science
it is all electrical activity happening inside your skull .,science
and i for one am grateful that there people you that are exploring all the way that it work and all the way it can be made better .,science
thanks lex .,science
thank you much for talking today .,science
thanks for listening to this conversation with matthew mcdougal .,science
and now dear friend here bliss chapman brain interface software lead at neuralink .,science
you told me that youve met hundred of people with spinal cord injury or with al and that your motivation for helping at neuralink is grounded and wanting to help them .,science
can you describe this motivation ?,science
first a thank you to all the people ive got a chance to speak with for sharing their story with me .,science
i do not think there any world in which i can share their story a powerful a way a they can .,science
but i think to summarize at a very high level what i hear over and over again is that people with al or severe spinal cord injury in a place where they can not move physically anymore at the end of the day are looking for independence .,science
and that can mean different thing for different people .,science
for some folk it can mean the ability to be able to communicate again independently without needing to wear something on their face without needing a caretaker to be able to put something in their mouth .,science
and for some folk it is a simple a being able to respond to the kid in time before they run away or get interested in something else .,science
and these are deeply personal and very human problem .,science
and what strike me again and again when talking with these folk is that this is an engineering problem .,science
this is a problem that with the resource with the team we can make a lot of progress on .,science
and at the end of the day i think thats a deeply inspiring message and something that make me excited to get up every day .,science
it is both an engineering problem in term of a bci for example that can give them capability where they can interact with the world .,science
but also on the other side it is an engineering problem for the rest of the world to make it more accessible for people living with quadriplegia .,science
and i see ill take a broad view lens on this for a second .,science
i think i am very in favor of anyone working in this problem space .,science
beyond bci i am happy and excited and willing to support any way i can folk working on eye tracking system working on speech to text system working on head tracker or mouse stick or quad stick .,science
i havent met many engineer and folk in the community that do exactly those thing .,science
and i think for the people we are trying to help it doesnt matter what the complexity of the solution is a long a the problem is solved .,science
and i want to emphasize that there can be many solution out there that can help with these problem .,science
and bci is one of a collection of such solution .,science
bci in particular i think offer several advantage here .,science
and i think the folk that recognize this immediately are usually the people who have spinal cord injury or some form of paralysis .,science
usually you do not have to explain to them why this might be something that could be helpful .,science
it is usually pretty selfevident .,science
but for the rest of u folk that do not live with severe spinal cord injury or who do not know somebody with al it is not often obvious why you would want a brain implant to be able to connect and navigate a computer .,science
and it is surprisingly nuanced .,science
and to the degree that ive learned a huge amount working with noland in the first neuriline clinical trial and understanding from him in his word why this device is impactful for him .,science
and it is a nuanced topic .,science
it can be the case that even if you can achieve the same thing for example with a mouse stick when navigating a computer he doesnt have access to that mouse stick every single minute of the day .,science
he only ha access when someone is available to put it in front of him .,science
and bci can offer a level of independence and autonomy that if it wasnt physically part of your body it would be hard to achieve in any other way .,science
there a lot of fascinating aspect to what it take to get noland to be able to control a cursor on the screen with his mind .,science
you texted me something that i love .,science
you said i wa part of the team that interviewed and selected p1 .,science
i wa in the operating room during the first human surgery monitoring live signal coming out of the brain .,science
i work with the user every day to develop new ux paradigm decoding strategy .,science
and i wa part of the team that figured out how to recover useful bci to new world record level when the signal quality degraded .,science
well talk about i think every aspect of that but zooming out what wa it to be part of that part of that team and part of that historic i would say historic first ?,science
yeah i think for me this is something ive been excited about for close to ten year now .,science
and to be able to be even some small part of making it a reality is extremely exciting .,science
a couple maybe special moment during that whole process that ill never truly forget .,science
one of them is entering the actual surgery .,science
at that point in time i know noland quite .,science
i know his family .,science
and i think the initial reaction when noland is rolled into the operating room is shit reaction .,science
but at that point most of memory kick in and you go into you let your body do all the talking .,science
and i have the lucky job in that particular procedure to be in charge of monitoring the implant .,science
my job is to sit there to look at the signal coming off the implant to look at the live brain data streaming off the device a thread are being inserted into the brain .,science
and to observe and make sure that nothing is going wrong or that there no red flag or fault condition that we need to go and investigate or pause the surgery to debug .,science
and because i had that spectator view of the surgery i had a slightly removed perspective and i think most folk in the room i got to sit there and think to myself wow that brain is moving a lot .,science
when you look into the side of the craniectomy that we stick the thread in one thing that most people do not realize is the brain move .,science
the brain move a lot when you breathe when your heart beat and you can see it visibly .,science
thats something that i think wa a surprise to me and very very exciting to be able to see someone brain who you physically know and have talked with that length pulsing and moving inside their skull .,science
and they used that brain to talk to you previously .,science
and now it is there moving .,science
i did not realize that in term of the thread sending the neural link implant is active during surgery .,science
and one thread at a time you are able to start seeing the signal .,science
thats part of the way you test that the thing is working .,science
yeah in the operating room after we finished all the thread insertion i started collecting whats called broadband data .,science
broadband is the most raw form of signal you can collect from a neural link electrode .,science
it is essentially a measurement of the local field potential or the voltage essentially measured by that electrode .,science
and we have a certain mode in our application that allows u to visualize where detected spike are .,science
it visualizes where in the broadband signal in it very very raw form of the data a neuron is spiking .,science
and one of the these moment that ill never forget a part of this whole clinical trial is seeing live in the operating room while he still under anesthesia beautiful spike being shown in the application streaming live to a device i am holding in my hand .,science
this is no signal processing the raw data and then the signal processing on top of it you are seeing the spike detected. . yeah .,science
and thats the ux too .,science
because that look beautiful a . during that procedure there wa a lot of camera men in the room .,science
they also were curious and wanted to see there several neurosurgeon in the room who are all excited to see robot taking their job .,science
and they are all crowded around and small little iphone watching this live brain data stream out of his brain .,science
what wa that seeing the robot do some of the surgery .,science
the computer vision aspect where it detects all the spot that avoid the blood vessel and then obviously with human supervision then doing the high precision connection of the thread to the brain .,science
yeah thats a good question .,science
my answer is going to be pretty lame here but it wa boring .,science
ive seen it many time .,science
thats exactly how you want surgery to be .,science
you want it to be boring .,science
because ive seen it many time .,science
ive seen the robot do this surgery hundred of time .,science
and it wa one more time .,science
all the practice surgery and proxy .,science
and this is another day .,science
what about when nolan woke up ?,science
do you remember a moment where he wa able to move the cursor not move the cursor but get signal from the brain such that it wa able to show that there a connection ?,science
we are quite excited to move a quickly a we can .,science
and nolan wa excited to get started .,science
he wanted to get started the day of surgery but we waited till the next morning very patiently .,science
and the next morning in the icu where he wa recovering he wanted to get started and start to understand what signal we can measure from his brain .,science
and maybe for folk who are not familiar with the neuralink system we implant the neuralink system or the neuralink implant in the motor cortex .,science
the motor cortex is responsible for representing thing motor intent .,science
if you imagine closing and opening your hand that signal representation would be present in the motor cortex .,science
if you imagine moving your arm back and forth or wiggling a pinky this signal can be present in the motor cortex .,science
one of the way we start to map out what signal do we have access to in any particular individual brain is through this task called body mapping .,science
and body mapping is where you essentially present a visual to the user and you say hey imagine doing this .,science
and the visual is a 3d hand opening closing or index finger modulating up and down .,science
and you ask the user to imagine that .,science
and obviously you can not see them do this because they are paralyzed .,science
you can not see them move their arm .,science
but while they do this task you can record neural activity .,science
and you can offline model and check can i predict or can i detect the modulation corresponding with those different action ?,science
and we did that task and we realized hey there some modulation associated with some of his hand motion which wa the first indication that we can potentially use that modulation to do useful thing in the world .,science
and he started playing with it the first time we showed him it .,science
and we took the same live view of his brain activity and put it in front of him .,science
and we said hey you tell u whats going on .,science
we are not you you are able to imagine different thing .,science
and we know that it is modulating some of these neuron .,science
you figure out for u what that is representing .,science
and he played with it for a bit .,science
he played for a bit longer .,science
and he said when i move this finger i see this particular neuron start to fire more .,science
and i said prove it do it again .,science
and he said three two one boom .,science
and the minute he moved you can see instantaneously this neuron is firing single neuron i can tell you the exact channel number if you are interested it is stuck in my brain now forever .,science
but that single channel firing wa a beautiful indication that it wa behaviorally modulated neural activity that could then be used for downstream task decoding a computer cursor .,science
and when you say single channel is that associated with a single electrode ?,science
yeah channel electrode are interchangeable .,science
and there a one thousand and twenty four of those .,science
one thousand and twenty four .,science
it is incredible that that work .,science
that when i wa learning about all this and loading it in it wa blowing my mind that the intention you can visualize yourself moving the finger that can turn into a signal .,science
and the fact that you can then skip that step and visualize the cursor moving or have the intention of the cursor moving in that leading to a signal that can then be used to move the cursor .,science
there are many exciting thing there to learn about the brain about the way the brain work .,science
the very fact of their existing signal that can be used a powerful .,science
but it feel thats the beginning of figuring out how that signal could be used effectively .,science
i should also there many fascinating detail here but you mentioned the body mapping step at least in the version i saw that nolan wa showing off .,science
there a super nice interface a graphical interface .,science
it felt i wa in the future because it i guess it visualizes you moving the hand .,science
and there a very a sexy polished interface that say hello .,science
i do not know if there a voice component but it felt when you wake up in a nice video game and this is a tutorial at the beginning of that video game this is what you are supposed to do .,science
it is cool .,science
no the future should feel the future .,science
but it is not easy to pull that off .,science
it need to be simple but not too simple .,science
and i think the ux design component here is underrated for pci development in general .,science
there a whole interaction effect between the way in which you visualize an instruction to the user and the kind of signal you can get back .,science
and that quality of your behavioral alignment to the neural signal is a function of how good you are at expressing to the user what you want them to do .,science
and yeah we spend a lot of time thinking about the ux of how we build our application of how the decoder function the control surface it provides to the user all these little detail matter a lot .,science
maybe itd be nice to get into a little bit more detail of what the signal look and what the decoding look .,science
there a n1 implant that ha we mentioned one thousand and twenty four electrode .,science
and thats collecting raw data raw signal .,science
what doe that signal look ?,science
and what are the different step along the way before it is transmitted ?,science
and what is transmitted and all that stuff ?,science
this is going to be a fun one .,science
maybe before diving into what we do it is worth understanding what we are trying to measure because that dictate a lot of the requirement for the system that we build .,science
and what we are trying to measure is individual neuron producing action potential .,science
and action potential is you can think of it a little electrical impulse that you can detect if you are close enough .,science
and by being close enough within let say one hundred micron of that cell .,science
and one hundred micron is a very very tiny distance .,science
and the number of neuron that you can pick up with any given electrode is a small radius around that electrode .,science
and the other thing worth understanding about the underlying biology here is that when neuron produce an action potential the width of that action potential is about one millisecond .,science
from the start of the spike to the end of the spike that whole width of that characteristic feature of a neuron firing is one millisecond wide .,science
and if you want to detect that an individual spike is occurring or not you need to sample that signal or sample the local field potential nearby that neuron much more frequently than once a millisecond .,science
you need to sample many many time per millisecond to be able to detect that this is the characteristic waveform of a neuron producing an action potential .,science
and we sample across all one thousand and twenty four electrode about twentyzero time a second .,science
twentyzero time a second mean we are already given one millisecond window .,science
we have about twenty sample that tell u what that exact shape of that action potential look .,science
and once weve sampled at super high rate the underlying electrical field nearby these cell we can process that signal into where do we detect a spike or where do we not ?,science
a binary signal one or zero do we detect a spike in this one millisecond or not ?,science
and we do that because the actual information carrying subspace of neural activity is when are spike occurring ?,science
essentially everything that we care about for decoding can be captured or represented in the frequency characteristic of spike train meaning how often are spike firing in any given window of time .,science
and that allows u to do a crazy amount of compression from this very rich high density signal to something thats much much more sparse and compressible that can be sent out over a wireless radio a bluetooth communication for example .,science
quick tangent here .,science
there a local neighborhood of neuron nearby .,science
how difficult doe it to isolate from where the spike came from ?,science
there a whole field of academic neuroscience work on exactly this problem of giving a single electrode or giving a set of electrode measuring a set of neuron .,science
how can you sort spike sort which spike are coming from what neuron ?,science
and this is a problem thats pursued in academic work because you care about it for understanding whats going on in the underlying neuroscience of the brain .,science
if you care about understanding how the brain are presenting information how thats evolving through time then thats a very very important question to understand .,science
for the engineering side of thing at least at the current scale if the number of neuron per electrode is relatively small you can get away with ignoring that problem completely .,science
you can think of it a random projection of neuron to electrode .,science
and there may be in some case more than one neuron per electrode .,science
but if that number is small enough those signal can be thought of a a union of the two .,science
and for many application thats a reasonable trade off to make and can simplify the problem a lot .,science
and a you scale out channel count the relevance of distinguishing individual neuron becomes le important because you have more overall signal and you can start to rely on correlation or covariant structure in the data to help understand when that channel is firing what doe that represent ?,science
because that when that channel is firing in concert with these other fifty channel that mean move left .,science
but when that same channel is firing with concert with these other ten channel that mean move .,science
you have to do this spike detection on board .,science
and you have to do that super efficiently .,science
fast and not use too much power because you do not want to be generating too much heat .,science
that to be a super simple signal processing step .,science
is there some wisdom you can share about what it take to overcome that challenge ?,science
weve tried many different version of turning this raw signal into a feature that you might want to send off the device .,science
and ill say that i do not think we are at the final step of this process .,science
this is a long journey .,science
we have something that work clearly today .,science
but there can be many approach that we find in the future that are much better than what we do now .,science
some version of what we do now .,science
and there a lot of academic heritage to these idea .,science
i do not want to claim that these are original neuralink idea or anything that .,science
but one of these idea is to build a a convolutional filter almost if you will that slide across the signal and look for a certain template to be matched .,science
and that template consists of how deep the spike modulates how much it recovers and what the duration and window of time is that the whole process take .,science
and if you can see in the signal that that template is matched within certain bound then you can say thats a spike .,science
one reason that approach is super convenient is that you can implement that extremely efficiently in hardware which mean that you can run it in low power across onetwenty four channel at once .,science
another approach that weve recently started exploring and this can be combined with the spike detection approach something called spike band power .,science
you might be able to pick up population level activity of thing that are maybe slightly outside the normal recording radius what neuroscientist sometimes refer to a the hash of activity the other stuff thats going on .,science
and you can look at across many channel how that background noise is behaving you might be able to get more juice out of the signal that way .,science
but it come at a cost that signal is now a floating point representation which mean it is more expensive to send out over a power .,science
it mean you have to find different way to compress it that are different than what you can apply to binary signal .,science
there a lot of different challenge associated with these different modality .,science
also in term of communication you are limited by the amount of data you can send .,science
and and also because you are currently using the bluetooth protocol you have to batch stuff together .,science
but you have to also do this keeping the latency crazy low crazy low .,science
anything to say about the latency ?,science
yeah this is a passion project of mine .,science
i want to build the best mouse in the world .,science
i do not want to build the the chevrolet spark or whatever of electric car .,science
i want to build the tesla roadster version of a mouse .,science
and i do think it is quite possible that within five to ten year that most esports competition are dominated by people with paralysis .,science
this is a very real possibility for a number of reason .,science
one is that theyll have access to the best technology to play video game effectively .,science
the second is they have the time to do .,science
those two factor together are particularly potent for esport competitor .,science
unless people without paralysis are also allowed to implant your own .,science
which is it is another way to interact with a digital device .,science
it is definitely the case that you have a higher ceiling performance .,science
you because you do not have to buffer your intention through your arm through your muscle you get by nature of having a brain implant at all seventy five millisecond lead time on any action that you are trying to take .,science
and there some nuance to this there evidence that the motor cortex you can plan out sequence of action .,science
you may not get that whole benefit all the time .,science
but for a reaction time style game where you want to somebody over here snipe them that thing you do have an inherent advantage because you do not need to go through muscle .,science
the question is how much faster can you make it ?,science
and we are already faster than what you would do if you are going through muscle from a latency point of view .,science
and we are in the early stage of that i think we can push it our end to end latency now from brain spike to cursor movement it is about twenty two millisecond .,science
if you think about the best mouse in the world the best gaming mouse thats about five millisecond ish of latency depending on how you measure depending how fast your screen refreshes there a lot of characteristic that matter there .,science
but yeah and the rough time for a neuron in the brain to impact your command of your hand is about seventy five millisecond .,science
if you look at those number you can see that we are already competitive and slightly faster than what youd get by moving your moving your hand .,science
yeah a opposed to weve gotten used to that latency that natural latency that happens .,science
is the currently the bottleneck to communication ?,science
the bluetooth communication is that whats the actual bottleneck ?,science
there always going to be a bottleneck but whats the current bottleneck ?,science
yeah a couple thing .,science
hilariously bluetooth low energy protocol ha some restriction on how fast you can communicate .,science
the protocol itself establishes a standard of the most frequent update you can send are on the order of seven.five millisecond .,science
and a we push latency down to the level of individual spike impacting control that level of resolution that protocol is going to become a limiting factor at some scale .,science
another important nuance to this is that it is not the neural link itself thats part of this equation .,science
if you start pushing latency below the level of how fast screen refresh then you have another problem .,science
you need your whole system to be able to be a reactive a the limit of what the technology can offer .,science
you need the screen one hundred and twenty hertz doesnt work anymore if you are trying to have something respond at something thats at the level of one millisecond .,science
thats a cool challenge .,science
i also that for a tshirt the best mouse in the world .,science
tell me on the receiving end the decoding step .,science
now we figured out what the spike are weve got them all together now we are sending that over to the app .,science
whats the decoding step look ?,science
maybe first what is decoding ?,science
i think there probably a lot of folk listening that have no clue what what it mean to decode brand nativity .,science
even if we zoom out beyond that what is the app ?,science
there an implant thats wirelessly communicating with any digital device that ha an app installed .,science
maybe can you tell me at high level what the app is what the software is outside of the brain ?,science
maybe working backwards from the goal the goal is to help someone with paralysis in this case nolan be able to navigate his computer independently .,science
and we think the best way to do that is to offer them the same tool that we have to navigate our software because we do not want to have to rebuild an entire software ecosystem for the brain at least not yet .,science
and the job of the application is to translate this wireless stream of brain data coming off the implant into control of the computer .,science
and we do that by essentially building a mapping from brain activity to the hid input to the actual hardware .,science
hid is the protocol for communicating input device event .,science
for example move mouse to this position or press this key down .,science
and that mapping is fundamentally what the app is responsible for .,science
but there a lot of nuance of how that mapping work that we spend a lot of time to try to get .,science
and we are still in the early stage of a long journey to figure out how to do that optimally .,science
one part of that process is decoding .,science
decoding is this process of taking the statistical pattern of brain data thats being channeled across this bluetooth connection to the application and turning it into for example the mouse movement .,science
and that decoding step you can think of it in a couple of different part .,science
similar to any machine learning problem there a training step and there an inference step .,science
the training step in our case is a very intricate behavioral process where the user ha to imagine doing different action .,science
for example theyll be presented a screen with a cursor on it and theyll be asked to push that cursor to the .,science
then imagine pushing that cursor to the left push it up push it down .,science
and we can build up a pattern or using any modern ml method of mapping of given this brain data and then imagine behavior map one to the other .,science
and then at test time you take that same pattern matching system .,science
in our case it is a deep neural network and you run it and you take the live stream of brain data coming off their implant you decode it by pattern matching to what you saw at calibration time and you use that for control of the computer .,science
now a couple of rabbit hole that i think are quite interesting one of them ha to do with how you build that best template matching system because there a variety of behavioral challenge and also debugging challenge when you are working with someone who paralyzed .,science
because again fundamentally you do not observe what they are trying to do .,science
you can not see them attempt to move their hand .,science
and you have to figure out a way to instruct the user to do something and validate that they are doing it correctly such that then you can downstream build with confidence the mapping between the neural spike and the intended action .,science
and by doing the action correctly what i mean is at this level of resolution of what neuron are doing .,science
if in ideal world you could get a signal of behavioral intent that is ground truth accurate at the scale of one millisecond resolution then with high confidence i could build a mapping from my neural spike to that behavioral intention .,science
but the challenge is again that you do not observe what they are doing .,science
and there a lot of nuance to how you build user experience that give you more than a course on average correct representation of what the user is intending to do .,science
if you want to build the world best mouse you want it to be a responsive a possible .,science
you want it to be able to do exactly what the user is intending at every step along the way not on average be correct when you are trying to move it from left to .,science
and building a behavioral calibration game or software experience that give you that level of resolution is what we spend a lot of time working .,science
the calibration process the interface ha to encourage precision meaning whatever it doe it should be super intuitive that the next thing the human is going to likely do is exactly that intention that you need and only that intention .,science
and you do not have any feedback except that may be speaking to you afterwards what they did .,science
thats fundamentally that is a exciting ux challenge because thats all on the ux .,science
it is not about being friendly or nice or usable .,science
user experience is how it work .,science
it is how it work for the calibration and calibration at least at this stage of neuralink is fundamental to the operation of the thing .,science
and not calibration but continued calibration essentially .,science
and maybe you said something that i think is worth exploring there a little bit .,science
you said it is primarily a ux challenge .,science
and i think a large component of it is but there is also a very interesting machine learning challenge here which is given some data set including some on average correct behavior of asking the user to move up or move down move move left .,science
and given a data set of neural spike is there a way to infer in some semisupervised or entirely unsupervised way what that high resolution version of their intention is ?,science
and if you think about it there probably is because there are enough data point in the data set enough constraint on your model that there should be a way with the formulation to let the model figure out itself .,science
for example at this millisecond this is exactly how hard they are pushing upwards .,science
and at this millisecond this is how hard they are trying to push upwards .,science
it is important to have very clean label .,science
the problem because much harder from the machine learning perspective the label are noisy .,science
thats correct .,science
and then to get the clean label thats a ux challenge .,science
although clean label i think maybe it is worth exploring what that exactly mean .,science
i think any given labeling strategy will have some number of assumption it make about what the user is attempting to do .,science
those assumption can be formulated in a loss function or they can be formulated in term of heuristic that you might use to try to estimate or guesstimate what the user is trying to do .,science
and what matter is how accurate those assumption .,science
for example you might say hey user push upwards and follow the speed of this cursor .,science
and your heuristic might be that they are trying to do it exactly what that cursor is trying to do .,science
another competing heuristic might be they are trying to go slightly faster at the beginning of the movement and slightly slower at the end .,science
and those competing heuristic may or may not be accurate reflection of what the user is trying to do .,science
another version of the task might be hey user imagine moving this cursor a fixed offset .,science
rather than follow the cursor try to move it exactly two hundred pixel to the .,science
here the cursor here the target .,science
cursor disappears try to move that now invisible cursor two hundred pixel to the .,science
and the assumption in that case would be that the user can modulate correctly that position offset .,science
but that position offset assumption might be a weaker assumption .,science
and therefore potentially you can make it more accurate than these heuristic that are trying to guesstimate at each millisecond what the user is trying to do .,science
you can imagine different task that make different assumption about the nature of the user intention .,science
and those assumption being correct is what i would think of a a clean label .,science
for that step what are we supposed to be visualizing ?,science
there a cursor .,science
and you want to move that cursor to the or the left up and down or maybe move them by a certain offset .,science
thats one way .,science
is that the best way to do calibration ?,science
is that or is it is that not an effective way for initial calibration ?,science
yeah great question .,science
there a lot to unpack there .,science
the first thing i would draw a distinction between is open loop first close loop .,science
open loop what by that is the user is going from zero to one they have no model at all and they are trying to get to the place where they have some level of control at all .,science
in that setup you need to have some task that give the user a hint of what you want them to do such that you can build it mapping again from brain data to output .,science
then once they have a model you could imagine them using that model and adapting to it and figuring out the way to use it themselves and then retraining on that data to give you a boost in performance .,science
there a lot of challenge associated with both of these technique and we can wrap it all into both of them if you are interested but the challenge with the open loop task is that the user themselves doesnt get proprioceptive feedback about what they are doing .,science
they do not necessarily perceive themselves or feel the mouse under their hand when they are using an open loop when they are trying to do an open loop calibration .,science
they are being asked to perform something imagine if you had your whole arm numbed and you stuck it in a box and you couldnt see it .,science
you had no visual feedback and you had no proprioceptive feedback about what the position or activity of your arm wa .,science
now you are asked given this thing on the screen thats moving from left to match that speed .,science
you can try your best to invoke whatever that imagined action is in your brain thats moving the cursor from left to but in any situation you are going to be inaccurate and maybe inconsistent in how you do that task .,science
thats the fundamental challenge of open loop .,science
the challenge with closed loop is that once the user given a model and they are able to start moving the mouse on their own they are going to very naturally adapt to that model .,science
and that coadaptation between the model learning what they are doing and the user learning how to use the model may not find you the best global minimum .,science
maybe that your first model wa noisy in some way or maybe had some quirk .,science
there some part of the data distribution that did not cover super and the user now figure out because they are a brilliant user no one they figured out the sequence of imagined motion or the angle they have to hold their hand at to get it to work .,science
and theyll get it to work great but then the next day they come back to their device and maybe they do not remember exactly all the trick that they used in the previous day .,science
and there a complicated feedback cycle here that can emerge and can make it a very very difficult debugging process .,science
there a lot of fascinating thing there .,science
yeah to stay on the closed loop .,science
ive seen situation this happened watching psychology grad student they use piece of software when they do not know how to program themselves they use piece of software that somebody else wrote and it ha a bunch of bug .,science
and they figure out and theyve been using it for year they figure out way to work around that happens .,science
nobody considers maybe we should fix this they adapt .,science
and thats a interesting notion that we are good at adapting but you need to still that might not be the optimal .,science
how do you solve that problem ?,science
do you have to restart from scratch every once in a while thing ?,science
yeah it is a good question .,science
first and foremost i would say this is not a solve problem .,science
and for anyone who listening in academia who work on bcis i would also say this is not a problem thats solved by simply scaling channel count .,science
this is maybe that can help when you can get richer covariant structure that you can use to exploit when trying to come up with good labeling strategy .,science
but if you are interested in problem that are not going to be solved inherently by scaling channel count this is one of them .,science
yeah how do you solve it ?,science
it is not a solve problem .,science
thats the first thing i want to make sure it get across .,science
the second thing is any solution that involves closed loop is going to become a very difficult debugging problem .,science
and one of my general heuristic for choosing what problem to tackle is that you want to choose the one thats going to be the easiest to debug .,science
because if you can do that even if the ceiling is lower you are going to be able to move faster because you have a tighter iteration loop debugging the problem .,science
and in the open loop setting there not a feedback cycle to debug with the user in the loop .,science
and there some reason to think that that should be an easier debugging problem .,science
the other thing thats worth understanding is that even in a closed loop setting there no special software magic of how to infer what the user is truly attempting to do .,science
in the closed loop setting although they are moving the cursor on the screen they may be attempting something different than what your model is outputting .,science
what the model is outputting is not a signal that you can use to retrain if you want to be able to improve the model further .,science
you still have this very complicated guesstimation or unsupervised problem of figuring out what is the true user intention underlying that signal .,science
and the open loop problem ha the nice property of being easy to debug .,science
and the second nice property of it ha all the same information and content a a closed loop scenario .,science
another thing i want to mention and call out is that this problem doesnt need to be solved in order to give useful control to people .,science
even today with the solution we have now and that academia ha built up over decade the level of control that can be given to a user today is quite useful .,science
it doesnt need to be solved to get to that level of control .,science
but again i want to build the world best mouse .,science
i want to make it good that it is not even a question that you want it .,science
and to build the world best mouse the superhuman version you need to nail that problem .,science
and a couple maybe detail of previous study that weve done internally that i think are very interesting to understand when thinking about how to solve this problem .,science
you can imagine building a data set of whats going on in the brain and what is the mouse exactly doing on the table .,science
and it turn out that if you build the mapping from neurospikes to predict exactly what the mouse is doing that model will perform worse than a model that is trained to predict higher level assumption about what the user might be trying to do .,science
for example assuming that the monkey is trying to go in a straight line to the target .,science
it turn out that making those assumption is more effective in producing a model than predicting the underlying hand movement .,science
the intention not the physical movement or whatever .,science
there obviously a very strong correlation between the two but the intention is a more powerful thing to be chasing .,science
thats also super interesting .,science
the intention itself is fascinating because yes with the bci here in this case with the digital telepathy you are acting on the intention not the action which is why there an experience of feeling it is happening before you meant for it to happen .,science
that is cool .,science
and that is why you could achieve superhuman performance probably in term of the control of the mouse .,science
for open loop to clarify whenever the person is tasked to move the mouse to the you said there not feedback .,science
they do not get to get that satisfaction of getting it to move. ?,science
you could imagine giving the user feedback on a screen but it is difficult because at this point you do not know what they are attempting to do .,science
what can you show them that would give them a signal of i am doing this correctly or not correctly ?,science
let take this very specific example .,science
maybe your calibration task look you are trying to move the cursor a certain position offset .,science
your instruction to the user are hey the cursor here .,science
now when the cursor disappears imagine moving it two hundred pixel from where it wa to the to be over this target .,science
in that scenario you could imagine coming up with some consistency metric that you could display to the user of i know what the spike train look on average when you do this action to the .,science
maybe i can produce some probabilistic estimate of how likely is that to be the action you took given the latest trial or trajectory that you imagined .,science
and that could give the user some feedback of how consistent are they across different trial .,science
you could also imagine that if the user is prompted with that consistency metric that maybe they become more behaviorally engaged to begin with because the task is boring when you do not have any feedback at all .,science
and there may be benefit to the the user experience of showing something on the screen even if it is not accurate because it keep the user motivated to try to increase that number or push it upwards .,science
there a psychology element here .,science
yeah absolutely .,science
and again all of that is ux challenge .,science
how much signal drift is there ?,science
hour to hour day to day week to week month to month how often do you have to recalibrate because of the signal drift ?,science
this is a problem weve worked on both with nhp nonhuman primate before our clinical trial and then also with noland during the clinical trial .,science
maybe the first thing thats worth stating is what the goal is here .,science
the goal is to enable the user to have a plug and play experience where i guess they do not have to plug anything in but a play experience where they can use the device whenever they want to however they want to .,science
and thats what we are aiming for .,science
and there can be a set of solution that get to that state without considering this nonstationarity problem .,science
maybe the first solution here thats important is that they can recalibrate whenever they want .,science
this is something that noland ha the ability to do today .,science
he can recalibrate the system at 2am in the middle of the night without his caretaker or parent or friend around to help push a button for him .,science
the other important part of the solution is that when you have a good model calibrated that you can continue using that without needing to recalibrate it .,science
how often he ha to do this recalibration today depends on his appetite for performance .,science
there are we observe a a degradation through time of how any individual model work but this can be mitigated behaviorally by the user adapting their control strategy .,science
it can also be mitigated through a combination of software feature that we provide to the user .,science
for example we let the user adjust exactly how fast the cursor is moving .,science
we call that the gain for example the gain of how fast the cursor reacts to any given input intention .,science
they can also adjust the smoothing how smooth the output of that cursor intention is .,science
they can also adjust the friction which is how easy it is it to stop and hold still .,science
and all these software tool allow the user a great deal of flexibility and troubleshooting mechanism to be able to solve this problem for themselves .,science
all this is done by looking to the side of the screen selecting the mixer and the mixer you have it is dj mode .,science
it is a done interface .,science
and yeah there that bias that there a cursor drift that nolan talked about in a stream .,science
although he said that you guy were playing around with it with him and they are constantly improving .,science
that could have been a snapshot of that particular moment a particular day .,science
but he said that there wa this cursor drift and this bias that could be removed by him i guess looking to the side of the screen the left side of the screen to adjust the bias .,science
thats one interface action i guess to adjust the bias .,science
this is an idea that come out of academia .,science
there wa some prior work with brain gate clinical trial participant where they pioneered this idea of bias correction .,science
bias maybe for people who are not familiar is what is the default motion of the cursor if you are imagining nothing .,science
and it turn out that thats one of the first qualia of the cursor control experience thats impacted by neuron nonstationarity .,science
quality of the cursor experience .,science
i do not know how else to describe it .,science
i am not the guy moving .,science
it is poetic .,science
the quality of the cursor experience .,science
yeah it is not poetic but it is deeply true .,science
there is an experience when it work it is a joyful a pleasant experience .,science
and when it doesnt work it is a very frustrating experience .,science
thats the art of ux .,science
it is you have the possibility to frustrate people or the possibility to give them joy .,science
and at the end of the day it is truly the case that ux is how the thing work .,science
and it is not whats shown on the screen .,science
it is also what control surface doe a decoder provide the user ?,science
we want them to feel they are in the f1 car not some minivan ?,science
and thats truly is how we think about it .,science
nolan himself is an f1 fan .,science
we refer to ourselves a a pit crew .,science
he is truly the f1 driver .,science
and there different control surface that different kind of car and airplane provide the user .,science
and we take a lot of inspiration from that when designing how the cursor should behave .,science
and what maybe one nuance of this is even detail when you move a mouse on a macbook trackpad the response curve of how that input that you give the trackpad translates to cursor movement is different than how it work with a mouse .,science
when you move on the trackpad there a different response function a different curve to how much a movement translates to input to the computer than when you do it physically with a mouse .,science
and thats because somebody sat down a long time ago when they are designing the initial input system to any computer and they thought through exactly how it feel to use these different system .,science
and now we are designing the next generation of this input system to a computer which is entirely done via the brain .,science
and there no purpose of the feedback .,science
again you do not feel the mouse in your hand .,science
you do not feel the key under your fingertip .,science
and you want a control surface that still make it easy and intuitive for the user to understand the state of the system and how to achieve what they want to achieve .,science
and ultimately the end goal is that that ux is completely it fade into the background it becomes something thats natural and intuitive that it is subconscious to the user .,science
and they should feel they have direct control over the cursor doe what they want it to do .,science
they are not thinking about the implementation of how to make it do what they want it to do .,science
it is doing what they want it to do .,science
is there some thing along the line of fitts law where you should move the mouse in a certain way that maximizes your chance to hit the target ?,science
i do not even know what i am asking but i am hoping the intention of my question will land on a profound answer .,science
is there some understanding of the law of ux when it come to the context of somebody using their brain to control it ?,science
thats different than actual with a mouse ?,science
i think we are in the early stage of discovering those law .,science
i wouldnt claim to have solved that problem yet .,science
but there definitely some thing weve learned that make it easier for the user to get stuff done .,science
and it is pretty straightforward when you verbalize it but it take a while to get to that point when you are in the process of debugging the stuff in the trench .,science
one of those thing is that any machine learning system that you build ha some number of error .,science
and it matter how those error translate to the downstream user experience .,science
for example if you are developing a search algorithm in your photo if you search for your friend joe and it pull up a photo of your friend josephine maybe thats not a big deal because the cost of an error is not that high .,science
in a different scenario where you are trying to detect insurance fraud or something this and you are directly sending someone to court because of some machine learning model output then the error make a lot more sense to be careful about .,science
you want to be very thoughtful about how those error translate to downstream effect .,science
the same a true in bci .,science
for example if you are building a model thats decoding a velocity output from the brain versus an output where you are trying to modulate the left click for example these have different tradeoff of how precise you need to be before it becomes useful to the end user .,science
for velocity it is to be on average correct because the output of the model is integrated through time .,science
if the user is trying to click at position a and they are currently in position b they are trying to navigate over time to get between those two point .,science
and a long a the output of the model is on average correct they can steer through time with the user control in the mix they can get to the point they want to get to .,science
the same is not true of a click .,science
for a click you are performing it almost instantly at the scale of neuron firing .,science
and you want to be very sure that that click is correct because a false click can be very destructive to the user .,science
they might accidentally close the tab that they are trying to do something and lose all their progress .,science
they might accidentally hit some send button on some text that is only half composed and read funny after .,science
there different cost function associated with error in this space .,science
and part of the ux design is understanding how to build a solution that is when it is wrong still useful to the end user .,science
thats fascinating that assigning cost to every action when an error occurs .,science
every action if an error occurs ha a certain cost .,science
and incorporating that into how you interpret the intention mapping it to the action is important .,science
i did not quite until you said it realize there a cost to sending the text early .,science
it is a very expensive cost .,science
it is super annoying .,science
if you accidentally if you are a cursor imagine if your cursor misclicked every once in a while .,science
thats super obnoxious .,science
and the worst part of it is usually when the user is trying to click they are also holding still because they are over the target they want to hit and they are getting ready to click .,science
which mean that in the data set that we build on average is the case that low speed or desired to hold still is correlated with when the user is attempting to click .,science
wow that is fascinating .,science
it is also not the case people think that a click is a binary signal .,science
this must be super easy to decode .,science
yes it is .,science
but the bar is much higher for it to become a useful thing for the user .,science
and there way to solve this .,science
you can take the compound approach of let give the let take five second to click .,science
let take a huge window of time we can be very confident about the answer .,science
but again world best mouse .,science
the world best mouse doesnt take a second to click or five hundred millisecond to click .,science
it take five millisecond to click or le .,science
and if you are aiming for that high bar then you want to solve the underlying problem .,science
maybe this is a good place to ask about how to measure performance this whole bit per second .,science
what can you explain what you mean by that ?,science
maybe a good place to start is to talk about webgrid a a game a a good illustration of the measurement of performance ?,science
maybe ill take one zoom out step there which is explaining why we care to measure this at all .,science
again our goal is to provide the user the ability to control the computer a a i can and hopefully better .,science
and that mean that they can do it at the same speed a what i can do .,science
it mean that they have access to all the same functionality that i have including all those little detail command tab command space all this stuff and youd be able to do it with the brain .,science
and with the same level of reliability a what i can do with my muscle .,science
and thats a high bar .,science
and we intend to measure and quantify every aspect of that to understand how we are progressing towards that goal .,science
there many way to measure bps by this is not the only way but we present the user a grid of target and we compute a score which is dependent on how fast and accurately they can select and then how small are the target .,science
and the more target that are on the screen the smaller they are the more information you present per click .,science
and if you think about it from an information theory point of view you can communicate across different information theoretic channel .,science
and one such channel is a typing interface you could imagine thats built out of a grid a software keyboard on the screen .,science
and bit per second is a measure thats computed by taking the log of the number of target on the screen .,science
you can subtract one if you care to model a keyboard because you have to subtract one for the delete key on the keyboard .,science
but log of the number of target on the screen time the number of correct selection minus incorrect divided by some time window for example sixty second .,science
and thats the standard way to measure a cursor control task in academia .,science
and all credit in the world go to this great professor dr. shnoy of stanford who came up with that task .,science
and he also one of my inspiration for being in the field .,science
all the credit in the world to him for coming up with a standardized metric to facilitate this bragging right that we have now to say that nolan is the best in the world at this task with his bci .,science
it is very important for progress that you have standardized metric that people can compare across different technique and approach .,science
how old doe this do ?,science
yeah big kudos to him and to all the team at stanford .,science
yeah for nolan and for me playing this task there also different mode that you can configure this task .,science
but the simplest purest form is blue target jump on the screen blue mean left click .,science
thats the simplest form of the game .,science
and the prior record here in academic work and at neuralink internally with nhps have all been matched or beaten by nolan with his neuralink device .,science
prior to neuralink the world record for a human user device is somewhere between four.two to four.six bps depending on exactly what paper you read and how you interpret it .,science
nolans current record is eight.five bps .,science
and again the median neuralink performance is ten bps .,science
you can think of it roughly a he eighty five the level of control of a median neuralink using their cursor to select blue target on the screen .,science
and yeah i think there a very interesting journey ahead to get u to that same level of ten bps performance .,science
it is not the case that the trick that got u from four to six bps and then six to eight bps are going to be the one that get u from eight to ten .,science
and in my view the core challenge here is the labeling problem .,science
it is how do you understand at a very very fine resolution what the user is attempting to do .,science
and yeah i highly encourage folk in academia to work on this problem .,science
whats the journey with nolan on that quest of increasing the bps on webgrid ?,science
in march you said that he selected eighty ninetwo hundred and eighty five target on webgrid .,science
he love this game .,science
he serious about improving his performance in this game .,science
what is that journey of trying to figure out how to improve that performance ?,science
how much can that be done on the decoding side ?,science
how much can that be done on the calibration side ?,science
how much can that be done on the nolan side of figuring out how to convey his intention more cleanly ?,science
yeah no this is a great question .,science
in my view one of the primary reason why nolans performance is good is because of nolan .,science
nolan is extremely focused and very energetic .,science
hell play webgrid sometimes for four hour in the middle of the night from 2am to 6am hell be playing webgrid because he want to push it to the limit of what he can do .,science
and this is not u asking him to do that .,science
i want to be clear .,science
we are not saying hey you should play webgrid tonight .,science
we gave him the game a part of our research and he is able to play independently and practice whenever he want and he push hard to push it the technology to the absolute limit .,science
and he view it a his job to make u be the bottleneck .,science
and boy ha he done that .,science
and the first thing to acknowledge is that he is extremely motivated to make this work .,science
ive also had the privilege to meet other clinical trial participant from braingate and other trial and they very much share the same attitude of they view this a their life work to advance the technology a much a they can .,science
and if that mean selecting target on the screen for four hour from 2am to 6am then be it .,science
and there something extremely admirable about that thats worth calling out .,science
now how do you get from where he started which is no cursor control to 8bps ?,science
when he started there a huge amount of learning to do on his side and our side to figure out whats the most intuitive control for him .,science
and the most intuitive control for him is you have to find the set intersection of what do we have the signal to decode .,science
we do not pick up every single neuron in the motor cortex which mean we do not have representation for every part of the body .,science
there may be some signal that we have better decode performance on than others .,science
for example on his left hand we have a lot of difficulty distinguishing his left ring finger from his left middle finger .,science
but on his hand we have a good good control and good modulation detected from the neuron are able to record for his pinkie and his thumb and his index finger .,science
you can imagine how these different subspace of modulated activity intersect with whats the most intuitive for him .,science
and this ha evolved over time .,science
once we gave him the ability to calibrate model on his own he wa able to go and explore various different way to imagine and control on the cursor .,science
for example he could imagine control on the cursor by wiggling his wrist side to side or by moving his entire arm by i think he had one point into his foot .,science
he tried a whole bunch of stuff to explore the space of what is the most natural way for him to control the cursor that at the same time is easy for u to decode .,science
to clarify it is through the body mapping procedure there you are able to figure out which finger he can move .,science
thats one way to do it .,science
maybe one nuance of the when he doing it he can imagine many more thing that we represent in that visual on the screen .,science
we show him abstractly here a cursor you figure out what work the best for you .,science
and we obviously have hint about what will work best from that body mapping procedure of we know that this particular action we can represent but it is up to him to go and explore and figure out what work the best .,science
but at which point doe he no longer visualize the movement of his body and is visualizing the movement of the cursor ?,science
how quickly doe he go from how quickly doe he get there ?,science
this happened on a tuesday .,science
i remember this day very clearly because at some point during the day it looked he wasnt doing super it looked the model wasnt performing super and he wa getting distracted but he it wasnt the case .,science
what happened wa he wa trying something new where he wa controlling the cursor .,science
he wasnt imagining moving his hand anymore .,science
he wa imagining i do not know what it is some abstract intention to move the cursor on the screen .,science
and i can not tell you what the difference between those two thing are .,science
i truly can not .,science
he tried to explain it to me before .,science
i can not give a first person account of what thats but the expletive that he uttered in that moment were enough to suggest that it wa a very qualitatively different experience for him to have direct neural control over a cursor .,science
i wonder if there a way through ux to encourage a human being to discover that because he discovered it you said to me that he a pioneer .,science
he discovered that on his own through all of this the process of trying to try to move the cursor with different kind of intention .,science
but that is clearly a powerful thing to arrive at which is to let go of trying to control the finger and the hand and control the actual digital device with your mind .,science
ux is how it work .,science
and the ideal ux is one that the user doesnt have to think about what they need to do in order to get it done .,science
that is fascinating .,science
but i wonder on the biological side how long it take for the brain to adapt .,science
is it simply learning high level software ?,science
or is there a neuroplasticity component where the brain is adjusting slowly ?,science
yeah the truth is i do not know .,science
i am very excited to see with the second participant that we implement what the journey is for them because well have learned a lot more .,science
potentially we can help them understand and explore that direction more quickly .,science
this wasnt me prompting nolan to go try this .,science
he wa exploring how to use his device and figure it out himself .,science
but now that we know that thats a possibility that maybe there a way to for example hint the user do not try super hard during calibration .,science
do something that feel natural or directly control the cursor .,science
and from there we should be able to hopefully understand how this is for somebody who ha not experienced that before .,science
maybe thats the default mode of operation for them .,science
you do not have to go through this intermediate phase of explicit motion .,science
or maybe if that naturally happens for people you can occasionally encourage them to allow themselves to move the cursor .,science
sometimes with a fourminute mile the knowledge that thats possible push you to do it .,science
yeah enables you to do it and then it becomes trivial .,science
and then it also make you wonder this is the cool thing about human .,science
once there a lot more human participant they will discover thing that are possible and share their experience .,science
yeah and share it .,science
and then because of them sharing it theyll be able to do it .,science
all of a sudden thats unlocked for everybody .,science
because the knowledge sometimes is the thing that enables it to do it .,science
yeah coming on that too weve probably tried a thousand different way to do various aspect of decoding .,science
and now we know what the subspace is to continue exploring further .,science
again thanks to nolan and the many hour he put into this .,science
and even that help constraint or the beam search of different approach that we could explore help .,science
how do i say for the next person the set of thing that well get to try on day one how fast we hope to get them to useful control how fast we can enable them to use it independently and to give value out of the system .,science
yeah massive hat off to nolan and all the participant that came before him to make this technology a reality .,science
how often are the update to the decoder ?,science
because nolan mentioned there a new update that we are working on and that in the stream he said he play the snake game because it is super hard .,science
it is a good way for him to test how good the update is .,science
and he say sometimes the update is a step backwards .,science
it is a constant iteration .,science
how often what doe the update entail ?,science
is it mostly on the decoder side ?,science
yeah a couple comment .,science
one is probably worth trying distinction between research session where we are actively trying different thing to understand what the best approach is versus independent use where we want to have ability to go use the device how anybody would want to use their macbook .,science
and in those scenario we try in any given session hell sometimes work for eight hour a day .,science
and that can be hundred of different model that we would try in that day a lot of different thing .,science
now it is also worth noting that we update the application he us quite frequently .,science
i think sometimes up to four or five time a day well update his application with different feature or bug fix or feedback that he given u . he been able to he a very articulate person who is part of the solution .,science
he not a complaining person .,science
he say hey here this thing that ive ive discovered is is not optimal in my flow .,science
here some idea how to fix it .,science
let me know what your thought are .,science
let figure out how to how to solve it .,science
and it often happens that those thing are addressed within a couple hour of him giving u his feedback that thats a iteration cycle well have .,science
and sometimes at the beginning of the session hell give u feedback .,science
and at the end of the session he he giving u feedback on the next iteration of that of that of that process or that setup .,science
thats fascinating .,science
because one of the thing you mentioned that there wa two hundred and seventy one page of note taken from the bci session and this wa in march .,science
one of the amazing thing about human being that they can provide especially one who are smart and excited and all positive and good vibe nolan that they can provide feedback continuous feedback .,science
it also requires to brag on the team a little bit .,science
i work with a lot of exceptional people and it requires the team being absolutely laser focused on the user and what will be the best for them .,science
and it requires a level of commitment of this is what the user feedback wa .,science
i have all these meeting we are going to skip that today and we are going to do this .,science
that level of focus commitment is i would say under underappreciated in the world .,science
and also you obviously have to have the talent to be able to execute on these thing effectively .,science
and yeah we have that in load .,science
and this is such a interesting space of ux design because you have there many unknown here .,science
and i can tell ux is difficult because of how many people do it poorly .,science
it is not a trivial thing .,science
it is also ux is not something that you can always solve by constant iterating on different thing .,science
sometimes you need to step back and think globally am i even the minimum to be chasing down for a solution ?,science
there a lot of problem in which fast iteration cycle is the predictor of how successful you will be .,science
a a good example in a in an rl simulation for example the more frequently you get a reward the faster you can progress .,science
it is an easier learning problem the more frequently you get feedback .,science
but ux is not that way .,science
user are quite often wrong about what the solution is .,science
and it requires a deep understanding of the technical system and whats possible combined with what the problem is you are trying to solve not how the user express it but what the true underlying problem is to get to the place .,science
yeah thats the old story of steve job rolling in there yeah the user is a good is a useful signal but it is not a perfect signal .,science
and sometimes you have to remove the floppy disk drive or whatever the i think that all the crazy story of steve job making wild design decision .,science
but there some some of this aesthetic that some of it is about the love you put into the design which is very much a steve job johnny ive type thing .,science
but when you have a human being using their brain to interact with it there is also is deeply about function .,science
it is not aesthetic .,science
and that you have to empathize with the human being before you while not always listening to them directly .,science
they get to deeply empathize .,science
it is fascinating .,science
it is fascinating .,science
and at the same time iterate but not iterate in a small way sometimes a complete rebuilding the design .,science
he said that nolan said in the early day the ux sucked but you improved quickly .,science
what wa that journey ?,science
yeah ill give one concrete example .,science
he wanted to be able to read manga .,science
this is something that he it sound a simple thing but it is a big deal for him .,science
and he couldnt do it with this mouse stick .,science
it wasnt accessible .,science
you can not scroll with the mouse stick on his ipad and on the website that he wanted to be able to use to read the newest manga .,science
and it might be a good quick pause to say the mouse stick is the thing he using holding a stick in his mouth to scroll on a tablet. . yeah .,science
it is you can imagine it is a stylus that you hold between your teeth .,science
it is a very long stylus .,science
and it is exhausting .,science
it hurt and it is inefficient .,science
and maybe it is also worth calling out .,science
there are other alternative resistive technology but that particular situation nolans in and this is not uncommon and i think it is also not understood by folk is that he relatively spastic hell have muscle spasm from time to time .,science
these kind of consideration are important when thinking about what advantage a pci ha in someone life .,science
one of these very fun example is scroll .,science
again manga is something he wanted to be able to read .,science
and there many way to do scroll with a bci .,science
you can imagine different gesture for example the user could do that would move the page .,science
but scroll is a very fascinating control surface because it is a huge thing on the screen in front of you .,science
any jitter in the model output any error in the model output cause an earthquake on the screen .,science
you do not want to have your manga page that you are trying to read be shifted up and down a few pixel because your scroll decoder is not completely accurate .,science
and what we ended up building is this brilliant feature .,science
this is a teammate named bruce who worked on this brilliant work called quick scroll .,science
and quick scroll look at the screen and it identifies where on the screen are scroll bar .,science
and it doe this by deeply integrating with mac o to understand where are the scroll bar actively present on the screen using the accessibility tree thats available to mac o apps .,science
and we identified where those scroll bar are and provided a bci scroll bar .,science
and the bci scroll bar look similar to a normal scroll bar but it behaves very differently in that once you move over to it your cursor morphs onto it it attache or latch onto it .,science
and then once you push up or down in the same way that you would use a push to control the normal cursor it move the screen for you .,science
it is remapping the velocity to a scroll action .,science
and the reason that feel natural and intuitive is that when you move over to attach to it it feel magnetic .,science
you stuck onto it .,science
and then it is one continuous action you do not have to switch your imagined movement you snap onto it and then you get to go .,science
you immediately can start pulling the page down or pushing it up .,science
and even once you get that there many little nuance of how the scroll behavior work to make it natural and intuitive .,science
one example is momentum .,science
when you scroll a page with your finger on the screen you have some flow it doesnt stop when you lift your finger up .,science
the same is true with bci scroll .,science
we had to spend some time to figure out what are the nuance when you do not feel the screen under your fingertip anymore ?,science
what is the dynamic or whats the amount of page give if you will when you push it to make it flow the amount for the user to have a natural experience reading their book .,science
and there a million there i could tell you there many little minutia of how exactly that scroll work that we spent probably a month getting to make that feel extremely natural and easy for the user to navigate .,science
even the scroll on a smartphone with your finger feel extremely natural and pleasant .,science
and it probably take an extremely long time to get that .,science
and the same visionary ux design that we are talking about do not always listen to the user but also listen to them and also have visionary big throw everything out think from first principle but also not .,science
because the current scroll bar experience and the desktop is horrible .,science
it is hard to find hard to control .,science
there not a momentum .,science
and the intention should be clear when i start moving towards the scroll bar there should be a snapping to the scroll bar action .,science
but of course maybe i am paying that cost but there hundred of million of people paying that cost nonstop .,science
but anyway but in this case this is necessary because there an extra cost paid by nolan for the jitteriness .,science
you have to switch between the scrolling and the reading .,science
there ha to be a phase shift between the two when you are scrolling you are scrolling .,science
that is one drawback of the current current approach .,science
maybe one other case study here .,science
again ux is how it work .,science
and we think about that holistically from the even the future detection level of what we detect in the brain to how we design the decoder what we choose to decode to then how it work once it is being used by the user .,science
another good example in that how it work once they are using the decoder the output thats displayed on the screen is not what the decoder say it is also a function of whats going on on the screen .,science
similar to how when you are typing on your phone if you are used to the io keyboard for example it adapts the target size of individual key based on an underlying language model .,science
itll understand if i am typing hey i am going to see l itll make the ekey bigger because in those lock that the person i am going to go see .,science
and that predictiveness can make the experience much more smooth even without improvement to the underlying decoder or or feature detection part of the stack .,science
we do that with a feature called magnetic target we index the screen and we understand these are the place that are very small target it might be difficult to hit .,science
here the cursor dynamic around that location that might be indicative of the user trying to select it .,science
let blow up the size of it in a way that make it easier for the user to snap onto that target .,science
all these little detail they matter a lot in helping the user be independent in their daytoday living .,science
how much of the work on the decoder is generalizable to p2 p3 p4 p5 pn ?,science
how do you improve the decoder in a way thats generalizable ?,science
yeah great question .,science
the underlying signal we are trying to decode is going to look very different in p2 than in p1 .,science
but the approach is the method the user experience of how do you get the behavioral pattern from the user to associate with that neural signal we hope that will translate over multiple generation of user .,science
and beyond that it is very very possible in fact quite likely that weve overfitted to nolans user experience desire and preference .,science
and what i hope to see is that when we get a second third fourth participant that we find what the wide minimas are that cover all the case that make it more intuitive for everyone .,science
and hopefully there a crosspollination of thing where we did not think about that with this user because they can speak .,science
but with this user who can fundamentally not speak at all this user experience is not optimal .,science
and that will those improvement that we make there should hopefully translate then to even people who can not speak but do not feel comfortable doing because we are in a public setting their doctor office .,science
the actual mechanism of open loop labeling and then closed loop labeling will be the same and hopefully can generalize across the different user a they are doing the calibration step .,science
and the calibration step is pretty cool .,science
that in itself the interesting thing about webgrid which is closed loop it is fun .,science
i love it when there they used to be an idea of human computation which is using action that human would want to do anyway to get a lot of signal from .,science
and webgrid is that a nice video game that also serf a great calibration .,science
it is funny .,science
ive heard this reaction many time .,science
before the first user wa implanted we had an internal perception that the first user would not find this fun .,science
and we thought quite a bit about should we build other game that are more interesting for the user we can get this data and help facilitate research thats for long duration stuff this .,science
turn out that people love this game .,science
i always loved it but i did not know that that wa a shared perception .,science
and in case it is not clear webgrid is there a grid of let say thirty five by thirty five cell and one of them light up blue and you have to move your mouse over that and click on it .,science
and if you miss it and it is red and i put this game for many hour many hour .,science
and whats your record you said ?,science
my i think i have the highest at neuralink now .,science
which is about if you imagine that thirty five by thirty five grid you are hitting about one hundred trial per minute .,science
one hundred correct selection in that one minute window .,science
you are averaging about between five hundred six hundred millisecond per selection .,science
one of the reason that i think i struggle with that game is i am such a keyboard person .,science
everything is done with your keyboard .,science
if i can avoid touching the mouse it is great .,science
how can you explain your high performance ?,science
i have a whole ritual i go through .,science
it is a diet plan associated with this .,science
it is a whole thing .,science
the first thing you have to fast for five day .,science
i have to go up to the mountain .,science
it the fascinating thing is important .,science
this is focus the mind .,science
what i do is i i i do not eat for a little bit beforehand .,science
and then ill eat a ton of peanut butter before i play .,science
and i get this is a real thing .,science
this is a real thing .,science
and then it ha to be late at night .,science
this is in a night out .,science
i think we share but it ha to be midnight 2am time window .,science
and i have a very specific physical position ill sit in which is i used to be i wa homeschooled growing up .,science
and i did most of my work on the floor in my bedroom or whatever .,science
and i have a very specific situation on the floor on the floor that i sit and play .,science
and then you have to make sure there not a lot of weight on your elbow when you are playing that you can move quickly .,science
and then i turned the gain of the cursor .,science
the speed of the cursor way way up .,science
it is small motion that move the cursor .,science
are you moving with your wrist or you you are never moving ?,science
i am moving with my finger .,science
my wrist is almost completely still .,science
those in a small tangent which ive been meaning to go down this rabbit hole of people that set the world record in tetri .,science
those folk they are playing there a there a way to did this ?,science
it seems all the finger are moving .,science
you could you could find a way to do it where it is using a loophole a bug that you can do some incredibly fast stuff .,science
it is it is along that line but not quite .,science
but you do realize therell be a few programmer now listening to this whole fast and eat peanut butter .,science
please please try my record .,science
the reason i did this wa because i wanted the bar to be high .,science
i wanted the the number that we aim for should not be the median performance .,science
it should be it should be able to beat all of u at least that should be the minimum bar .,science
what do you think is possible ?,science
yeah i do not know what the limit .,science
the limit you can calculate in term of screen refresh rate and cursor immediately jumping to the next target .,science
but there i am sure there limit before that with reaction time and visual perception and thing this .,science
i would guess it is in the below forty but above twenty somewhere in there .,science
it is probably that there .,science
i never be thinking about .,science
it also matter how difficult the task is .,science
you could imagine some people might be able to do tenzero target on the screen and maybe they can do better that way .,science
there some task optimization you could do to try to boost your performance a . what do you think it take for nolan to be able to do above eight five to keep increasing that number ?,science
you said every increase in the number might require different yeah different improvement in the system .,science
yeah i think the nature of this work is the first the first answer thats important to say is i do not know .,science
this is edge of the research .,science
again nobody gotten to that number before .,science
whats next is going to be a heuristic a guess from my part .,science
what weve seen historically is that different part of the stack would come by next to different time point .,science
when i first joined erlang three year ago or one of the major problem wa the latency of the bluetooth connection .,science
it wa the radio device wasnt super good .,science
it wa an earlier vision of the implant .,science
and it no matter how good your decoder wa if your thing is updating every thirty millisecond or fifty millisecond it is going to be choppy .,science
and no matter how good you are thats going to be frustrating and lead to challenge .,science
at that point it wa very clear that the main challenge is get the data off the device in a very reliable way such that you can enable the next challenge to be tackled .,science
that wa a problem for a bit .,science
and once you saw that it became a different bottleneck .,science
i think the next bottleneck after that wa software stability and reliability .,science
if you have widely varying inference latency in your system or your app lag out every once in a while it decrease your ability to maintain and get in a state of flow and it disrupts your control experience .,science
and there a variety of different software bug and improvement we made that increased the performance of the system made it much more reliable much more stable and led to a state where we could reliably collect data to build better model with .,science
that wa a bottleneck for a while .,science
it is the software stack itself .,science
if i were to guess now there two major direction you could think about for improving bps further .,science
the first major direction is labeling .,science
labeling is again this fundamental challenge of given a window of time where the user is expressing some behavioral intent what are they trying to do at the granularity of every millisecond ?,science
and that again is a task design problem .,science
it is a machine learning problem .,science
it is a software problem .,science
it touch all those different domain .,science
the second thing you can think about to improve bps further is either completely changing the thing you are decoding or extending the number of thing that you are decoding .,science
this is serving the direction of functionality .,science
for example a left click a click a middle click different action click and drag for example .,science
and that can improve the effective bit rate of your communication prosthesis .,science
if you are trying to allow the user to express themselves through any given communication channel you can measure that with this per second .,science
but what measure at the end of the day is how effective are they at navigating their computer .,science
and from the perspective of the downstream task that you care about functionality and extending functionality is something we are very interested in because that only can improve the number of bps .,science
but it can also improve the downstream independence that the user ha and the skill and efficiency with which they can operate their computer .,science
would the number of thread increasing also potentially help ?,science
short answer is yes .,science
it is a bit nuanced how that curve or how that manifest in the number .,science
a you move further out in number of channel you get a corresponding logarithmic improvement in control quality and offline validation metric .,science
the important nuance here is that each channel corresponds with a specific represented intention in the brain .,science
for example if you have a channel two hundred and fifty four it might correspond with moving to the .,science
channel two hundred and fifty six might mean move to the left .,science
if you want to expand the number of function you want to control you want to have a broader set of channel that cover a broader set of imagined movement .,science
you can think of it mr. potato man if you had a bunch of different imagined movement you could do how would you map those imagined movement to input to a computer ?,science
you could imagine handwriting to output character on the screen .,science
you could imagine typing with your finger and have that output text on the screen .,science
you could imagine different finger modulation for different click .,science
you can imagine wiggling your big nose for opening some menu or wiggling your your big toe to have command tab occur or something this .,science
it is the amount of different action you can take in the world depends on how many channel you have and the information content that they carry .,science
thats more about the number of action .,science
a you increase the number of thread thats more about increasing the number of action you are able to perform .,science
one other nuance there that is worth mentioning .,science
again our goal is to enable a user with process to control the computer a fast a i can .,science
thats bps with all the same functionality i have which is what we talked about but then also a reliably a i can .,science
and that last point is very related to channel count discussion .,science
one core thesis that at least i have is that scaling channel count should improve the reliability system without any work on the decoder itself .,science
can you look around the reliability here ?,science
first of all when a nonstationarity of the signal which aspect are you referring to ?,science
maybe let talk briefly what the actual underlying signal look .,science
again i spoke very briefly at the beginning about how when you imagine moving to the or imagine moving to the left neuron might fire more or le .,science
and their frequency content of that signal at least in the motor cortex is very correlated with the output intention of the behavioral task that the user is doing .,science
you could imagine this is not obvious at rate coding which is the name of that phenomenon is the only way the brain can represent information .,science
you can imagine many different way in which the brain could encode intention .,science
and there evidence in bath for example that there temporal code timing code of exactly when particular neuron fire is the mechanism of information representation .,science
but at least in the motor cortex there substantial evidence that it is rate coding or at least one first order effect is that it is rate coding .,science
then if the brain is representing information by changing the frequency of a neuron firing what matter is the delta between the baseline state of the neuron and what it look when it is modulated .,science
and if what you are trying to measure is how much rice is in the pot you are going to get a different measurement different day because you are measuring with different pot .,science
that baseline rate shifting is the thing that at least from a first order description of the problem is whats causing this downstream bias .,science
there can be other effect not linear effect on top of that but at least at a very first order description of the problem thats what we observe day to day is that the baseline firing rate of any particular neuron or observed on a particular channel is changing .,science
can you adjust to the baseline to make it relative to the baseline nonstop ?,science
yeah this is a great question .,science
with monkey we have found various way to do this .,science
for whatever reason that doesnt work super with nolan .,science
i do not know the full reason why but i can imagine several several explanation .,science
one such explanation could be that the context effect difference between some open loop task and some closed loop task is much more significant with nolan than it is with a monkey .,science
maybe in this open loop task he watching the lex freeman podcast while he doing the task or he whistling and listening to music and talking with his friend and ask his mom whats for dinner while he doing this task .,science
and the exact difference in context between those two state may be much larger and thus lead to a bigger generalization gap between the feature that you are normalizing at open loop time and what you are trying to use at closed loop time .,science
thats interesting .,science
on that point it is incredible to watch nolan be able to do to multitask to do multiple task at the same time to be able to move the mouse cursor effectively while talking and while being nervous because he talking in front of the camera .,science
kicking my as and chest too .,science
and now we are talking trash while doing it .,science
all at the same time .,science
and yes if you are trying to normalize to the baseline that might throw everything off .,science
boy is that interesting .,science
maybe one comment on that too for folk that are not familiar with assisted technology .,science
i think there a common belief that why can not you use an eye tracker or something this for helping somebody move a mouse on the screen ?,science
and it is a fair question and one that i wa not confident before nolan that this wa going to be a profoundly transformative technology for people him .,science
and i am very confident now that it will be but the reason are subtle .,science
it ha to do with ergonomically how it fit into their life .,science
even if you can offer the same level of control a what they would have with an eye tracker or with a mouse stick .,science
but you do not need to have that thing in your face .,science
you do not need to be positioned in a certain way .,science
you do not need your caretaker to be around to set it up for you .,science
you can activate it when you want how you want wherever you want .,science
that level of independence is game changing for people .,science
it mean that they can text a friend at night privately without their mom needing to be in the loom .,science
it mean that they can open up and browse the internet at 2am when nobody around to set their ipad up for them .,science
this is a profoundly game changing thing for folk in that situation .,science
and this is even before we start talking about folk that may not be able to communicate at all or ask for help when they want to .,science
this can be potentially the only link that they have to the outside world .,science
and yeah that one doesnt i think need explanation of why thats impactful .,science
how much machine learning is in the decoder ?,science
how much magic ?,science
how much science ?,science
how much art ?,science
how difficult is it to come up with a decoder that figure out what these sequence of spike mean ?,science
yeah good question .,science
there a couple of different way to answer this .,science
maybe ill zoom out briefly first and then ill go down one of the rabbit hole .,science
and the zoomed out view is that building the decoder is the process of building the data set plus compiling it into the weight .,science
and each of those step is important .,science
the direction i think of further improvement is primarily going to be in the data set side of how do you construct the optimal label for the model .,science
but there an entirely separate challenge of then how do you compile the best model .,science
and ill go briefly down the second one down the second rabbit hole .,science
one of the main challenge with designing the optimal model for bci is that offline metric do not necessarily correspond to online metric .,science
it is fundamentally a control problem .,science
the user is trying to control something on the screen .,science
and the exact user experience of how you output the intention impact their ability to control .,science
for example if you look at validation loss a predicted by your model there can be multiple way to achieve the same validation loss .,science
not all of them are equally controllable by the end user .,science
and it might be a simple a saying you could add auxiliary loss term that help you capture the thing that matter .,science
but this is a very complex nuanced process .,science
how you turn the label into the model is more of a nuanced process than a standard supervised learning problem .,science
one very fascinating anecdote here weve tried many different neural network architecture that translate brain data to velocity output for example .,science
and one example that stuck in my brain from a couple year ago now is at one point we were using fully connected network to decode the brain activity .,science
we tried a ab test where we were measuring the relative performance in online control session of one deconvolution over the input signal .,science
if you imagine per channel you have a sliding window thats producing some convolved feature for each of those input sequence for every single channel simultaneously you can get better validation metric meaning you are fitting the data better .,science
and it is generalizing better and offline data if you use this convolutional architecture .,science
you are reducing parameter it is a standard procedure when you deal with time series data .,science
now it turn out that when using that model online the controllability wa worse wa far worse even though the offline metric were better .,science
and there can be many way to interpret that .,science
there still some artistry left to be uncovered here of how to get your model to scale with more compute .,science
and that may be fundamentally labeling problem but there may be other component to this a . is it data constrained at this time ?,science
which is what it sound ?,science
how do you get a lot of good label ?,science
yeah i think it is data quality constrained not necessarily data quantity constrained .,science
but even even the quantity because it ha to be trained on the interaction .,science
i guess there not that many interaction .,science
yeah it depends what version of this you are talking about .,science
if you are talking about let say the simplest example of 2d velocity then i think yeah data quality is the main thing .,science
if you are talking about how to build a multifunction output that let you do all the input to the computer that you and i can do then it is a much more sophisticated nuanced modeling challenge .,science
one example of an interesting bug from week one of a bci with nolan wa when he moved the mouse the click signal dropped off a cliff and when he stopped the click signal went up .,science
again there a contamination between the two input .,science
another good example wa at one point he wa trying to do a left click and drag .,science
and the minute he started moving the left click signal dropped off a cliff .,science
again because there some contamination between the two signal you need to come up with some way to either in the dataset or in the model build robustness against this you think of it overfitting but it is that model ha not seen this variability before .,science
you need to find some way to help the model with that .,science
this is super cool .,science
because it feel all of this is very solvable but it is hard .,science
yes it is fundamentally an engineering challenge .,science
this is important to emphasize and it is also important to emphasize that it may not need fundamentally new technique which mean that people who work on let say unsupervised speech classification using ctc loss for example with internal tessiri they could potentially have very applicable skill to this .,science
what thing are you excited about in the future development of the software stack on the neuralink ?,science
everything weve been talking about the decoding the ux .,science
i think there something i am excited about from the technology side and some i am excited about for understanding how this technology is going to be best situated for entering the world .,science
ill work backwards .,science
on the technology entering the world side of thing i am excited to understand how this device work for folk that can not speak at all that have no ability to bootstrap themselves into useful control by voice command for example and are extremely limited in their current capability .,science
i think that will be an incredibly useful signal for u to understand what is an existential threat for all startup which is product market fit doe this device have the capacity and potential to transform people life in the current state ?,science
and if not what are the gap ?,science
and if there are gap how do we solve them most efficiently ?,science
thats what i am very excited about for the next year or of clinical trial operation .,science
the technology side i am quite excited about everything we are doing .,science
i think it is going to be awesome .,science
the most prominent one i would say is scaling channel count .,science
now we have a thousand channel device .,science
the next version will have between three and six thousand channel .,science
and i would expect that curve to continue in the future .,science
and it is unclear what set of problem will disappear completely at that scale .,science
and what set of problem will remain and require further focus .,science
and i am excited about the clarity of gradient that that give u in term of the user experience that we choose to focus our time and resource on .,science
and also in term of the yeah even thing a simple a nonstationarity doe that problem completely go away at that scale ?,science
or do we need to come up with new creative uxs still even at that point ?,science
and again you do not have that proper set of feedback .,science
how can you make that intuitive for a user to control a high dimensional control surface without feeling the thing physically ?,science
i think thats going to be a super interesting problem .,science
i am also quite excited to understand do these scaling law continue ?,science
a you scale channel count how much further out do you go before that saturation point is truly hit ?,science
and it is not obvious today .,science
i think we only know whats in the interpolation space .,science
we only know whats between zero and one thousand two hundred and twenty four but we do not know whats beyond that .,science
and then there a whole range of interesting neuroscience and brain question which is when you stick more stuff in the brain in more place you get to learn much more quickly about what those brain region represent .,science
and i am excited about that fundamental neuroscience learning which is also important for figuring out how to most efficiently insert electrode in the future .,science
yeah i think all those dimension i am excited about .,science
and that doesnt even get close to touching the software stack that we work on every single day and what we are working on now .,science
yeah it seems virtually impossible to me that a thousand electrode is where it saturates .,science
it feel this would be one of those silly notion in the future where obviously you should have million of electrode .,science
and this is where the true breakthrough happen .,science
you tweeted some thought are most precisely described in poetry .,science
what do you think that is ?,science
i think it is because the information bottleneck of language is pretty steep .,science
and yet you are you are able to reconstruct on the other person in the other person brain more effectively without being literal .,science
if you if you can express the sentiment such that in their brain they can reconstruct the actual true underlying meaning and beauty of the thing that you are trying to get across the generator functioning their brain is more powerful than what language can express .,science
and the mechanism of poetry is to feed or seed that generator function .,science
being literal sometimes is a suboptimal compression for the thing you are trying to convey .,science
and it is in the process of the user going through that generation that they understand what you mean .,science
thats the beautiful part .,science
it is also when you look at a beautiful painting it is not the pixel of the painting that are beautiful .,science
it is the thought process that occurs when that the experience of that that is i think that matter .,science
yeah it is resonating with some deep thing within you that the artist also experienced and wa able to convey that through the pixel .,science
and thats going to be relevant for full on telepathy .,science
it is if you read the poetry that doesnt say much of anything interesting .,science
it requires a human to interpret it .,science
it is the combination of the human mind and all the experience that human being ha within the context of the collective intelligence of the human specie that make that poem make sense .,science
and they load that in .,science
and in that same way the signal that carry from human to human meaning might not may seem trivial but may carry a lot of power because of the complexity of the human mind and the receiving end .,science
yeah thats interesting .,science
i had poetry still doesnt who wa it ?,science
i think yoshibako first watch always said something about all the people that think weve achieved agi explain why human music .,science
and until the agi like music you havent achieved agi or something that .,science
do you not think thats some next token entropy surprise thing going on there ?,science
i do not know either .,science
i listen to a lot of classical music and also read a lot of poetry .,science
and yeah i do wonder if there is some element of the next token surprise factor going on there .,science
because a lot of the trick in both poetry and music are you have some repeated structure and then you do a twist .,science
it is verse or clause one two three is one thing .,science
and then clause four is now we are on to the next theme .,science
and they play with exactly when the surprise happens and the expectation of the user .,science
and thats even true through history a musician evolve music they take some known structure that people are familiar with and they tweak it a little bit .,science
they tweak it and add a surprising element .,science
this is especially true in in classical music heritage .,science
thats what i am wondering is it all entropy ?,science
breaking structure or breaking symmetry is something that human seem to maybe a simple a that .,science
and great artist copy .,science
and they also knowing which rule to break is the important part .,science
and that it fundamentally it must be about the listener of the piece .,science
which rule is the one to break is about the user or the audience member perceiving that a interesting .,science
what do you think is the meaning of human existence ?,science
there a tv show i called the west wing .,science
and in the west wing there a character is the president of the united state who having a discussion about the bible with one of their colleague .,science
and the colleague say something about the bible say x y and z. and the president say yeah but it also say abc .,science
and the person say do you believe the bible to be true ?,science
and the president say yes but i also think that neither of u are smart enough to understand it .,science
i think to the analogy here for the meaning of life is that largely we do not know the question to ask .,science
and i think i am very aligned with the hitchhiker guide the galaxy version of this question which is if we can ask the question it is much more likely we find the meaning of human existence .,science
and in the short term a a heuristic in the search policy space we should try to increase the diversity of people asking such question or generally of consciousness and conscious being asking such question .,science
again i think ill take the i do not know card here but say i do think there are meaningful thing we can do that improve the likelihood of answering that question .,science
it is interesting how much value you assign to the task of asking the question .,science
thats the main thing is not the answer is the question .,science
and in that situation it is very obvious that what matter is are you asking them the question to be able to say yes or no to .,science
wow thats powerful .,science
bliss thank you for everything you do .,science
and thank you for being you .,science
and thank you for talking today .,science
thank you .,science
thanks for listening to this conversation with bliss chapman .,science
and now dear friend here nolan arbaugh the first human being to have a neural link device implanted in his brain .,science
you had a diving accident in two thousand and sixteen that left you paralyzed with no feeling from the shoulder down .,science
how did that accident change your life ?,science
there a freak thing that happened .,science
imagine you are running into the ocean .,science
although this is a lake but you are running into the ocean and you get to about waist high and then you dive in take the rest of the plunge under the wave or something .,science
thats what i did .,science
and then i never came back up .,science
not sure what happened .,science
i did it running into the water with a couple of guy .,science
and my idea of what happened is that i took a stray fist elbow knee foot something to the side of my head .,science
the left side of my head wa sore for about a month afterward .,science
and then they both came up and i did not .,science
and i wa face down in the water for a while .,science
i wa conscious .,science
and then eventually realized i couldnt hold my breath any longer .,science
people i do not know if they that i say that seems i am making light of it all but this is how i am .,science
and i do not know i am a very relaxed stress free person .,science
i rolled with the punch for a lot of this .,science
it is all what can i do next ?,science
i could somehow survive once i left the hospital .,science
and then thank god i had my family around me .,science
if i did not have my parent my sibling then i would have never made it this far .,science
theyve done much for me more than i can ever thank them for honestly .,science
and a lot of people do not have that .,science
a lot of people in my situation their family either are not capable of providing for them or honestly do not want to .,science
and they get placed somewhere and in some home .,science
thankfully i had my family .,science
i have a great group of friend a great group of buddy from college who have all rallied around me .,science
and we are all still incredibly close .,science
people always say if you are lucky youll end up with one or two friend from high school that you keep throughout your life .,science
i have about ten ten or twelve from high school that have all stuck around .,science
and we still get together all of u twice a year .,science
we call it the spring series and the fall series .,science
this last one we all did we dressed up xmen .,science
yeah i have such a great support system around me .,science
and being a quadriplegic is not that bad .,science
i get waited on all the time .,science
people bring me food and drink .,science
and i get to sit around and watch a much tv and movie and anime a i want .,science
i get to read a much a i want .,science
it is great .,science
it is beautiful to see that the silver lining and all of this .,science
we are going back .,science
do you remember the moment when you first realized you were paralyzed from the neck down ?,science
i wa face down in the water when i whatever something hit my head .,science
i tried to get up and i realized i couldnt move and it clicked .,science
can not move .,science
if i can not get up i can not flip over can not do anything then i am going to drown eventually .,science
and i knew i couldnt hold my breath forever .,science
i held my breath and thought about it for maybe ten fifteen second .,science
ive heard from other people that onlooker i guess the two girl that pulled me out of the water were two of my best friend .,science
they were lifeguard .,science
and one of them said that it looked my body wa shaking in the water .,science
i wa trying to flip over and stuff .,science
but i knew .,science
i knew immediately .,science
and i i realized that thats what my situation wa from here on out .,science
maybe if i got to the hospital theyd be able to do something .,science
when i wa in the hospital before surgery i wa trying to calm one of my friend down .,science
i had brought her with me from college to camp .,science
and she wa bawling over me and i wa hey it is going to be fine .,science
i wa cracking some joke to try to lighten the mood .,science
the nurse had called my mom and i wa do not tell my mom .,science
shes going to be stressed out .,science
call her after i am out of surgery because at least shell have some answer then whether i live or not .,science
and i did not want her to be stressed through the whole thing .,science
but i knew .,science
and then when i first woke up after surgery i wa super drugged up .,science
they had me on fentanyl three way which wa awesome .,science
but i saw i saw some crazy stuff on that fentanyl .,science
and it wa still the best ive ever felt on drug .,science
medication sorry on medication .,science
and i remember the first time i saw my mom in the hospital i wa bawling .,science
i had ventilator in i couldnt talk or anything .,science
and i started cry because it wa more seeing her not that the whole situation obviously wa pretty rough .,science
but i wa seeing her face for the first time wa pretty hard .,science
but yeah i i never had a moment of man i am paralyzed .,science
this suck .,science
i do not want to be around anymore .,science
it wa always i hate that i have to do this but sitting here and wallowing is not going to help .,science
ha there been low point along the way ?,science
there are day when i do not feel doing anything not much anymore not for the last couple of year i do not feel that way .,science
ive more wanted to try to do anything possible to make my life better at this point .,science
but at the beginning there were some ups and down there were some hard thing to adjust to .,science
first off the first couple month the amount of pain i wa in wa hard .,science
i remember screaming at the top of my lung in the hospital because i thought my leg were on fire .,science
and obviously i can not feel anything but it is all nerve pain .,science
and that wa a hard night .,science
i asked them to give me a much pain med a possible that youve had a much a you can have .,science
deal with it go to a happy place thing .,science
that wa a pretty low point .,science
and then every now and again it is hard realizing thing that i wanted to do in my life that i will not be able to do anymore .,science
i always wanted to be a husband and father and i do not think that i could do it now a a quadriplegic .,science
maybe it is possible but i am not sure i would ever put someone i love through that having to take care of me and stuff .,science
not being able to go out and play sport .,science
i wa a huge athlete growing up .,science
that wa pretty hard .,science
little thing too when i realize i can not do them anymore .,science
there something special about being able to hold a book and smell a book the feel the texture the smell a you turn the page i love it .,science
and it is little thing that .,science
the two year mark wa pretty rough .,science
two year is when they say you will get back a much a you are ever going to get back a far a movement and sensation go .,science
and for the first two year that wa the only thing on my mind wa try a much a i can to move my finger my hand my foot everything possible to try to get sensation and movement back .,science
and then when the two year mark hit june 30th two thousand and eighteen i wa sad that thats where i wa .,science
and then randomly here and there but i wa never depressed for long period of time .,science
it never seemed worthwhile to me .,science
what gave you strength ?,science
my understanding that it wa all for purpose .,science
and even if that purpose wasnt anything involving narrow link even if that purpose wa there a story in the bible about job .,science
and i think it is a popular story about how job ha all of these terrible thing happen to him and he praise god throughout the whole situation .,science
i thought and i think a lot of people think for most of their life that they are job that they are the one going through something terrible and they need to praise god through the whole thing and everything will work out .,science
at some point after my accident i realized that i might not be job that i might be one of his child that get killed or kidnapped or taken from him .,science
and it is about terrible thing that happen to those around you who you love .,science
maybe in this case my mom would be job and she ha to get through something extraordinarily hard .,science
and i need to try and make it a best a possible for her because shes the one thats going through this massive trial .,science
and that gave me a lot of strength .,science
and obviously my family my family and my friend they give me all the strength that i need on a daytoday basis .,science
it make thing a lot easier having that great support system around me .,science
from everything ive seen of you online your stream and the way you are today i admire let say your unwavering positive outlook on life .,science
ha that always been this way ?,science
ive always thought i could do anything i ever wanted to do .,science
there wa never anything too big .,science
whatever i set my mind to i felt i could do it .,science
i did not want to do a lot .,science
i wanted to travel around and be a gypsy and go work odd job .,science
i had this dream of traveling around europe and being i do not know a shepherd in wale or ireland and then going and being a fisherman in italy doing all these thing for a year .,science
it is such cliche thing but i thought it would be much fun to go and travel and do different thing .,science
and ive always seen the best in people around me too .,science
and ive always tried to be good to people .,science
and growing up with my mom too shes the most positive energetic person in the world .,science
and we are all people .,science
i get along great with people .,science
and i wanted to do everything .,science
this is how ive been .,science
it is great to see that cynicism did not take over given everything youve been through .,science
wa that a deliberate choice you made that you are not going to let this keep you down ?,science
i i said i roll with the punch with everything .,science
i always used to tell people i do not stress about thing much .,science
and whenever id see people getting stressed or say it is not hard do not stress about it .,science
and thats all you need to do .,science
and they are thats not how that work .,science
it work for me .,science
i do not stress and everything will be fine .,science
everything will work out .,science
obviously not everything always go .,science
and it is not it all work out for the best all the time .,science
but i do not think stress ha had any place in my life since i wa a kid .,science
what wa the experience of you being selected to be the first human being to have on your link device implanted in your brain ?,science
were you scared ?,science
i wa i wa never afraid of it .,science
i had to think through a lot .,science
should i should i do this ?,science
be the first person i could wait until number two or three and get a better version of the narrow link the first one might not work .,science
maybe it is going to suck .,science
it is going to be the worst version ever in a person .,science
why would i do the first one ?,science
ive already been selected i could tell them find someone else and then ill do number two or three .,science
i am sure they would let me .,science
they are looking for a few people anyways .,science
but ultimately i wa i do not know there something about being the first one to do something .,science
it is pretty cool .,science
i always thought that if i had the chance that i would to do something for the first time this seemed a pretty good opportunity .,science
and i wa i wa never scared .,science
i think my faith had a huge part in that .,science
i always felt god wa preparing me for something .,science
i almost wish it wasnt this because i had many conversation with god about not wanting to do any of this a a quadriplegic .,science
i told them ill go out and talk to people ill go out and travel the world and talk to stadium thousand of people give my testimony ill do all of it but heal me first .,science
do not make me do all this in a chair .,science
that suck .,science
and i guess he won that argument .,science
i did not have much of a choice .,science
i always felt there wa something going on .,science
and to see how i guess easily i made it through the interview process and how quickly everything happened how the star aligned with all this .,science
it told me a the surgery wa getting closer it told me that it wa all meant to happen .,science
it wa all meant to be .,science
and i shouldnt be afraid of anything thats to come .,science
and i wasnt i kept telling myself you say that now but a soon a the surgery come you are probably going to be freaking out .,science
you are about to have brain surgery .,science
and brain surgery is a big deal for a lot of people but it is an even bigger deal for me .,science
it is all i have left the amount of time ive been thank you god that you did not take my brain and my personality and my ability to think my love of learning my character everything thank you much .,science
a long a you left me that then i think i can get by .,science
and i wa about to let people go root around in there hey we are going to go put some stuff in your brain hopefully it work out .,science
and it wa it wa something that gave me pause .,science
but i said how smoothly everything went i never expected for a second that anything would go wrong .,science
plus the more people i met on the borough side and on the knurling side they are the most impressive people in the world .,science
i can not speak enough to how much i trust these people with my life and how impressed i am with all of them .,science
and to see the excitement on their face to walk into a room and roll into a room and see all of these people looking at me we are we are excited weve been working hard on this and it is finally happening .,science
it is super infectious .,science
and it make me want to do it even more and to help them achieve their dream .,science
i do not know it is it is rewarding .,science
and i am happy for all of them honestly .,science
what wa the day of surgery ?,science
whats when did you wake up ?,science
yeah minute by minute .,science
yeah were you freaking out ?,science
no i thought i wa going to but a surgery approach the night before the morning of i wa excited .,science
i wa let make this happen .,science
i think i said that something that to elon on the phone .,science
before hand we were facetiming .,science
and i wa let rock and roll .,science
and he let do it .,science
i i wasnt scared .,science
we woke up i think we had to be at the hospital five hundred and thirty am i think surgery wa at seven am .,science
we woke up pretty early .,science
i am not sure much of u slept that night .,science
got to the hospital five hundred and thirty went through all the preop stuff .,science
everyone wa super nice .,science
elon wa supposed to be there in the morning but something went wrong with his plane .,science
we ended up facetiming .,science
that wa cool .,science
had one of the greatest oneliners of my life after that phone call .,science
hung up with him .,science
there were twenty people around me .,science
and i wa i hope he wasnt too starstruck talking to me .,science
did you write that ahead of time ?,science
i wa this seems .,science
went into surgery .,science
i prayed over the room .,science
i asked god if you would be with my mom in case anything happened to me .,science
and calm her nerve out there .,science
woke up and played a bit of a prank on my mom .,science
i do not know if youve heard about it .,science
yeah i read about it .,science
she wa not happy .,science
can you take me to the prank ?,science
this is something you regret doing that now ?,science
it wa something i had talked about ahead of time with my buddy bane .,science
i wa i would to play a prank on my mom .,science
very specifically my mom .,science
shes very gullible .,science
i think she had knee surgery once even .,science
and after she came out of knee surgery she wa super groggy .,science
she wa i can not feel my leg .,science
and my dad looked at her he wa you do not have any leg .,science
they had to amputate both your leg .,science
and we do very mean thing to her all the time .,science
i am surprised that she still love u . but after surgery i wa worried that i wa going to be too groggy not all there .,science
i had had anesthesia once before and it messed me up .,science
i could not function for a while afterwards .,science
i said a lot of thing that i wa worried that i wa going to start i do not know dropping some bomb and i wouldnt even know .,science
i wa please god do not let that happen .,science
and please let me be there enough to do this to my mom .,science
and she walked in after surgery .,science
it wa the first time they had been able to see me after surgery .,science
and she looked at me .,science
how are you doing ?,science
and i looked at her and this very i think the anesthesia helped very groggy confused look on my face .,science
it is who are you ?,science
and she started looking around the room at the surgeon at the doctor .,science
what did you do to my son ?,science
you need to fix this now .,science
tear started streaming .,science
i saw how much she wa freaking out .,science
i wa i can not let this go on .,science
and i wa mom i am fine .,science
it is all .,science
and still she wa not happy about it .,science
she still say shes going to get me back someday .,science
but i do not know .,science
i do not know what thats going to look .,science
it is a lifelong battle .,science
but it wa good .,science
in some sense it wa a demonstration that you still got .,science
thats all i wanted it to be .,science
and i knew that doing something super mean to her that would show her .,science
to show that you are still there that you love her .,science
yeah exactly .,science
it is a dark way to do it but i love it .,science
what wa the first time you were able to feel that you can use the neuralink device to affect the world around you ?,science
yeah the first little taste i got of it wa not too long after surgery .,science
some of the neuralink team had brought in a little ipad a little tablet screen and they put up eight different channel that were recording some of my neuron spike .,science
and they put it in front of me .,science
they are this is real time your brain firing .,science
thats super cool .,science
my first thought wa if they are firing now let see if i can affect them in some way .,science
i started trying to wiggle my finger .,science
and i started scanning through the channel .,science
and one of the thing i wa doing wa moving my index finger up and down .,science
and i saw this yellow spike on top row third box over or something .,science
i saw this yellow spike every time i did it .,science
and i wa thats cool .,science
and everyone around me wa what are you seeing ?,science
i wa look at this one .,science
look at this top row third box over this yellow spike .,science
thats me there there there .,science
and everyone wa freaking out .,science
they started clapping .,science
i wa thats super unnecessary .,science
this is whats supposed to happen ?,science
you are imagining yourself moving each individual finger one at a time .,science
and then seeing you can notice something .,science
and then when you did the index finger you are yeah i wa i wa wiggling all of my finger to see if anything would happen .,science
there wa a lot of other thing going on but that big yellow spike wa the one that stood out to me .,science
i am sure that if i would have stared at it long enough i could have mapped out maybe one hundred different thing .,science
but the big yellow spike wa the one that i noticed .,science
maybe you could speak to what it is to wiggle your finger to to imagine that the mental the cognitive effort required to wiggle your index finger for example .,science
how easy is that to do ?,science
pretty easy for me .,science
thats fascinating .,science
yeah i know .,science
it is bizarre but thats part of the recovery process is to keep trying to move your body .,science
and thats a much a you can .,science
and the nervous system doe it thing .,science
it start reconnecting .,science
itll start reconnecting for some people .,science
some people theyll do it .,science
for me i got some bicep control back .,science
and thats about it .,science
i can if i try enough i can wiggle some of my finger not on command .,science
it is more if i try to move say my pinky and i keep trying to move it after a few second itll wiggle .,science
i know there stuff there .,science
i know that happens with a few different of my finger and stuff .,science
but yeah thats what they tell you to do .,science
one of the people at the time when i wa in the hospital came in and told me for one guy who had recovered most of his control what he thought about every day wa walking the act of walking over and over again .,science
i tried that for year .,science
i tried imagining walking which is it is hard .,science
it is hard to imagine all of the step that go into taking a step all of the thing that have to move all the activation that have to happen along your leg in order for one step to occur .,science
it is it is imagining over again what i had to do to take a step because it is not something any of u think about .,science
you do not think about all of the different thing that are going on in your body .,science
i had to recreate that in my head a much a i could .,science
and then i practice it over and over and over .,science
it is not a third person perspective is the first person perspective .,science
you are it is not you are imagining yourself walking .,science
you are doing this everything all the same stuff a if you are walking .,science
which wa hard .,science
it wa hard at the beginning .,science
frustrating hard or cognitively hard ?,science
which way ?,science
it wa both .,science
there a scene in one of the kill bill movie oddly enough where she is paralyzed .,science
i do not know from a drug that wa in her system .,science
and then she find some way to get into the back of a truck or something .,science
and she stare at her toe and she say move move your big toe .,science
and after a few second on screen she doe it .,science
and she did that with every one of her body part until she can move again .,science
i did that for year stared at my body and said move your index finger move your big toe .,science
sometimes vocalizing it out loud but sometimes thinking it i tried every different way to do this to try to get some movement back .,science
and it feel those signal get stuck in whatever body part that i am trying to move .,science
and they build up and build up and build up until they burst .,science
and then once they burst i get this weird sensation of everything dissipating back out to level .,science
and then i do it again .,science
it is also a fatigue thing a muscle fatigue but without moving your muscle .,science
it is very very bizarre .,science
and then if you try to stare at a body part or think about a body part and move for two three four sometimes eight hour it is very taxing on your mind .,science
it is take a lot of focus .,science
it wa a lot easier at the beginning because i wasnt able to control a tv in my room or anything .,science
i wasnt able to control any of my environment .,science
for the first few year a lot of what i wa doing wa staring at wall .,science
and obviously i did a lot of thinking and i tried to move a lot over and over and over again .,science
do you never give up hope there ?,science
training hard essentially ?,science
i do it subconsciously .,science
and i think that that helped a lot with thing with neuralink honestly something that i talked about the other day at the all hand that i did at neuralinks austin facility .,science
welcome to austin by the way .,science
hey thanks man .,science
nice hat .,science
hey thanks .,science
thanks man .,science
the gigafactory wa super cool .,science
i went to school at texas am ive been around for ... you should be saying welcome to me .,science
welcome to texas like .,science
but yeah i wa talking about how a lot of what theyve had me do especially at the beginning i still do it now is body mapping .,science
there will be a visualization of a hand or an arm on the screen and i have to do that motion and thats how they train the algorithm to understand what i am trying to do .,science
and it made thing very seamless for me i think .,science
thats cool .,science
it is amazing to know because ive learned a lot about the body mapping procedure with the interface and everything that .,science
it is cool to know that youve been essentially training to be worldclass at that task .,science
i do not know if other quadriplegic other paralyzed people give up .,science
i hope they do not .,science
i hope they keep drawing because ive heard other paralyzed people say do not ever stop .,science
they tell you two year but you never know .,science
the human body is capable of amazing thing .,science
ive heard other people say do not give up .,science
i think one girl had spoken to me through some family member and said that she had been paralyzed for eighteen year and shed been trying to wiggle her index finger for all that time and she finally got a bat eighteen year later .,science
i know that it is possible and ill never give up doing it .,science
i do it when i am lying down watching tv .,science
ill find myself doing it almost on it own .,science
it is something ive gotten used to doing that i do not think ill ever stop .,science
thats awesome to hear because i think it is one of those thing that can pay off in the long term because it is training .,science
you are not visibly seen the result of that training at the moment but there an olympic level nervous system getting ready for something .,science
which honestly wa something that i think nerling gave me that i can not think them enough for .,science
i can not show my appreciation for it enough .,science
wa being able to visually see that what i am doing is having some effect .,science
it is a huge part of the reason why i know now that i am going to keep doing it forever .,science
because before nerling i wa doing it every day and i wa assuming that thing were happening .,science
it is not i knew .,science
i wasnt getting back any mobility or sensation or anything .,science
i could have been running up against a brick wall for all i knew .,science
and with nerling i get to see all the signal happening real time .,science
and i get to see that what i am doing can be mapped when we started doing click calibration and stuff .,science
when i go to click my index finger for a left click that it recognizes that .,science
it changed how i think about whats possible with retraining my body to move .,science
and also the signal that there still a powerhouse of a brain there thats and a the technology develops that brain is thats the most important thing about the human body is the brain .,science
and it can do a lot of the control .,science
what did it feel when you first could wiggle the index finger and saw the environment respond ?,science
that little wherever we are being way too dramatic according to you .,science
yeah it wa very cool .,science
it wa cool but i keep telling this to people .,science
it made sense that there are signal still happening in my brain .,science
and that a long a you had something near it that could measure those that could record those then you should be able to visualize it in some way see it happen .,science
and that wa not very surprising to me .,science
we found one .,science
we found something that work .,science
it wa cool to see that their technology worked and that everything that theyd worked hard for wa going to pay off .,science
but i moved a cursor or anything at that point i had interacted with a computer or anything at that point .,science
it wa cool .,science
i did not know much about bci at that point either .,science
i did not know what step this wa making .,science
i did not know if this wa a huge deal or if this wa this is it is cool that we got this far but we are hoping for something much better down the road .,science
it is i thought that they knew that it turned on .,science
it wa cool .,science
this is cool .,science
did you read up on the spec of the hardware you get installed the number of thread ?,science
yeah i knew all of that .,science
but it is all greek to me .,science
i wa thread sixty four thread sixteen electrode one thousand and twenty four channel .,science
that that math check out .,science
what wa the first time you were able to move a mouse cursor ?,science
i know it must have been within the first maybe week a week or two week that i wa able to first move the cursor .,science
and again it made sense to me .,science
it did not seem that big of a deal .,science
it wa how do i explain this ?,science
when everyone around you start clapping for something that youve done it is easy to say i did something cool .,science
that wa impressive in some way .,science
what exactly that meant what it wa hadnt set in for me .,science
again i knew that me trying to move a body part and then that being mapped in some machine learning algorithm to be able to identify my brain signal and then take that and give me cursor control .,science
that all made sense to me .,science
i do not know all the in and out of it .,science
but i wa there are still signal in my brain firing .,science
they can not get through because there a gap in my spinal cord .,science
and they they can not get all the way down and back up but they are still there .,science
when i moved the cursor for the first time i wa thats cool but i expected that that should happen .,science
when i moved the cursor for the first time with my mind without physically trying to move .,science
i guess i can get into that a little bit the difference between attempt and movement and imagine movement .,science
yeah thats a fascinating difference .,science
big for one to the other .,science
attempted movement is me physically trying to attempt to move say my hand .,science
i try to attempt to move my hand to the to the left forward and back .,science
and thats all attempted attempt to lift my finger up and down attempt to kick or something .,science
i am physically trying to do all of those thing even if you can not see it .,science
i am this would be me attempting to shrug my shoulder or something .,science
thats all attempted movement .,science
that all thats what i wa doing for the first couple of week when they were going to give me cursor control .,science
when i wa doing body mapping it wa attempt to do this attempt to do that .,science
when nir wa telling me to imagine doing it it made sense to me but it is not something that people practice .,science
if you started school a a child and they said write your name with this pencil .,science
and you do that .,science
now imagine writing your name with that pencil .,science
kid would think i guess that make sense .,science
and they would do it .,science
but thats not something we are taught .,science
it is all how to do thing physically .,science
we think about thought experiment and thing but thats not thats not a physical action of doing thing .,science
it is more what you would do in certain situation .,science
imagine movement it never connected with me .,science
i guess you could maybe describe it a a professional athlete swinging a baseball bat or swinging a golf club imagine what you are supposed to do .,science
but then you go to that and physically do it .,science
you then you get a bat in your hand and then you do what youve been imagining .,science
and i do not have that connection .,science
telling me to imagine something versus attempting it it there wasnt a lot that i could do there mentally .,science
i had to accept what wa going on and try .,science
but the attempt to move and thing it all made sense to me .,science
if i try to move then there a signal being sent in my brain .,science
and a long a they can pick that up then they should be able to map it to what i am trying to do .,science
and when i first moved the cursor that it wa it wa yes this should happen .,science
i am not surprised by that .,science
but can you clarify is there supposed to be a difference between imagine movement and attempted movement ?,science
yeah that in imagine movement you are not attempting to move at all .,science
it is you are visualizing and then theoretically is that supposed to be a different part of the brain that light up in those two different situation ?,science
yeah not necessarily .,science
i think all these signal can still be represented in motor cortex .,science
but the difference i think ha to do with the naturalness of imagining something inverse attempting it and the fatigue of that over time .,science
and by the way on the mic is bliss .,science
this is different way to prompt you to get to the thing that you are around at .,science
attempted movement doe sound the thing .,science
because imagine for me i would start visualizing .,science
in my mind visualizing attempted i would start trying to there a i i did combat sport my whole life wrestling when i am imagining a move see i am moving my muscle .,science
there a there is a bit of an activation almost versus visualizing yourself a picture doing it .,science
yeah it is something that i feel naturally anyone would do .,science
if you try to tell someone to imagine doing something they might close their eye and then start physically doing it .,science
but it is it did not click .,science
it is it is hard .,science
it wa very hard at the beginning .,science
but attempted worked .,science
attempted worked .,science
it worked it should work work a charm .,science
remember there wa one tuesday we were messing around and i think i forget what swear word you used but there a swear word that came out of your mouth when you figured out you could do the direct cursor control .,science
thats it .,science
it blew my mind no pun intended .,science
blew my mind when i first moved the cursor with my thought and not attempting to move .,science
it is something that i found over the couple of week building up to that that a i get better cursor control the model get better then it get easier for me to i do not have to attempt a much to move it .,science
and part of that is something that id even talked with them about when i wa watching the signal of my brain one day .,science
i wa watching when i attempted to move to the and i watched the screen a i saw the spike .,science
i wa seeing the spike the signal being sent before i wa attempting to move .,science
i imagine because when you go to say move your hand or any body part that signal get sent before you are moving ha to make it all the way down and back up before you do any movement .,science
there a delay there .,science
and i noticed that there wa something going on in my brain before i wa attempting to move that my brain wa anticipating what i wanted to do .,science
and that all started i do not know percolating in my brain .,science
it it wa there always in the back thats weird that it could do that .,science
but i wonder what that mean a far a using the neural link .,science
and i looked over and the cursor shot over .,science
i had to take a step back .,science
i wa this should not be happening all day .,science
i wa guy do that this work ?,science
i can think it and it happens which theyd all been saying this entire time i can not believe you are doing all this with your mind .,science
i am yeah but is it with my mind ?,science
i am attempting to move and it is picking that up .,science
it doesnt feel it is with my mind .,science
but when i moved it for the first time that it wa man it it made me think that this technology that what i am doing is way way more impressive than i ever thought .,science
it wa way cooler than i ever thought .,science
and it opened up a whole new world of possibility of what could possibly happen with this technology and what i might be able to be capable of with it .,science
because you had felt for the first time this wa digital telepathy you are controlling a digital device with your mind .,science
thats a real moment of discovery .,science
thats cool .,science
youve discovered something .,science
ive seen scientist talk about a big aha moment nobel prize winning .,science
theyll have this holy crap .,science
thats what it felt .,science
i did not feel i felt i had discovered something but for me maybe not necessarily for the world at large or this field at large it felt an aha moment for me .,science
this work .,science
obviously it work .,science
and thats what i do all the time now .,science
i intermix the attempted movement and imagine movement .,science
i do it all together because i found that there is some interplay with it that maximizes efficiency with the cursor .,science
it is not all one or the other .,science
it is not all i only use attempted or i only use imagine movement .,science
it is more i use them in parallel .,science
and i can do one or the other .,science
i can completely think about whatever i am doing .,science
but i do not know .,science
i to play around with it .,science
i also to experiment with these thing .,science
every now and again ill get this idea in my head i wonder if this work .,science
and ill start doing it .,science
and then afterwards ill tell them by the way i wasnt doing that you guy wanted me to .,science
i wa i thought of something and i wanted to try it .,science
maybe we should explore that a little bit .,science
i think that discovery is not for you at least from my perspective thats a discovery for everyone else who ever us a new link that this is possible .,science
i do not think thats an obvious thing that this is even possible .,science
it is i wa saying to bliss earlier it is the four minute mile .,science
people thought it wa impossible to run a mile in four minute .,science
and once the first person did it then everyone started doing it .,science
to show that it is possible that pave the way to anyone can not do it .,science
thats the thing thats possible .,science
you do not need to do the attempted movement .,science
thats crazy .,science
that is crazy .,science
for people who do not know can you explain how the link app work ?,science
you have an amazing stream on the topic .,science
your first stream i think on x describing the app .,science
can you describe how it work ?,science
it is an app that nerlink created to help me interact with the computer .,science
on the link app there are a few different setting and different mode and thing i can do on it .,science
there the body mapping which we touched on .,science
there a calibration .,science
calibration is how i get cursor control .,science
calibrating whats going on in my brain to translate that into cursor control .,science
it will pop out model .,science
what they use i think is time .,science
it would be five minute and calibration will give me good of a model .,science
and then if i am in it for ten minute and fifteen minute the model will progressively get better .,science
and the longer i am in it generally the better the model will get .,science
thats cool because you often refer to the model .,science
the model is the thing thats constructed once you go through the calibration step .,science
and then you also talk about sometimes youll play a difficult game snake to see how good the model is .,science
snake is my litmus test for model .,science
if i can control snake decently then i know i have a pretty good model .,science
yeah the link app ha all of those a web grid in it now .,science
it is also how i connect to the computer in general .,science
theyve given me a lot of voice control with it at this point .,science
i can say connect or implant disconnect .,science
and a long a i have that charger handy then i can connect to it .,science
the charger is also how i connect to the link app to connect to the computer .,science
i have to have the implant charger over my head when i want to connect to have it wake up because the implant in hibernation mode always when i am not using it .,science
i think there a setting to wake it up every long .,science
we could set it to half an hour or five hour or something if i want it to wake up periodically .,science
yeah ill connect to the link app and then go through all sort of thing calibration for the day maybe body mapping .,science
ive made them give me a little homework tab because i am very forgetful and i forget to do thing a lot .,science
i have a lot of data collection thing that they want me to do .,science
is the body mapping part of the data collection ?,science
or is that also part of the collection ?,science
yeah it is .,science
it is something that they want me to do daily which ive been slacking on because ive been doing much medium and traveling much .,science
ive been super famous .,science
yeah ive been a terrible first candidate for how much ive been slacking on my homework .,science
but yeah it is something that they want me to do every day to track how the neuralink is performing over time and have something to give .,science
i imagine to give to the fda to create all sort of fancy chart and stuff and show hey this is what the neuralink this is how it is performing day one versus day ninety versus day one hundred and eighty and thing that .,science
whats the calibration step ?,science
is it move left move ?,science
it is a bubble game .,science
there will be yellow bubble that pop up on the screen .,science
at first it is open loop .,science
open loop this is something that i still do not fully understand the open loop and closed loop thing .,science
blitz talked for a long time about the difference between the two on the technical side. . itd be great to hear your side of the story .,science
open loop is i have no control over the cursor .,science
the cursor will be moving on it own across the screen and i am following by intention the cursor to different bubble .,science
and then my the algorithm is training off of what the signal it is getting are a i am doing this .,science
there are a couple of different way that theyve done it .,science
they call it center out target .,science
there will be a bubble in the middle and then eight bubble around that .,science
and the cursor will go from the middle to one side .,science
say middle to left back to middle to up to middle upright .,science
and theyll do that all the way around the circle .,science
and i will follow that cursor the whole time .,science
and then it will train off of my intention what it is expecting my intention to be throughout the whole process .,science
can you speak to when you say follow ?,science
you do not mean with your eye .,science
you mean with your intention .,science
generally for calibration i am doing attempted movement because i think it work better .,science
i think the better model a i progress through calibration make it easier to use imagined movement .,science
calibrated on attempted movement will create a model that make it effective for you to then use the force .,science
ive tried doing calibration with imagined movement .,science
and it doesnt work a for some reason .,science
that wa the center out target .,science
there also one where a random target will pop up on the screen and it is the same .,science
i follow along with wherever the cursor is to that target all across the screen .,science
ive tried those with imagined movement .,science
and for some reason the model do not they do not give a high level quality when we get into closed loop .,science
i havent played around with it a ton .,science
maybe the different way that we are doing calibration now might make it a bit better .,science
but what ive found is there will be a point in calibration where i can use imagined movement before that point .,science
if i do calibration for forty five minute the first fifteen minute i can not use imagined movement .,science
it doesnt work for some reason .,science
and after a certain point i can feel it .,science
thats the best way i can i can describe it .,science
it is almost a if it is anticipating what i am going to do again before i go to do it .,science
and using attempted movement for fifteen minute at some point i can tell when i move my eye to the next target that the cursor is starting to pick up it is starting to understand it is learning what i am going to do .,science
first of all it is cool that you are a true pioneer in all of this .,science
you are exploring how to do every aspect of this most effectively .,science
and there i imagine many lesson learned from this .,science
thank you for being a pioneer and all these kind of different super technical way .,science
and it is also cool to hear that there a different feeling to the experience when it is calibrated in different way .,science
because i imagine your brain is doing something different .,science
and thats why there a different feeling to it .,science
and then trying to find the word and the measurement to those feeling would be also interesting .,science
but at the end of the day you can also measure that your actual performance on whether it is snake or web grid you can see what work .,science
and you are saying for the open loop calibration the attempted movement work best for now .,science
the open loop you do not get the feedback thats something that you did something .,science
weve done it with a cursor and without a cursor in open loop .,science
sometimes it is say for the center out youll start calibration with a bubble lighting up .,science
and i push towards that bubble .,science
and then when that bubble when it is pushed towards that bubble for say three second a bubble will pop .,science
and then i come back to the middle .,science
i am doing it all by my intention thats what it is learning anyway .,science
it make sense that a long a i follow what they want me to do follow the yellow brick road that itll all work out .,science
your full great reference .,science
is the bubble game fun ?,science
yeah they always feel bad making me do calibration we are about to do a forty minute calibration .,science
i am all would you guy want to do two of them ?,science
i am always asking to whatever they need i am more than happy to do .,science
and it is not it is not bad .,science
it is not bad at all .,science
i do not score that you get can you do better on the bubble game ?,science
no i would love that .,science
i would love writing down suggestion from nolan make it more fun gamified .,science
yeah thats one thing that i enjoy about webgrid is because i am competitive .,science
the higher the bps the higher the score i know the better i am doing .,science
and if i think ive asked at one point one of the guy if he could give me some numerical feedback for calibration i would to know what they are looking at .,science
it is we see this number while you are doing calibration and that mean at least on our end that we think calibration is going .,science
and i would love that because i would to know if what i am doing is going or not .,science
but then theyve also told me yeah not necessarily one to one it doesnt mean that calibration is going in some way .,science
it is not one hundred .,science
and they do not want to skew what i am experiencing or want me to change thing based on that if that number is not always accurate to how the model will turn out or how the end result thats at least what i got from it .,science
one thing i do i have asked them in something that i enjoy striving for is towards the end of calibration there is a time between target .,science
and i to keep at the end that number is low a possible .,science
there you go .,science
thats the way to get a score on the calibration the speed how quickly you can get from bubble to bubble .,science
there the open loop and then it go to the closed loop .,science
and the closed loop can already start giving you a sense because you are getting feedback of how good the model is .,science
closed loop is when i first get cursor control and how theyve described it to me someone who doe not understand this stuff .,science
i am the dumbest person in the room every time i am with any of these guy .,science
is that i am closing the loop .,science
i am now the one that is finishing the loop of whatever this loop is .,science
i do not even know what the loop is .,science
theyve never told me .,science
they say there is a loop and at one point it is open and i can not control and then i get control and it is closed .,science
i am finishing the loop .,science
how long the calibration usually take ?,science
you say ten fifteen minute .,science
yeah they are trying to get that number down pretty low .,science
thats what weve been working on a lot recently is getting that down a low a possible .,science
that way if this is something that people need to do on a daily basis or if some people need to do on a every other day basis or once a week they do not want people to be sitting in calibration for long period of time .,science
i think they wanted to get it down seven minute or below at least where we are at now .,science
itd be nice if they you never had to do calibration .,science
well get there at some point i am sure .,science
the more we learn about the brain and i think thats the dream .,science
i think now for me to get good model i am in calibration forty or forty five minute .,science
and i do not mind i said they always feel bad .,science
but if it is going to get me a model that can break these record on webgrid ill stay in it for flip in two hour .,science
webgrid i saw a presentation that where bliss said by march you selected eighty ninezero target in webgrid .,science
can you explain this game ?,science
what is webgrid ?,science
and what doe it take to be a worldclass performer in webgrid a you continue to break world record ?,science
it is a gold medalist .,science
yeah id to thank everyone who helped me get here my coach my parent for driving me to practice every day at five in the morning .,science
id to thank god and overall my dedication to my craft .,science
the interview with athlete are always that exact .,science
it is that template .,science
it is a grid .,science
they can make it a big or small a you can make a grid .,science
a single box on that grid will light up and you go and click it .,science
and it is a way for them to benchmark how good a bci is .,science
it is pretty straightforward .,science
you click target .,science
only one blue cell appears and you are supposed to move the mouse to there and click on it .,science
i playing on bigger grid because the bigger the grid the more bps it is bit per second that you get every time you click one .,science
ill say ill play on a thirty five by thirty five grid and then one of those little square a cell and call it target whatever will light up and you move the cursor there and you click it and then you do that forever .,science
and youve been able to achieve at first eight bit per second and you recently broke that .,science
yeah i am at eight.five now .,science
i would have beaten that the day before i came to austin but i had a i do not know a five second lag at the end .,science
and i had to wait until the latency calmed down and then i kept clicking but i wa at eight.one and then five second of lag .,science
and then the next three target i clicked all stayed at eight.one .,science
if i would have been able to click during that time of lag i probably would have hit i do not know i might have hit nine .,science
i am there .,science
and then this whole austin trip ha gotten in the way of my web grid playing ability .,science
thats all you are thinking about now .,science
yeah i know .,science
i want to hit nine .,science
i think i know nine is very very achievable .,science
i am there .,science
i think ten i could hit maybe in the next month .,science
i could do it probably in the next few week if i push .,science
i think you and ilana the same person .,science
cause last time i did a podcast with him he came in extremely frustrated that he can not beat uber lilith a a droid .,science
that wa a year ago i think .,science
i forget solo and i could tell there some percentage of his brain the entire time wa thinking i wish i wa now attempting .,science
i think he did it that night .,science
he stayed up and did it that night .,science
it is crazy to me .,science
it is in a fundamental way .,science
and what you are doing is inspiring in that way because it is not about the game .,science
everything you are doing there ha impact .,science
by striving to do on webgrid you are helping everybody figure out how to create the system all along .,science
the decoding the software the hardware the calibration all of it how to make all of that work you can do everything else .,science
yeah it is fun .,science
thats also thats part of the thing is making it fun .,science
yeah it is addicting .,science
ive joked about what they did when they went in and put this thing in my brain .,science
they must have flipped a switch to make me more susceptible to these kind of game to make me addicted to webgrid or something .,science
do bliss high score ?,science
yeah he said fourteen or something .,science
seventeen.one or something ?,science
he told me he doe it on the floor with peanut butter and he fast .,science
that sound cheating .,science
sound performance enhancing .,science
no one the first time no one played this game he asked how could it be at this game ?,science
and i think you told me then you are gon na try to beat me .,science
i am gon na get there someday .,science
i think i can .,science
i am excited for that .,science
yeah ive been playing first off with the dwell cursor which hamper my webgrid playing ability .,science
i have to wait zero.three second for every click .,science
you can not do the click .,science
you have to click by dwelling .,science
you said zero.three ?,science
zero.three second which suck .,science
it slows down how high i am able to get .,science
i still hit fifty i think i hit fifty something trial net trial per minute in that which wa pretty good .,science
because i am able to there one of the setting is also how slow you need to be moving in order to initiate a click to start a click .,science
i can tell when i am on that threshold to start initiating a click a bit early .,science
i am not fully stopped over the target when i go to click .,science
i am doing it on my way to the target a little to try to time it .,science
you are slowing down .,science
yeah a hair before the target .,science
this is a lead performance. . but that still it suck that there a ceiling of the zero.three .,science
i can get down to zero.two and zero.one .,science
zero.one yeah and ive played with that a little bit too .,science
i have to adjust a ton of different parameter in order to play with zero.one .,science
and i do not have control over all that on my end yet .,science
it also change how the model are trained .,science
if i do that with zero.three versus zero.one the model come out different .,science
the way that they interact is much much different .,science
i have to be careful .,science
i found that doing it with zero.three is better in some way unless i can do it with zero.one and change all of the different parameter then thats more ideal because obviously zero.three is faster than zero.one .,science
i could i could get there .,science
i can get there .,science
can you click using your brain ?,science
for now it is the hover clicking with the dwell cursor .,science
before all the thread retraction stuff happened we were calibrating click left click click .,science
that wa my previous ceiling before i broke the record again with the dwell cursor wa i think on a thirty five by thirty five grid with left and click .,science
and you get more bps more bit per second using multiple click because it is more difficult .,science
because what is it ?,science
you are supposed to do either a left click or a click .,science
yes different color .,science
yeah blue target for left click orange target for click is what they had done .,science
my previous record of seven.five wa with the blue and the orange target yeah .,science
which i think if i went back to that now doing the click calibration i would be able to and being able to initiate click on my own i think i would break that ten ceiling in a couple of day .,science
yeah you would start making blizznerus about his seventeen .,science
why do you think we havent given him the exactly ?,science
what did it feel with the retraction that there is some of the thread are attracted ?,science
that sucked .,science
the day they told me wa the day of my big neural link tour at their fremont facility .,science
they told me before we went over there it wa hard to hear .,science
my initial reaction wa all go in fix it go in take it out and fix it .,science
the first surgery wa easy .,science
i went to sleep a couple of hour later i woke up and here we are .,science
i did not feel any pain did not take any pain pill or anything .,science
i knew that if they wanted to they could go in and put in a new one next day if thats what it took .,science
because i wanted it to be better and i wanted not to lose the capability .,science
i had much fun playing with it for a few week for a month .,science
i had it opened up many door for me and it opened up many more possibility that i did not want to lose it after a month .,science
i thought it would have been a cruel twist of fate if i had gotten to see the view from the top of this mountain and then have it all come crashing down after a month .,science
i knew say the top of the mountain but how i saw it wa i wa now starting to climb the mountain .,science
there wa much more that i knew wa possible .,science
to have all of that be taken away wa hard .,science
but then on the drive over to the facility i do not know five minute drive whatever it is i talked with my parent about it .,science
i prayed about it .,science
i wa i am not going to let this ruin my day .,science
i am not going to let this ruin this amazing tour that they have set up for me .,science
i want to go show everyone how much i appreciate all the work they are doing .,science
i want to go meet all of the people who have made this possible and i want to go have one of the best day of my life .,science
i did and it wa amazing and it absolutely wa one of the best day ive ever been privileged to experience .,science
then for a few day i wa pretty down in the dump .,science
but for the first few day afterwards i did not know if it wa ever going to work again .,science
then i made the decision that it even if i lost the ability to use the narrow link even if i lost out on everything to come if i could keep giving them data in any way then i would do that .,science
if i needed to do some of the data collection every day or body mapping every day for a year then i would do it because i know that everything i am doing help everyone to come after me and thats all i wanted .,science
the whole reason that i did this wa to help people and i knew that anything i could do to help i would continue to do even if i never got to use the cursor again .,science
then i wa happy to be a part of it and everything that id done wa a perk .,science
it wa something that i got to experience and i know how amazing it is going to be for everyone to come after me .,science
might a keep trucking along .,science
that said you were able to get to work your way up to get the performance back .,science
this is going from rocky one to rocky two .,science
when did you first realize that this is possible and what gave you the strength the motivation the determination to do it to increase back up and beat your previous record ?,science
yeah it wa within a couple of week .,science
again this feel i am interviewing an athlete .,science
this is great .,science
i to thank my parent .,science
the road back wa long and hard .,science
for many difficulty there were dark day .,science
it wa a couple of week i think and then there wa a turning point .,science
i think they had switched how they were measuring the neuron spike in my brain the bliss helped me out .,science
yeah the way in which we were measuring the behavior of individual neuron .,science
we were switching from individual spike detection to something called spike band power which if you watch the previous segment with either me or dj you probably have some concept .,science
when they did that it wa a light over the head light bulb moment this work and this seems we can run with this .,science
and i saw the uptick in performance immediately .,science
i could feel it when they switched over .,science
i wa this is better .,science
this is good .,science
everything up till this point for the last few week last whatever three or four week because it wa before they even told me everything before this sucked .,science
and at that point it wa not i know i am still only at say in web grid term four or five bps compared to my seven.five before .,science
but i know that if we keep doing this then i can i can get back there .,science
and then they gave me the dwell cursor and the dwell cursor sucked at first .,science
it is not obviously not what i want .,science
but it gave me a path forward to be able to continue using it and hopefully to continue to help out .,science
and i ran with it never looked back .,science
i roll with the punch anyway .,science
what wa the process ?,science
what wa the feedback loop on the figuring out how to do the spike detection in a way that would work for nolan ?,science
yeah it is a great question .,science
maybe describe first how the actual update worked .,science
it wa an update to your implant .,science
we did an over the air software update to his implant .,science
and that firmware changed enabled u to record average of population of neuron nearby individual electrode .,science
we have le resolution about which individual neuron is doing what but we have a broader picture of whats going on nearby an electrode overall .,science
and that feedback a nolan described it wa immediate when we flip that switch .,science
i think the first day we did that you hit three or four bps out of the box .,science
and that wa a light bulb moment for this is the path to go down .,science
and from there there a lot of feedback around how to make this useful for independent use .,science
what we care about ultimately is that you can use it independently to do whatever you want .,science
and to get to that point it required u to re engineer the ux a you talked about the dwell cursor to make it something that you can use independently without u needing to be involved all the time .,science
and yeah this is obviously the start of this journey still hopefully we get back to the place where you are doing multiple click and using that to control much more fluidly everything and much more naturally the application that you are trying to interface with .,science
and most importantly get that web grid number up .,science
how is the on the hover click do accidentally click self sometimes ?,science
whats how hard is it to avoid accidentally clicking ?,science
i have to continuously keep it moving .,science
i said there a threshold where it will initiate a click .,science
if i ever drop below that itll start and i have zero.three second to move it before it click anything .,science
and if i do not want it to ever get there i keep it moving at a certain speed and constantly doing circle on screen moving it back and forth to keep it from clicking stuff .,science
i have to avoid the clicking .,science
i guess doe that create problem when you are gaming accidentally click a thing ?,science
yeah yeah it happens in chess .,science
ive lost a number of game because ill accidentally click something .,science
i think the first time i ever beat you wa because of an accident .,science
yeah miss click .,science
it is a nice excuse ?,science
yeah you can always anytime you lose you could say it wa accidental .,science
you said the app improved a lot from version one when you first started using it .,science
it wa very different .,science
can you talk about the trial and error that you went through with the team ?,science
two hundred plus page of note ?,science
whats that process of going back and forth and working together to improve the thing ?,science
it is a lot of me using it day in and day out and saying hey can you guy do this for me ?,science
give me this .,science
i want to be able to do that .,science
i need this .,science
i think a lot of it doesnt occur to them maybe until someone is using the app using the implant .,science
it is something that they never would have thought of or it is very specific to even me maybe what i want .,science
thats a dumb idea .,science
why would he ask for that ?,science
and i am looking forward to get the next people on because i guarantee that they are going to think of thing that ive never thought of .,science
they are going to think of improvement .,science
i am wow thats a good idea .,science
i wish i would have thought of that .,science
and then they are also going to give me some pushback about yeah what you are asking them to do here .,science
thats a bad idea .,science
let do it this way .,science
and i am more than happy to have that happen .,science
but it is a lot of different interaction with different game or application the internet with the computer in general there ton of bug that end up popping up left center .,science
it is me trying to use it a much a possible and showing them what work and what doesnt work and what i would to be better .,science
and then they take that feedback and they usually create amazing thing for me .,science
they solve these problem in way i would have never imagined .,science
they are good at everything they do .,science
and i am thankful that i am able to give them feedback and they can make something of it .,science
because a lot of my feedback is dumb .,science
it is i want this please do something about it .,science
and well come back super thought out .,science
and it is way better than anything i could have ever thought of or implemented myself .,science
they are great .,science
they are cool .,science
a the bci community grows would you to hang out with the other folk with neural link ?,science
what relationship of any would you want to have with them ?,science
because you said they might have a different set of idea of how to use the thing .,science
would you be intimidated by their webgrade performance ?,science
i hope day one they wipe the floor with me .,science
i hope they beat it .,science
and they crush it double it if they can .,science
because on one hand it is only going to push me to be better .,science
i want other people to push me .,science
i think that is important for anyone trying to achieve greatness is they need other people around them who are going to push them to be better .,science
and i even made a joke about it on x once once the next people get chosen q buddy cop music i am excited to have other people to do this with and to share experience with .,science
i am more than happy to interact with them a much a they want more than happy to give them advice .,science
i do not know what advice i could give them .,science
but if they have question i am more than happy .,science
what advice would you have for the next participant in the clinical trial ?,science
that they should have fun with this because it is a lot of fun .,science
and that i hope they work hard because it is not for u . it is for everyone that come after u . and come to me if they need anything and to go to the neuralink if they need anything .,science
they do absolutely anything for me that they can .,science
and it is an amazing support system to have .,science
it put my mind at ease for many thing that i have had question about many thing i want to do .,science
and they are always there .,science
and thats nice .,science
and i i would tell them not to be afraid to go to neuralink with any question that they have any concern anything that they are looking to do with this and any help that neuralink is capable of providing .,science
i know they will .,science
and i do not know .,science
work your as off because it is important that we try to give our all to this .,science
have fun and work hard .,science
there we go .,science
maybe thats what ill start saying to people .,science
have fun work hard .,science
now you are a real pro athlete .,science
maybe it is good to talk about what youve been able to do now that you have a neuralink implant the freedom you gain from this way of interacting with the outside world .,science
you play video game all night and you do that by yourself .,science
and thats a freedom .,science
can you speak to that freedom that you gain ?,science
yeah it is what all i do not know .,science
people in my position want .,science
they want more independence .,science
the more load that i can take away from people around me the better .,science
if i am able to interact with the world without using my family without going through any of my friend needing them to help me with thing the better .,science
it take a load off of all of u . and it is all i can ask for .,science
it is something that i could never think nearly enough for .,science
i know my family feel the same way .,science
being able to have the freedom to do thing on my own at any hour of the day or night it mean the world to me .,science
when you are up at two a.m. playing webgrid by yourself i imagine it is darkness and then you are a light glowing and you are focused .,science
whats going through your mind ?,science
are you in a state of flow where the mind is empty those zen master ?,science
generally it is me playing music of some sort .,science
i have a massive playlist and i am rocking out to music .,science
and then it is also a race against time because i am constantly looking at how much battery percentage i have left on my implant .,science
i have thirty which equates to x amount of time which mean i have to break this record in the next hour and a half or else it is not happening tonight .,science
and it is a little stressful when that happens .,science
when it is above fifty i am i got time .,science
it start getting down to thirty and then twenty .,science
it is all ten a little popup is going to pop up here and it is going to screw my webgrid flow .,science
it is going to tell me that there a low battery popup come up and i am it is going to screw me over .,science
if i am going to break this record i have to do it in the next thirty second or else that popup is going to get in the way cover my webgrid .,science
and then after that i go click on it go back into webgrid and i am all that mean i have ten minute left before this thing dead .,science
thats whats going on in my head generally that in whatever song is playing .,science
and i want to break those record bad .,science
it is all i want when i am playing webgrid .,science
it ha become le of this is a leisurely activity .,science
i enjoy doing this because it feel nice and it put me at ease .,science
once i am in webgrid you better break this record or you are going to waste five hour of your life now .,science
and i do not know it is fun .,science
it is fun man .,science
have you ever tried webgrid with two target and three target ?,science
can you get higher bps with that ?,science
can you do that ?,science
you mean different color target ?,science
or you mean ?,science
ha that changed the thing ?,science
bps is a log of number of target time correct minus incorrect divided by time .,science
and you can think of different click a double the number of active target .,science
you higher bps the more option there are the more difficult the task .,science
and there also zen mode youve played in before which is infinite canvas .,science
it cover the whole screen with a grid and i do not know .,science
and you can go thats insane .,science
he doesnt it because it did not show bps .,science
i had them put in a giant bps in the background .,science
now it is the opposite of zen mode .,science
it is it is super hard mode metal mode of it a giant number in the back count .,science
we should name that metal mode is not much better .,science
you also play civilization six .,science
usually go with korea .,science
the great part about korea is they focus on science tech victory which wa not planned .,science
ive been playing korea for year and then all of the nerling stuff happened .,science
and if you want to win a domination victory you get to a certain point with the science and then go and wipe out the rest of the world .,science
or you can take science all the way and win that way .,science
and you are going to be far ahead of everyone because you are producing much science that it is not even close .,science
ive accidentally won in different way by focusing on science .,science
i wa playing only science obviously science all the way tech .,science
and i wa trying to get every tech in the tech tree and stuff .,science
and then i accidentally won through a diplomatic victory and i wa mad .,science
i wa mad because it end the game one turn and it wa you won .,science
i am i do not want to do this .,science
i should have declared war on more people or something .,science
it wa terrible .,science
but you do not need giant civilization with tech especially with korea .,science
you can keep it pretty small .,science
i generally get to a certain military unit and put them all around my border to keep everyone out .,science
and then i will build up .,science
very isolationist .,science
work on the science .,science
thats it .,science
you are making it sound fun .,science
it is much fun .,science
and i also saw a civilization seven trailer .,science
and thats probably coming out .,science
come on sim7 .,science
ill alpha beta test whatever .,science
wait when is it coming out ?,science
two thousand and twenty five .,science
yeah yeah next year .,science
what other stuff would you to see improved about the new orleans cap and the entire experience ?,science
i would to i said get back to the click on demand the regular click .,science
that would be great .,science
i would to be able to connect to more device .,science
now it is the computer .,science
id to be able to use it on my phone or use it on different console different platform .,science
id to be able to control a much stuff a possible honestly .,science
an optimus robot would be pretty cool .,science
that would be sick if i could control an optimus robot .,science
the link app itself it seems we are getting pretty dialed in to what it might look down the road .,science
seems weve gotten through a lot of what i want from it at least .,science
the only other thing i would say is more control over all the parameter that i can tweak with my cursor and stuff .,science
there a lot of thing that go into how the cursor move in certain way .,science
i have i do not know three or four of those parameter .,science
gain and friction and all that .,science
gain friction yeah .,science
there maybe double the amount of those with velocity and then with the actual dwell cursor .,science
i would all of it .,science
i want a much control over my environment a possible especially .,science
you want advanced mode .,science
there menu usually in this basic mode and you are one of those folk the power user advanced .,science
thats what i want .,science
i want a much control over this a possible .,science
thats all i can ask for .,science
give me everything .,science
being able to talk also in addition to everything else ?,science
you mean while i am using it ?,science
while you are using it speech to text ?,science
or do you type or look because there also a keyboard ?,science
there a virtual keyboard .,science
thats another thing i would to work more on is finding some way to type or text in a different way .,science
now it is a dictation and a virtual keyboard that i can use with the cursor .,science
but weve played around with finger spelling sign language finger spelling .,science
and that seems promising .,science
i have this thought in my head that it is going to be a very similar learning curve that i had with the cursor where i went from attempted movement to imagined movement at one point .,science
i have a feeling this is my intuition that at some point i am going to be doing finger spelling and i will not need to attempt to finger spell anymore that ill be able to think the letter that i want and itll pop up .,science
that would be epic .,science
thats challenging .,science
thats hard .,science
thats a lot of work for you to take that leap .,science
that would be awesome .,science
and then going from letter to word is another step you would go from now it is finger spelling of the sign language alphabet .,science
but if it is able to pick that up then it should be able to pick up the whole sign language language .,science
and then if i could do something along those line or the sign language spelled word if i can spell it at a reasonable speed and it can pick that up then i would be able to think that through and it would do the same thing .,science
i do not see why not after what i saw with the cursor control .,science
i do not see why it wouldnt work but wed have to play around with it more .,science
what wa the process in term of training yourself to go from attempted movement to imagine movement ?,science
how long doe that take ?,science
how long would this process take ?,science
it wa a couple week before it happened upon me .,science
but now that i know that that wa possible i think i could make it happen with other thing .,science
i think it would be much much simpler .,science
would you get an upgraded implant device ?,science
sure absolutely .,science
whenever theyll let me .,science
you do not have any concern for you with the surgery experience ?,science
all of it wa no regret ?,science
everythings been good far ?,science
why not ?,science
ive seen how much it is impacted my life already .,science
and i know that everything from here on out is going to get better and better .,science
i would love to get the upgrade .,science
what future capability are you excited about ?,science
beyond this telepathy ?,science
is vision interesting ?,science
for folk who for example who are blind enabling people to see or for speech ?,science
yeah there a lot thats very very cool about this .,science
we are talking about the brain .,science
there this is motor cortex stuff .,science
there much more that can be done .,science
the vision one is fascinating to me .,science
i think that is going to be very very cool to give someone the ability to see for the first time in their life would be it might be more amazing than even helping someone me .,science
that sound incredible .,science
the speech thing is interesting being able to have some real time translation and cut away that language barrier would be cool .,science
any actual impairment that it could solve with speech would be very very cool .,science
and then also there are a lot of different disability that all originate in the brain .,science
and you would be able to hopefully be able to solve a lot of those .,science
i know there already stuff to help people with seizure that can be implanted in the brain .,science
this would do i imagine the same thing .,science
and you could do something that .,science
i know that even someone joe rogan ha talked about the possibility with being able to stimulate the brain in different way .,science
i am not sure what how ethical a lot of that would be .,science
thats beyond me honestly .,science
but i know that there a lot that can be done when we are talking about the brain and being able to go in and physically make change to help people or to improve their life .,science
i am looking forward to everything that come from this .,science
and i do not think it is all that far off .,science
i think a lot of this can be implemented within my lifetime assuming that i live a long life .,science
what you were referring to is thing people suffering from depression or thing of that nature potentially getting help .,science
flip a switch that make someone happy .,science
i know i think joe ha talked about it more in term of you want to experience what a drug trip feel .,science
you want to experience what you to be on .,science
of course .,science
yeah mushroom or something that .,science
dmt you can flip that switch in the brain .,science
my buddy bain ha talked about being able to wipe part of your memory and reexperience thing that for the first time your favorite movie or your favorite book wipe that out real quick and then refall in love with harry potter or something .,science
i told him i wa i do not know how i feel about people being able to wipe part of your memory .,science
that seems a little sketchy to me .,science
he they are already doing it .,science
sound legit .,science
i would love memory replay high resolution replay of old memory .,science
i saw an episode of black mirror about that once .,science
i do not think i want it .,science
black mirror always considers the worst case which is important .,science
i think people do not consider the best case or the average case enough .,science
i do not know what it is about u human .,science
we want to think about the worst possible thing .,science
it is how is this new technology going to kill everybody ?,science
we love that .,science
we are getting yes let watch .,science
hopefully people do not think about that too much with me .,science
itll ruin a lot of my plan .,science
i assume you are going to have to take over the world .,science
i love your twitter .,science
you tweeted id to make joke about hearing voice in my head since getting the neuralink but i feel people would take it the wrong way .,science
plus the voice in my head told me not to .,science
please never stop .,science
you were talking about optimus .,science
is that something you would love to be able to do to control the robotic arm of the entirety of optimus ?,science
yeah for sure .,science
you think there something fundamentally different about being able to physically interact with the world ?,science
i know another thing with being able to give people the ability to feel sensation and stuff too by going in with the brain and having the neuralink maybe do that .,science
that could be something that could be translated through transferred through the optimus a . there all sort of cool interplay between that .,science
and then also you said physically interacting .,science
ninety nine of the thing that i can not do myself obviously need i need a caretaker for someone to physically do thing for me .,science
if an optimus robot could do that i could live an incredibly independent life and not be such a burden on those around me .,science
and that would it would change the way people me live at least until whatever this is get cured .,science
but being able to interact with the world physically that would be amazing .,science
and they are not for having it be a caretaker or something but something i talked about being able to read a book .,science
imagine optimus robot being able to hold a book open in front of me get that smell again .,science
i might not be able to feel it at that point .,science
or maybe i could again with the sensation and stuff .,science
but there something different about reading a physical book than staring at a screen or listening to an audiobook .,science
ive listened to a ton of them at this point but i do not them .,science
i would much rather read a physical copy .,science
one of the thing you would love to be able to experience is opening the book bringing it up to you and to feel the touch of the paper .,science
man the touch the smell .,science
it is something about the word on the page .,science
theyve replicated that page color on the kindle and stuff .,science
yeah it is not the same .,science
something a simple a that .,science
one of the thing you miss is touch ?,science
a lot of thing that i interact with in the world clothes or any physical thing that i interact with in the world a lot of time what people around me will do is theyll come rub it on my face .,science
theyll lay something on me i can feel the weight .,science
they will rub a shirt on me i can feel fabric .,science
there something very profound about touch and it is something that i miss a lot and something i would love to do again .,science
what would be the first thing you do with the hand that can touch ?,science
you can mama hug after that yeah .,science
something along those line being able to interact with the people around me handshake give someone a hug anything that .,science
being able to help me eat id probably get fat which would be a terrible terrible thing .,science
also beat bliss and chess on a physical chessboard .,science
there are many upside .,science
any way to find some way to feel i am bringing bliss down to my level because he such an amazing guy and everything about him is above and beyond that anything i can do to take him down a notch .,science
he need it .,science
yeah. . a he sitting next to me .,science
did you ever make sense of why god put good people through such hardship ?,science
i think it is all about understanding how much we need god .,science
and i do not think that there any light without the dark .,science
i think that if all of u were happy all the time there would be no reason to turn to god ever .,science
i feel there would be no concept of good or bad .,science
and i think that a much of the darkness and the evil thats in the world it make u all appreciate the good and the thing we have much more .,science
and he said if anything seeing me go through this accident he belief that there is not a god .,science
and it is a very different reaction .,science
i think thats a huge part of being here is to not have an easy life and do everything thats easy but to step out of our comfort zone and challenge ourselves because i think thats how we grow .,science
what give you hope about this whole thing we have going on ?,science
human civilization ?,science
man i think people are my biggest inspiration even being at new orleans for a few month looking people in the eye and hearing their motivation for why they are doing this .,science
and i know that they could be other place at cushier job working somewhere else doing x y or z that doesnt mean that much .,science
but instead they are here and they want to better humanity and they want to better the people around them the people that theyve interacted with in their life .,science
they want to make better life for their own family member who might have disability or they look at someone me and they say i can do something about that .,science
and it is always been what ive connected with most in the world are people .,science
it give me a lot of hope for humanity in general how much we care and how much we are capable of when we all get together and try to make a difference .,science
and i know there a lot of bad out there in the world but there always ha been and there always will be .,science
and i think that that is it show human resiliency and it show what we are able to endure and how much .,science
how much we want to be there and help each other and how much satisfaction we get from that because i think thats one of the reason that we are here is to help each other .,science
and i do not know that that always give me hope is realizing that there are people out there who still care and who want to help .,science
and thank you for being one such human being and continuing to be a great human being through everything youve been through and being an inspiration to many people to myself for many reason including your epic unbelievably great performance on webgrid .,science
i will be training all night tonight to try to catch up .,science
and i believe in you that you can once you come back sorry to interrupt with the austin trip once you come back eventually beat bliss .,science
yeah yeah for sure .,science
i am rooting for you .,science
the whole world is rooting for you .,science
thank you for everything youve done .,science
thanks man .,science
thanks for listening to this conversation with nolan arbaugh and before that with elon musk dj saw matthew mcdougal and bliss chapman to support this podcast .,science
please check out our sponsor in the description .,science
and now let me leave you with some word from aldous huxley in the door of perception .,science
we live together .,science
we act on and react to one another .,science
but always and in all circumstance we are by ourselves .,science
the martyr go hand in hand into the arena .,science
they are crucified alone .,science
embrace the lover desperately tried to fuse their insulated ecstasy into a single self transcendence in vain .,science
but it is very nature .,science
every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy it solitude .,science
sensation feeling insight fancy all these are private and accept through symbol and a second hand incommunicable .,science
we can pull information about experience but never the experience themselves from family to nation .,science
every human group is a society of island universe .,science
thank you for listening and hope to see you next time .,science
hello everybody and welcome to the latest episode of this week in science .,science
we are in the premoment of the show when i tell you all that hey we are about to do this thing .,science
thats a podcast broadcast .,science
and we are live now .,science
there will probably be little blip and blurb and mistake probably because i am here .,science
and when there are our wonderful editor rachel will edit them out for the podcast .,science
if you want the unedited or the unedited video version stay here wherever you are .,science
if you want the edited podcast version find u and subscribe to u this week in science wherever you find podcasts .,science
justin do you think you are ready to do a show ?,science
by the way sometimes ive never missed a show in episode .,science
but sometimes the podcast audience will not hear me .,science
thats because ive made many mistake in editing that they had to completely edit me out of the show .,science
what you are getting here though is the raw feed .,science
i hope because this one because claires not here tonight youll be the it would be me talking until the interview .,science
she wa terrible .,science
she had to be edited out even out of the raw broadcast of the show .,science
rachel that good .,science
she can do it in real time .,science
you ready to start ?,science
can i on that can i i am gon na one last side track .,science
i have i wrote a story a while ago that got shared a thousand time .,science
in the social medias .,science
that translated into almost four hundredzero view of one story .,science
every time you share you are not necessarily sharing it with one person or one group of people .,science
you can be generating hundred of additional view which is what the algorithm is looking for .,science
what wa the engagement factor of this ?,science
they are not looking for the searchable word in an audio podcast but they are gon na look at how many people saw this pop up in their feed somewhere and took a look at it .,science
it is a bigger deal than i think people realize when you put it out there repost a thing and share it out there .,science
it always help .,science
it always help .,science
it is time to start our show .,science
everybody are you ready for u to begin our show in three two this is twis .,science
this week in science episode number nine hundred and ninety one recorded on wednesday october 23rd two thousand and twenty four .,science
how much toilet water would you drink ?,science
i am dr. kiki and tonight on this week in science we are going to fill your head with ovary polar bear and polarized people but first ... disclaimer disclaimer disclaimer .,science
the following hour of programming contains science .,science
if you are allergic to science science ha a remedy .,science
if you think science is boring science will reveal it wonder .,science
if you do not know what science is science ha an answer .,science
if you are afraid of science science will protect you .,science
if you question science or skeptical about it science invite your curiosity .,science
if science seems confusing science can clarify .,science
if you think science is too complicated science can be super simplified .,science
if science feed your thirst for knowledge fuel your imagination and fill your brain with reasoned thinking youve come to the place because we have all of that and more here on this week in science coming up next .,science
with new discovery that happen every day of the week there only one place to go to find the knowledge i seek .,science
i want to know whats happening whats happening whats happening this week in science .,science
whats happening whats happening whats happening this week in science .,science
and a good science to you too justin and everyone out there .,science
unfortunately blair is not joining u this week for the show but well be talking about her polar bear .,science
yes they are her polar bear .,science
happy molday everyone .,science
it is .,science
ten to the 23rd ?,science
six.twenty two time ten to the 23rd .,science
what that number is ?,science
i am going to have to go back to theyve been adding a few people been claiming number .,science
now that it is a name generator out there .,science
intranged avocado number .,science
yeah i do not know .,science
there must be .,science
ai is taking over .,science
these little mistake the blip in space time in the fabric of our reality .,science
this is this week in science .,science
and thank you everyone for joining u for this episode .,science
we are glad that you are here and we have a great show ahead including an interview with pepperdine university professor dr. steve rouse on learning to love toilet water or at least to learn how to drink it without complaining .,science
we also have .,science
before we get into this too deeply i want everybody who had any visceral reaction to understand that all water that you encounter in this world wa at some point somebody else threw that water .,science
from fish to bacteria to any other organism that ha been on this planet .,science
that water ha passed through or been used a toilet water .,science
you think it did .,science
this concept is the it is not all new water .,science
are we having this conversation now ?,science
no we are going to wait for our guest to join u . before we get our shock factor too high up it is all toilet water .,science
it is toilet water all the way down .,science
i have story tonight about tasmanian tiger simulating social medium and the best human bias ever .,science
what do you have for u justin ?,science
my goodness .,science
i wrote down the thing that i brought .,science
what do i have ?,science
this is going to be fun .,science
realtime ovulation .,science
yeah i brought it .,science
i brought the ovulation .,science
you brought it .,science
thank you .,science
and then separate story .,science
dulas study on dulas found them massively improving health outcome .,science
it is a medicaid study which is going to be important because it recently got expanded .,science
and maybe a silver lining of global warming .,science
and we are without blair .,science
ive also got a few other thing that i pulled up that we may get to if time permit .,science
i would ask blair whats in the animal corner .,science
she wa going to talk about polar bear paw .,science
and maybe ill bring the story up without a much detail a she wa going to before the end of the show .,science
but now i want to let that if you are enjoying the show you do not have u already subscribed and everything .,science
if you want to do that find u a this week in science podcast wherever your favorite podcasts are found .,science
and we broadcast live weekly on youtube facebook and twitch wednesday eight p.m. pacific timeish .,science
but you can find all the information at our website twist.org .,science
time for the science .,science
this story i did bring because blair wa going to be here tonight .,science
and i figured it would be a fun little i do not know a little needle for both of you .,science
but weve been talking about deextinction for a long time on the show .,science
colossal the company thats been trying to restore the mammoth .,science
theyve also talked about deextincting the dodo .,science
and recently the thylacine .,science
and blair love the thylacine .,science
the thylacine is the tasmanian tiger .,science
or more accurately because it is not a tiger specie it is more closely related to wolf and dog the tasmanian wolf .,science
colossal ha been working with university of melbourne and researcher at in a lab there thats working on specifically marsupial specie run by a researcher named andrew pask .,science
and they announced several advancement not through publication not through peer review but in a south by southwest australia panel discussion this last week .,science
the timing interestingly coincides with the launch of their colossal foundation which is raising money for investment .,science
and that they say will be spent to rapidly deploy to help with extinction and research around the world .,science
it is an interesting thing .,science
it is science by press releaseish .,science
it is not this far hasnt been peer reviewed .,science
and we do hope that it will be peer reviewed .,science
but what they say theyve been doing is fascinating .,science
number one they have been working in this deextinction process on the genome of a related specie of marsupial that they are going to be using .,science
and they are starting to use to bring the tasmanian tiger back .,science
the researcher have been trying to work on this related specie and make sure see what the specific genetic difference are that they can genetically modify it and turn it into a tasmanian tiger .,science
and this specie is called the fattailed dunnert .,science
the fattailed dunnert is most closely related to the tasmanian tiger ha ninety nine or ninety nine.nine relatedness .,science
and the exciting part of what theyve been working on here is that they have developed new method to or they are developing new method to do genome editing at multiple point without massive amount of offtarget effect .,science
offtarget effect are the change in the genome that you do not want to be happening in place where they might have condition deletion these sort of thing .,science
and far in this in genetic modification whether crispr or any other methodology you do not usually have it happening in lot of place at the same time .,science
it is usually at very limited location and very highly controlled .,science
if this technology were to become applicable it might have influence and application in all sort of genetic modification for many different specie for reproductive purpose .,science
i am not pointing at my own head now .,science
one of the thing i do not know if i missurge you or want to clarify this is not related to canine specie at all .,science
it is a marsupial .,science
it is a marsupial .,science
it look a wolf .,science
it look a wolf .,science
but it is not related any more to a wolf than it would be to a tiger or a dolphin. ?,science
le closely .,science
because it is a young adult .,science
thats why i think it wa always fascinating .,science
because if you look at it you are thats a canine .,science
thats a dog or a wolf specie for sure .,science
and the reason i said the more ... it is a convergent type of an evolution .,science
but that make their job more difficult because you could use a wolf or a fox or some canine specie to infill if you are missing data or something this .,science
the woolly mammoth they are doing with the elephant .,science
our missing section of woolly mammoth dna .,science
we can use a close ... yeah .,science
let me move on from this because this is what theyve been doing because of the convergent similarity of these animal to the canid .,science
the jaw and skull morphology is similar in it length and breadth .,science
the thylacine craniofacial shape theyve been analyzing genetic segment that are related to how the face develops .,science
and they messed with the whole bunch of region of the genome and what they call thylacine wolf accelerated region .,science
and they predict that they will drive similarity between thylacine and wolf .,science
theyve tested them these gene segment on knockin experiment in mouse .,science
and they found the mouse skull moved in predicted way and confirmed the driver of head shape and the change that would happen there .,science
they are starting to put those genetic edits into the fat tailed dunnert embryo .,science
and then additionally they found a head in a jar at a museum of a thylacine head .,science
and it is grotesque in a preserved head but they could take tissue from the head and they sampled it .,science
we are able to get the most complete genome of a thylacine to date .,science
they are only missing a few segment in between bit and piece .,science
and they think that they can fill those in based on understanding of this relation between morphology and function .,science
and they think they can fit it in .,science
that said they also were able to get mrna messenger rna which is indicative of the bit of the genome which are being translated into protein within the head region .,science
they believe that they have marker telling them which protein were being turned on or were active before this individual in the jar died for the muscle for the eye for the brain that these little bit of instruction would have been relevant .,science
and that this is important for understanding how a living animal should be .,science
this is not to say that they are there yet .,science
this is not to say it is peer reviewed but there a whole bunch going .,science
they also want to put cane toad resistance gene into their thylacine remake because there too many cane toad in australia and they do not want to .,science
you are creating a food network web that eliminates an invasive specie .,science
thats very clever .,science
and that will probably then of course allow them to get tremendous funding .,science
yeah that they might save the quaka a . i find the convergent evolution genetic portion of this very fascinating .,science
it is one thing thats it is an evolutionary trait the long snout .,science
you can see it with tiger and lion .,science
if you compare the two that lion have a longer snout .,science
no tiger have a very short snout compared to the lion projected face .,science
now i need to look at picture .,science
and what the those difference are especially if you look through lot of specie different specie and where they exist tiger are very of the cat family have the longest .,science
they are also the most prominent plane hunter .,science
what theyve found is it ha to do with partly to do with the distance vision and having that snout .,science
how those two correlate to the evolutionary path but it tends to be open plane animal that are predator especially but have these longer snout versus more jungle or condensed area tends to have flatter face .,science
it ha to do with the long range vision .,science
and and that make it did not it did not occur to me at all that that you could potentially use convergent pathway that to control morphology .,science
it is very fascinating .,science
hopefully though if they have a head and a jar and they have a pretty decent genome that they might not need to to borrow for those trait but it is it is a very fascinating idea that you could have convergent dna not trait .,science
and i wa once again i wa incorrect .,science
i said quaca it is the qual cute little specie that i am very sad to be sharing is becoming endangered because of cane toad .,science
look at this cutie pie .,science
it can not it need to be able to protect itself from the cane toad .,science
it need to be able to eat toad .,science
the question is now doe the doe this company colossal they say they have they want to help save the specie that may go extinct ?,science
to help u if we can not change our way to protect and save specie that we cause to go extinct in the near future .,science
based on the thing that they find .,science
i wish that it were not a much of a company company colossal is but they have to make money .,science
it is an interesting it is an interest .,science
this is the interesting balancing point between science and industry or science and private or market .,science
and i am questioning .,science
and this is probably a wrong time to bring this up because you might be unfamiliar .,science
and then we are i do not know .,science
ha colossal done anything ?,science
i feel colossal ha been raising fund for two hundred and thirty five million dollar and some thirteen lab or something that around the world that they are collaborating with .,science
they have published a couple of study and they are working towards thing .,science
i do not know whether this ha already resulted in patent or any intellectual property that would be valuable at this point .,science
but that i think is what the concern is that they are not creating intellectual property that will be public domain if they are not publishing and not undergoing peer review .,science
i am following along and ill keep everyone posted to what i learned .,science
but i think it is very fascinating .,science
we are not going to get a tasmanian title .,science
i am very fascinated with the idea of using convergent evolution .,science
i also do not think of a word .,science
i also think yeah but you are talking about developmental trigger of growth and bone and thing it is i can see .,science
yeah but craniofacial morphology is different from we have convergent evolution to a similar shape and function .,science
and that is a they are seeing probably driven by very related gene .,science
there are certain gene that way back when became the driver of form .,science
and we know we know what a lot of them are how they are related and how they work specifically during development in various specie is the interesting question .,science
and then again this marsupial specie what are they going to do when the baby tasmanian tiger slash fat tail dunnart is ready to not be born yet but is a little marsupial baby who want to be in the pouch ?,science
do they have a marsupial pouch ?,science
what are they working on ?,science
this is good technology .,science
you want to show me what it is to ovulate ?,science
this is this story is a cool video on one on one level .,science
the other is this is from the max planck institute of multidisciplinary science .,science
they created a live imaging method that us my microscopy to do a time lapse .,science
they did a twenty four hour x vitro .,science
in a lab they grew mouse ovary .,science
and with this new technique that theyve designed they captured the process at ten minute interval over twenty four hour .,science
and it allowed them amazing amazing detail of information .,science
i do not know if you have the link there if you can pull up a video for the streaming audience to figure out .,science
but they also made tremendous discovery in this .,science
normally when you are doing these tissue study ovary are difficult to study .,science
they are hard to get at where they are .,science
and you have to have the timing exactly .,science
for the sorry for the ovulation .,science
it is a very quick process of releasing the egg .,science
and getting this live imaging instead of having sample that are in slice of time where you have captured an ovary in some stage of development and then you can study it at this point or at that point or of the egg .,science
you got to see the entire process .,science
it came in three phase .,science
it is beginning to be released from the skin tissue the follicle .,science
where is my i have to go and look for my yes .,science
it is there a follicle expansion then it contract rupture and then the egg is released .,science
and it manages to capture all of this .,science
i am guessing this wa they had egg in a dish probably donated .,science
and no these were these are mouse egg .,science
donated by mouse .,science
and these are transgenic mouse that they have the coloration they have marker that allow it to show up in the imaging .,science
but with this they were also able to compare it to level of different chemical release at different time point .,science
and that gave them an idea of what wa driving the process of ovulation .,science
and then they did knockout model of each of these chemical to confirm that they were a causal role .,science
and their knockout would prevent this that or the other from happening .,science
and they got a not a nice video they did answer a lot of question or confirm a lot of theory about how ovulation work .,science
a remarkable a remarkable study which is the core of this it is lab tech .,science
these image were captured using a combination of con focal and twophoton microscopy .,science
they did this live imaging over the twenty four hour plus they were also able to do chemical testing at the different stage because this is in a this is lab dish created they have access to these .,science
i think yeah the interesting thing is putting all the piece together to make this possible within the lab but then starting to get at what what question is this going to answer ?,science
and how is this going to advance maybe problem with ovulation when why do you get ovarian cyst ?,science
why do some why do some ovulation go bad ?,science
why do you release many egg sometimes ?,science
there many individual question that can go a little bit deeper into looking at the the various layer of data that theyve put together here .,science
and it give it give a causal chemical release hormone release interaction for each of the stage of the three stage that they they point out and then the actual rupture ha it own three stage built within that .,science
each one triggered by something .,science
and and knowing what all of the mechanism are then you can interrogate within a human model .,science
are we are we missing one of these ?,science
do we have a genetic variant that is preventing one of these release ?,science
yeah some part of this .,science
and because youve seen all of it in the time lapse process you what should be happening when and when it doesnt .,science
something that is almost impossible to do when you have a sample and say this look it is at that time point .,science
and we can study what seems to be going on at this time point .,science
now you have the full picture .,science
it is fascinating .,science
that is super cool .,science
more stuff .,science
i want more video of thing that usually happen inside the body .,science
i think that would be cool .,science
let make that stuff visible .,science
it would be great .,science
unfortunately blair not here to talk about this but people are looking at polar bear .,science
we worry about polar bear these day a they are the called canary in the coal mine of our arctic area and the melting ice cap .,science
apparently a new study published in ecology the ecological society of america journal scientific naturalist stephen atkinson and kristen ladra are publishing their work icingrelated injury in polar bear at high latitude .,science
polar bear who we normally think of a being able to jump and run across the ice and theyve got the thick pad and theyve got lot of fur and everythings supposed to be perfect for their adaptation to that environment .,science
this is the first time that injury to the foot skin ulceration ice buildup hair loss laceration have been reported .,science
apparently two bear had ice block up to one foot in diameter stuck to their foot pad which made it difficult for them to walk .,science
this is probably a result of this transition in our climate and understanding how the melting ice and refreezing of the ice is affecting the animal that live on the ice and their ability to function and survive is incredibly important .,science
they have looked at these bear in two different population in the arctic between canada and greenland and theyve found number of bear that have lot of ice ball stuck to their foot these laceration .,science
the bear are not happy .,science
thats where we are ending up .,science
i feel we talked about this a long time ago but one of the thing that prevents that in all kind of polar specie is having these hair on the paw .,science
they have hair on the paw .,science
but i am wondering if they are not a developed now or do you think it is the ice is changed ?,science
because one of the thing that also that came up in all of this wa that it wa an epigenetic factor that it could have been sourced in the prenatal hormone release from the mother and that it wa likely because of a more relaxed le stress hormone .,science
and if those stress hormone are rising and it is affecting development that could be affecting the hair follicle deployment on the paw and then therefore you would have what we are seeing .,science
there also another report thats out from in close one .,science
it is showing that toxoplasmosis is up in polar bear that they are a number of pathogen that they are encountering .,science
maybe because they previously had not .,science
it is interesting .,science
the author for this study hypothesized that it is all related to climate warming rain on snow event creating moist slushy snow that freeze onto the paw of the animal warm spell causing melting and then refreezing .,science
and then maybe this is the third is that the population live on whats called fast ice connected to the land near where freshwater glacier meet the ocean .,science
and that this mean that seawater seeps up into the snow and that allows the snow to clump on the bear foot and cause ice .,science
i feel theyve been doing that for a while .,science
i feel the third one is probably the least likely hypothesis .,science
but what do we know ?,science
ive never studied a polar bear up close and i hope never to .,science
i will not be doing that myself either .,science
this is this week in science .,science
thank you everyone for joining u . we are here .,science
if you are enjoying the show if you are enjoying the show .,science
yeah if you are joining the show i am enjoying it .,science
yeah i put the word together .,science
please share the show with a friend .,science
please share with someone now if you are enjoying it now .,science
and if you enjoy the show head on over to twist.org and click on that patreon link .,science
itll send you over to our community site for support and you can become a supporting member and at any amount ten and more a month .,science
and we will thank you by name at the end of the show .,science
are we ready to come on back for more this week in science ?,science
everyone i would love to take this opportunity to bring our guest for the evening dr. steven rouse .,science
he pulling him steven but we are calling steve .,science
either way is great .,science
dr. rouse is professor of psychology at pepperdines siever college with diverse research interest from religiosity to personality test to open science and most recently what people are willing to drink .,science
thank you for joining u this evening .,science
thank you much for letting me come .,science
i am excited to talk about a project that ha been one of the most eyeopening and enlightening and exciting project ive had a chance to take part in in recent year .,science
yeah i am excited about it .,science
i wa interested in the idea behind the study because there are many thing we are coming up against these day .,science
socially with what are people going to accept a thing change in our world ?,science
and how do we talk to people about thing ?,science
and i think stuff drinking water is incredibly important .,science
i thought this wa fascinating .,science
and before you jump into the study though can you start with basic overview of your diverse interest and how did you go from this diversity of thing that you study into this one particular question ?,science
yeah ive joked that i am not joked .,science
ive ive come to the realization that i have a short attention span .,science
and i love being at a place pepperdine where i am not necessarily expected to stay on the same research agenda year after year after year where i have a little bit more freedom to be able to pursue one topic .,science
and then if i get to the end of that topic i go that look an interesting thing over there .,science
and then i get to wander after something else and then and i enjoy getting a chance to explore where my interest are and also to explore where my student interest are .,science
it is been fun in recent year to be talking with student in class .,science
and if a question come up it is exciting to be in a discipline where we can not we do not go i wonder but we say let find out .,science
let let gather data find out about that .,science
my research background wanders all over the place .,science
i think thats but it is it is interest your your your overall interest is human psychology and thats .,science
what make u tick .,science
i got a quick question because you mentioned the personality test .,science
what doe it say about me or somebody let say i have a friend .,science
thats too late .,science
what doe it say about a person when they are terrified of taking a personality test ?,science
what it say is that weve elevated the importance of personality test up above where they should be .,science
i know i study personality test .,science
thats one of my primary interest but i think a lot of time weve acted a though personality test can tell deep dark secret about a person that no one else will know .,science
the friend no this friend apparently worked at a major retailer. . year and year ago .,science
i think they are still in business but but part of getting into the management program wa a fifty question personality test that had it is four category of answer all the way through the thing .,science
and at some point i am being made to make moral choice .,science
do i do the empathetic answer ?,science
or do i do the reasoned answer ?,science
and there an imaginative answer thats the creative one but maybe they do not want that .,science
and then then you are overthinking it but then you are also making these deep philosophical choice within yourself .,science
am i empathetic ?,science
or am i purely a logical creature ?,science
and you have to keep it wa it wa very demanding .,science
for people who think about how they think and how they think about answering question on test it becomes a very meta .,science
it wasnt it wasnt that seems the answer .,science
each one i wa this is a deep moral ethical this crossroad fork in the road that ive come across that i now must pick a path for my future mental state .,science
and then and then they have the disclaimer but this questionnaire is not going to be used to tell whether or not you should work here .,science
this one wa very definitely this determines your future in this how it wa presented .,science
but it wa it wa i said it wa fifty question but there were only four category of question that they asked in over and over again in multiple different way weighing them against the other component in that in that survey .,science
i am always i am always every time i i now do not take them ever since but i am always terrified .,science
it is i remember i have this trauma of all the choice .,science
yeah yeah i get that .,science
i think i am indoor outdoor abcdefg .,science
thats my sorry i am making fun of various test now .,science
yeah. . steve you were going to tell u about your about your various interest that you are working on currently or you have worked on ?,science
yeah it is it is covered anything that anything that i or my student in my class find interesting .,science
and the class that i teach include personality psychological testing human sexuality .,science
and in those class we come up with some fascinating i wonder topic and then get to go off and explore them .,science
this study though wa an entirely different project where it came to me .,science
and i wa grateful that it did because the local water district had some question that they wanted to ask .,science
and they connected up with me to see if i would be willing to independently collect data independently run some analysis and answer some important question for them .,science
i wa grateful to them because this wa an interesting topic that i did not know i wa interested in until i became interested in it until i became invited .,science
i and my colleague became invited to work on this project .,science
got a chance to work two psychologist two ecologist working together along with one person who worked at the water district itself to be able to answer some question about how to help people become more accepting of purified recycled water .,science
here some that doesnt sound hard .,science
but when you state that then it is what do you think about purified recycled water ?,science
we have many people have purifier .,science
we have what could be wrong with that ?,science
why did that mean a messaging check ?,science
we have tap purifier .,science
people are familiar with purified water .,science
but what is the recycled aspect ?,science
thats what i would think .,science
is there more than that though ?,science
is it waste wastewater system not gray water but the full wastewater recycling ?,science
i am coming to you from southern california .,science
i am on the pepperdine campus in malibu .,science
where there fire it is constant fire .,science
and thats very relevant to this that we go through period of drought .,science
but let me back up a little bit .,science
if i were to go now and pour some water down the drain that water would be a process to make it safe to be put back into the environment to be poured out into the stream and river .,science
and that would eventually get to the ocean .,science
but thats a lot of water that is being lost .,science
thats a lot of water that is being wasted .,science
because here in southern california in the la area weve got a major city in an area that doe not have access to a very large amount of groundwater .,science
about a third my understanding is now keep in mind i am a psychologist .,science
i am not a water scientist .,science
ive become very educated about this but coming to you from the perspective of a psychologist but apparently about a third of the water that is used in southern california come from local groundwater .,science
the majority of it either come to u from northern california or it come from the east through the colorado river .,science
and a lot of the water that we are drinking here in southern california is flowing past community and farm that would love to have access to that water .,science
and we are a a city that is continuing to grow thats not sustainable to have u use the water once and then dump it into the ocean .,science
and the local water district is beginning a process by which they are going to begin using purified recycled water a part of the water source for tap water .,science
the way this system is going to work is that a the water get processed once to the level that it could be released back into the environment released back into the river and stream it is then going to go through a threestage process .,science
there an ultrafiltration process there a reverse osmosis process and then there an ultraviolet oxidation process .,science
the water becomes completely pure .,science
and in fact ive got some of the water with me now a colleague at the water district who are willing to give me some of the water .,science
this water is the purest water ive ever drunk .,science
it is amazing to drink something of the comparison .,science
i remember when i wa young one time went to the carlsbad cavern and if youve gone to a big cave you may have had similar experience where they turned the light off and there no light at all and you experience for the first time true darkness .,science
drinking this water is almost the gustatory equivalent of the visual experience of having no light .,science
it is bizarre to drink something that ha absolutely no taste because then you realize ive been tasting thing in the water that ive been drinking until now .,science
and in fact this water is pure that if you drink nothing but it it is pure it would begin leaching calcium out of your bone because it is that pure .,science
i wa going to say it need to have the mineral in there .,science
exactly exactly .,science
once it go through this three stage process becomes incredibly pure it then get released into the local reservoir .,science
and my understanding is that once it get released an individual water droplet would take roughly two to four month to go from where it get released to the place where then it get pulled back out again .,science
and it ha a chance to mix with the water that doe come down from northern california in this natural reservoir or in this in this reservoir then it is treated again to epa standard and it is drinkable consumable .,science
the technology work the technology this technology is not new .,science
this is technology that work and ha been around for a long time .,science
if you think about it the space station ha been using recycled water for decade there not spring of pure water up in space .,science
and there lot of other community that have been using this technology but people have a knee jerk reaction when they hear about this wa water that at one time had been waste .,science
and the la virginas water district decided they wanted to invest time money and effort into getting the community comfortable with the idea of this before it went live .,science
and they contacted me to evaluate the effectiveness of some of their educational program .,science
thats a drawn out origin story for the for the study .,science
doe that all make sense far ?,science
yeah absolutely .,science
and being from northern california and having lived in southern california i can tell you one northern california it is not straight from the sierra down to southern california .,science
there all kind of farmland and everything else that you are going to experience .,science
and it is not sent in underground piping it is sent in these big above ground trench .,science
that water is already getting exposed to all sort of human influenced environment on the way down which i think that i think the part that wa fat and from being in southern california i did not even know people drank tap water .,science
i never saw that .,science
but but the next question but yeah that part that you mentioned about reintroducing it to the reservoir a the method of not only gaining the mixing with and gaining the mineral content but then going through the normal process of purification that would take from the water .,science
thats the the wa the missing link in my head about how do they get from yes you can do this you can purify the water but then how do you get it back up to a drinking standard ?,science
and that make total sense now that you would you would reintroduce it to the natural environment where you are pulling it from in the somewhat natural in the reservoir a the mix a the premix .,science
and thats thats brilliant .,science
it is .,science
but thinking about the people who are drinking the water .,science
justin said who drink tap water in southern california ?,science
they are bottled water or they are whatever .,science
did you have any did you ask people a they came in what where they got their water what their thought about their water were ahead of time ?,science
do they think about where their water come from ?,science
did you ask these kind of question a you came into the study ?,science
not those kind of question .,science
those would be good question to ask about because yeah a lot of time we do not think about where the water come from .,science
i grew up in even though i am in southern california now i grew up in denver .,science
and i used to always think about that i am drinking this pure mountain water .,science
earlier justin you said at the top of the show you talked about how all water is reused water .,science
and thats absolutely true .,science
not even talking about all the water that then get evaporated and rained down again even the water that come in a stream go past different community is reused is used and then passed on to someone else .,science
we are in an area where the last any water that get down the drain doesnt have any other community further downstream .,science
and thats such a waste for that water to be lost .,science
and how much water is going to keep coming there you have to plan for the future ?,science
because we are in a drought prone area .,science
and the los virginas water district invested money to get and got some great grant to be able to create a demonstration center .,science
and this is a mini version of the whole water treatment plant that is eventually going to go online .,science
and this treatment plant or this demonstration center is available for people from the community to be able to come and visit and to be able to walk through the process of seeing this three stage purification process .,science
and then at the end of the at the end of the process they get a glass of water and can try some of the purified recycled water .,science
and there a powerful experience of being able to drink it and realize how pure and how perfect it taste .,science
what we were doing is that we would test people in their attitude about purified recycled water .,science
and we conducted two study the team conducted two study .,science
the first study wa a standard prepost study .,science
we had a group of participant come to the water demonstration center took a test to measure their attitude about purified recycled water and the attitude were pretty diverse .,science
but then they went through the demonstration center and then at the end they were asked to take that same test again and to give it a chance to drink some water .,science
and if i do not move around enough my light go out .,science
you may see me every now and then having to do that .,science
at the end of the tour though their attitude were substantially higher than they were at the beginning .,science
in fact every single person wa willing to drink water at the end of the tour .,science
and we were able to see twice that this demonstration center work .,science
there a powerful experience in being able to see it for oneself and be able to realize now this is good .,science
this work .,science
the people that were there though did them a they were doing the study and see they are hearing about wait is there a cycle ?,science
and did they have funny face ?,science
the test face ?,science
or wa there and wa there a change with that education ?,science
even when i even when i tell my student about this every now and then when i talk about the whole nature of the project i see student give that disgust expression .,science
and we did have a component to this study that we wish that it had worked but we did not frankly ill be honest i did not think through one element of it before the study went live .,science
we had had some software that can measure subtle facial muscle movement especially those facial muscle movement related to different emotional experience .,science
and the idea wa that we might be able to see whether a person facial expression might show more indication of disgust if they hadnt gone through the tour than if they had gone to through the tour .,science
i said though we i did not think through one element of it enough and we did not do enough pilot testing because a people are raising a glass to their mouth to sample it walking part of the face that show the disgust .,science
but we even in the randomized experiment people drank the water and people were in fact in both group people were willing to drink the water .,science
and it wa exciting to see how much the attitude had changed .,science
something that you alluded to before weve been talking about when being in high school in denver in high school i wa i lived i grew up in a town that had water .,science
back then it wa exclusively watered .,science
it tasted terrible because it had high mineral content beyond .,science
but my concept of wastewater treatment plant wa that they treated the water and then released it back into the water ecosystem .,science
in la it make sense especially malibu .,science
i remember not being able to swim in malibu or down to santa cruz because there wa a wastewater plant that had ruptured and there wa sewage getting sent out and it will pipe into the ocean thats normally sending out the purified water .,science
what happens in linn with all of the wastewater treatment plant ?,science
because those are already treating the water thats been used for sewage and everything else wa sewage at one point or tap water going down the drain what have you .,science
where doe that where doe all that water go ?,science
thats a good question .,science
remember you have a psychologist here not the water scientist .,science
if you are two hundred mile inland it is not there a pipe running all the way to the ocean to get rid of everything .,science
there are a lot of river and tributary there are lot of place .,science
but these are the river that then are being used a drinking water downstream from it .,science
are not we already doing this ?,science
because again in high school i assumed thats what a wastewater treatment plant wa wa cleaning the water that we would put it back into the system .,science
yeah to be honest i do not know .,science
i know that here it is released into the stream .,science
i have no idea. . and i do know thats how it is in colorado too .,science
my dad is a hydrogeologist and he and i had a chance to to be honest sometimes he and i do not have a lot to talk about .,science
this wa a great project .,science
i wa able to connect it in an unexpected way .,science
i know that in colorado that is a big part of it that it is released also into the river after it is processed .,science
but yeah i do not know .,science
i spend a little bit of time living in west texas .,science
and i know exactly what you are talking about about the water .,science
and it is where you can see thing see lime floating in it .,science
my goodness .,science
or the the faucet every faucet had this .,science
the overflow is into the willamette river .,science
the willamette river go into the columbia river and that people fish there all sort of stuff .,science
and there for a very long time ha been a lot of disgust about swimming in the willamette river .,science
you do not you do not catch fish .,science
and it is a big been a big project to clean up the river .,science
and the big pipe project ha more capacity make sure that it doesnt overflow .,science
and they are taking that wastewater and then dealing with it and treating it .,science
and then yeah it is a whole new situation .,science
but there the disgust in the environment the environment that you are in and the water and where it go .,science
everyone know the quote unquote la river which theyve been working on making better .,science
but then there the water you drink .,science
and we and i am wondering if this part is part of the acceptance or the advertising campaign that have been used to sell people water .,science
it is from nice place the bottled water the thing that you buy ?,science
and your people think the bottled water that they are buying is cleaner and better for them than the water that come out of their tap .,science
and it is le regulated .,science
and it is le you are .,science
the it is a huge deal .,science
do you have any do you have any further question about this psychology of the acceptance of you the water we are drinking and what what people seem to be willing to accept or not ?,science
and why ?,science
there i want to give a shout out to someone whose research i admire .,science
ive never met him but paul rosen is at university of pennsylvania .,science
and he done some amazing research on on human disgust and the disgust reaction .,science
and discus human disgust is fascinating that it it probably wa beneficial to our specie back helping our specie survive the pleistocene era to to be a specie to recognize maybe we shouldnt use the bathroom close to our food source and water source .,science
we that wa probably helpful for u to have the ability to to be disgusted .,science
but evolution reward survival more than reward rightness .,science
and sometimes some of the product of evolution may not be logical .,science
and we may have some disgust reaction even when thats not rational or realistic .,science
and i know that rosen and his colleague did one study that i found fascinating where he went through several different stage of asking people whether or not theyd be willing to drink .,science
for instance one part sewage mixed with a thousand part pure water .,science
and most people can not that but then what about what about if it is purified and go through a pipe to your faucet ?,science
the pipe is not enough to purify it .,science
but if it go one hundred mile down the fast flowing river yeah sure .,science
or if it get mixed in with a lake yeah sure i guess that that would be fine .,science
and through this series of question wa able to see what are the process by which disgust can be overcome ?,science
because disgust we there a concept called contamination permanence that once we think of something a contaminated it doesnt become non contaminated .,science
unless there something powerful to overplay it .,science
this is a study that i always feel i have to take a big dose of of suspension of disbelief about it .,science
but if there in one study people were asked to think about what if you have this sweater and this you find out that this sweater had once been owned by adolf hitler would you wear it ?,science
people say no i would not .,science
but what if you find out that this first one yeah it is the almost the evilness contaminating the sweater .,science
but what if then after it wa owned by hitler mother teresa wore it and people thats even worse .,science
yeah no absolutely not .,science
big suspension of disbelief on that about what wa the a homicidal dictator and the world worst con artist combined .,science
but anyway how we talk about it .,science
people generally are more accepting of it in that condition .,science
and thats thats technically that wa mother teresa role .,science
her biggest her biggest donor were dictator and despot who needed to clean their image .,science
and thats thats where she received huge donation to go meet with pinuche or whoever the dictator of the day wa or whoever needed cleaning up of their image after an ethnic cleansing event or a suppression of democracy .,science
mother teresa would show up and be hey look we are friend .,science
you should tell this story .,science
and then we should repeat the study .,science
and then well see how the result of the study change .,science
doe it know the holy affine effect that it did before ?,science
yeah this is this is fast .,science
there also there an element there a story i am going to talk about later on the show about doula .,science
this spoiler the cessarian delivery were forty seven lower for medicaid patient who were assigned doula .,science
now the doula are not medical practitioner .,science
what they are providing is information .,science
they are answering question .,science
they are doing some patient advocacy but they are they are explainers .,science
and helpful hint bring this go bag with you but also translating what the doctor is saying when it is not immediately understood .,science
and i am seeing the correlation here where once people had the basic education of what to expect and what concern were not going to be relevant with this that it changed their attitude .,science
and it change the outcome then of people accepting these thing .,science
but what what amazes me is that there some thing that are harder to get over than other thing .,science
for instance the idea of purified recycled water still cause a knee jerk reaction for some people whereas we have entire community that still are drinking water that flow through lead based pipe .,science
and here we have contaminant that have been empirically shown to increase increase the likelihood of adhd to decrease iq and decrease cognitive reasoning ability .,science
and that doe not cause the knee jerk reaction that purified recycled water doe .,science
i am grateful that a few week ago epa developed a new rule .,science
and i think there wa a i can not i should have looked this up at a time i can not remember whether it is two.six million i do not remember what where the how many zero there are .,science
but i think it is two.six billion dollar to for some major community to be able to finally once and for all get rid of the lead based pipe because that is empirically demonstrated to be detrimental to entire community .,science
and yet we do not have the discussed knee jerk reaction about that .,science
i think that is a huge point .,science
it is that our negativity bias ?,science
is it what we have been already primed to feel more negatively about ?,science
is it distance ?,science
it is somebody else having lead pipe versus u drinking the purified water .,science
this is opinion .,science
i feel it is a body thing a opposed to a mineral thing .,science
lead doesnt seem a icky a body related process .,science
thats thats terrible .,science
i do remember this is i lived in an older part of hollywood for for some of my la time .,science
and i do remember you turn on the faucet and youd have to let it run until it stopped being brown .,science
who the piping in the building or maybe in the neighborhood ?,science
it is the proper flaking .,science
a punch it a punch .,science
i wa gon na get a lot of it is normal .,science
a normal first step .,science
you were but the and even in even in the olden day of growing up in the town with the water that you would think is separate from all because this is where it came from .,science
it is yeah our water taste bad but it come from a . it is pure .,science
it is not that wastewater treated stuff that everybody else is drinking .,science
we got the better water even though it taste terrible .,science
and then of course year later they did testing and found all kind of benzine and thing that that are not supposed to be drunk that were above the level that you would want to be given fertilizer .,science
all sort of thing that work it way into .,science
yeah farm water is by the way farm water is amazing .,science
thats making it glow in the dark .,science
i probably do have never checked .,science
and even if you go if you were to go now to a a camping supply store or a hiking supply store and you get a water filter those water filter are not regulated .,science
there we get safer water out of the tap .,science
and yet there some suspicion about that .,science
my question for the future for education i think and the messaging is not everybodys going to be able to make it to these education center .,science
not every treatment facility will have the funding to have these kind of walkthroughs and educational outreach initiative .,science
how do we message moving into the future when we would love people to have water that we are creating sustainably that we are trying to develop new way of living in area where maybe there not enough whatever it is .,science
but how do you go against the marketing messaging that ha billion of dollar from the big corporation versus it come out of your tap and it is been tested and it is clean .,science
did you have any other interesting insight from your study or other question that you are interested in looking into with your student ?,science
weve i said i focus on the topic for a while and then i go into a different topic .,science
and i have loved this project and we may do a little bit of additional followup to it .,science
but gotten to a point where now i found some other topic in some other area completely unrelated .,science
maybe in a couple of year i can come back and talk about something else too .,science
in a different range .,science
would you recommend that we refer to the recycled water purified recycled water a toilet water ?,science
i would think that that would be a very very inaccurate way to describe it .,science
and in fact often it is referred to a toilet to tap and that phrase is wrong because it is toilet to first processing to ultra filtration to et cetera et cetera et cetera to finally .,science
and they are trying to be transparent in the name but at the same time it might also be undermining what they are trying to achieve .,science
in some community that phrase toilet to tap ha not been used by the people who are behind the process but instead people who are trying to shoot that process down .,science
and that because they are that phrase doe bring back the yuck factor .,science
and thats a phrase that my understanding is the community where there been some controversy about implementing this that phrase wa used in a almost antagonistic way to lower attitude about it .,science
yeah there wa a comment in our chat here saying that in san diego they used the word the phrase toilet water and they were able to stop an initiative using recycled water in this man .,science
speaking from somebody who grew up in farland they do not grow your produce in honey .,science
all of this is connected .,science
yeah ive been using the phrase toilet this evening and it is knowingly sensationalistic and i assume the intelligence of my listener in this conversation to know i use it in humor and not in seriousness .,science
now it is time for you to leave your arm .,science
all of your is grown in poop .,science
thats how we do it .,science
thats what work .,science
thats what make it grow .,science
yeah get educated get over it .,science
i want that tshirt get educated .,science
don hogan in the chat room is everything ever see what end up in a hot water heater is that bad to drink ?,science
yes it is not ever recommended to drink your hot water because your hot water heater typically most hot water system do gain a lot of contaminant and roll buildup over year .,science
and did you ever know there could be extremophiles in there ?,science
you do not know .,science
but you are supposed to drink it if the water supply ha been shut down due to a major earthquake or some other catastrophe then it can be a source .,science
then go ahead .,science
it is worth it .,science
but yeah it is typically you are not supposed to drink that .,science
do not use hot water and then boil water to preheat it or anything that .,science
only drink the cold water because it is not gone through that extra potentially contaminated stuff .,science
steve do you have anything else you want to add about this study or any other work that you are currently interested in that you want to comment on ?,science
that broad openended question is a paralyzing question to me .,science
i do that to people .,science
yeah but i have moved on to especially currently working on some question that some student and i were curious about during my human sexuality class .,science
and yeah in a couple year maybe i can come back and tell you about some cool thing weve been finding out there .,science
what wa the question ?,science
whats the question at least ?,science
and at the same time the majority of people again more than fifty at least have some objection to pornography .,science
if you think about that venn diagram there are a lot of people who are engaging in a behavior that is causing them distress because of some incompatibility with their value with their value system .,science
and we are beginning the process of looking at what are the kind of opposition that people have about pornography .,science
and we are starting to look at is a person opposition due to exploitation of people or is a person opposition due to any religious belief or is a person opposition due to unrealistic expectation that they may have .,science
there multiple reason why a person may have some opposition .,science
and if a person wanting to address a value discrepant behavior maybe instead of treating everyone in a cookie cutter way a though everyone ha the same basis of their opposition maybe we need to start looking into where the opposition is for each individual person .,science
if they are engaging in something that they want to reduce how can we help them reduce that behavior ?,science
no thats thats we are reduce the meaning here if it is disturbing or in conflict ?,science
yeah if where is the discrepancy coming from and what is the cognitive distance that a person going through and how do we understand that ?,science
because i think that that approach might be better than the ineffectual approach that is often used in the porn addiction industry .,science
when from study about hiding autism masking autism symptom to study about water purification to porn i all over the place .,science
but thats what i love about my job .,science
thats cool .,science
yeah thats why i love working at a place this where i can do that .,science
i wa wait you can do that in science ?,science
i thought you had to be super focused .,science
hold on .,science
all we have a few more story to go .,science
do you want to hang out and talk about them or you can add ?,science
id love to if you do not mind some blank slate question of complete ignorance going into the topic .,science
thats how i approach everything in life .,science
thank you much for joining u dr. rouse .,science
this is this week in science .,science
if you are loving the show even if you are not i do not know head over to twist.org click on our zazzle link .,science
you can find our merchandise there hat pen they do not know if we have pen .,science
maybe you can find a pen twist .,science
we have mouse pad and hat and all sort of thing .,science
i do not know why i said pen .,science
now we have to make them .,science
now i have to make a pen .,science
but if you would to help support the show zazzle is a great way to find bit of twist that you can carry around with you throughout your day .,science
all come on back justin .,science
thats a good pen .,science
it is a great pen .,science
it is your turn justin .,science
let talk about the doula .,science
this is a ... all i want to talk about doula .,science
yeah this research wa following up .,science
doula are not what do you call it medical advisor .,science
they are not yeah they do not do medical care .,science
doula are something that ... irregenced one have experience with stuff but yeah they havent been trained in medicine .,science
not necessarily but they are not a midwife which is going to be a degree and they are going to be involved in delivering the child and giving you medical advice and doing the evaluation along the way .,science
a doula is somebody who there to inform to educate and to advise mother who are expecting .,science
and saying our patient ha requested this and only want that option a a last resort if it is an emergency situation .,science
there advocacy there education they will do the not the ultrasound but the one where you are listening for the heartbeat a thing .,science
this is the study wa intriguing to me because when my we were assigned a doula in my small farming town back in two thousand and two two thousand and three when my first child wa born .,science
this thing it wa sounding me that this ha only become something that wa included with medicaid in two thousand and twenty .,science
and they found that with the doula cesarean delivery were forty seven le likely .,science
we have thing to do we got to schedule it chop chop .,science
it is efficient for the doctor but it can have ramification on future delivery a a potential .,science
it is in a which wa another element that they found that this wa also by preventing cesarean that you could be creating future fertility functionality .,science
or how not why but how .,science
how and why .,science
there is very often there is a for many woman they have no idea what they are doing whats going on .,science
and it is not it is being lost inside of being lost .,science
and i wonder doe the doula relationship last beyond the birth ?,science
is the doula still there after ?,science
is the doula only there a that transition that person that is between the hospital and the mother the family ?,science
what is the relationship thats involved here ?,science
wa there a difference at any point with any part of the population they were looking at ?,science
yeah there wa a slight let me go find it here but i got it .,science
there wa yeah in county with high infant mortality rate caesarean delivery dropped by fifty seven with the woman with doula support .,science
it wa another eleven higher ten higher in those underserved community .,science
the effect wa bigger there ?,science
there wa a lack of significant fighting regarding emergency department visit inpatient admission postpartum depression or anxiety .,science
these were not affected meaning yeah the doula did not solve all the problem but it did not contribute to them either ?,science
it wa it did not it did not have any negative and had all these positive associated with it .,science
and this in this study you can look at there have been previous study that indicated that this should be the trend and is the trend elsewhere .,science
but this one wa post expansion in medicaid .,science
and then you can look at it this is the followup how did our expansion work ?,science
what is the result ?,science
and what it show is extremely positive .,science
therefore it would be very likely that this will get expanded further .,science
i do not know it doesnt explain whether the doula are doing the followup or if it is at the hospital .,science
i do not know if it wa normal .,science
normal channel if there extra communication after the fact .,science
then maybe they thats why they werent going .,science
but it could be that they have to go there versus maybe the doula wa visiting at home .,science
those are also maybe there a convenience factor involved but it doesnt it did not pull those detail out of the study .,science
i am speculating there which way it might have played out .,science
i am wondering also go ahead steve .,science
thats exciting especially to find out about the extra information that getting information begets the desire to get more information and getting learning make you realize the value and continue to seek out learning .,science
but i think it is the doula here is human ?,science
this is a person who interacting with you personally who hows it going ?,science
have you made this appointment ?,science
and this is your next step .,science
and this is what you should expect and leading you through the process ?,science
and justin said also an advocate for you .,science
you sit and you watch an asynchronous tour of the hospital and asynchronous lecture or explanation of stuff thats going on .,science
and that is that is the tour are nice .,science
the tour are nice because there some people meeting in the space and seeing people and walking through ?,science
going to be an emergency mode when the day comes. . you are going to be in urgent freak out mode trying to keep cool because you are not the one giving birth .,science
it is rainbow and marshmallow .,science
but knowing we park here we walk here take a left and then it is going to be down the hall and to the or knowing exactly where your footstep will be on that day is exceedingly important .,science
can definitely think about my own personal experience of the ignorance brings about all these panic thought about what could possibly go wrong .,science
and we were able to go through a tour and we are able to see yeah we can do this and even seeing people in the process and think they are doing it we can do it .,science
this is good .,science
that that is a shame .,science
thats too bad .,science
and it but it make me wonder .,science
yeah but it make me wonder it is interesting to see how the expansion of this within medicaid ha been beneficial beneficial .,science
but at the same time it is a question how it is the real impact it is going to have .,science
one of the one of the thing that i think influence why doula are important is what you are saying .,science
they are paid a tremendously lower salary than your phd obgyn meaning that they will be able to spend a lot more time with the patient than they may spend with the obgyn. . and the patient can not call up the obgyn all the time .,science
you call and they are excuse me i be on hold or we are gon na find well find somebody else to answer your question or yeah .,science
there is an economic driver that should be recognized in this that you will get a lot more education in this doula system than you ever will and getting those quick meeting where they are gon na check this check that check this out the door a scenario .,science
with the human touch education with the human touch .,science
want to move to your next one ?,science
what wa the next one ?,science
where did i got to say that ?,science
is if i pulled up a whole bunch of other extra in case this one this one is real quick .,science
what wa i going to do ?,science
i wrote it down .,science
yeah i can this is the global warming silver lining .,science
i do not know how much .,science
here it is .,science
because one of the thing weve all been most concerned about when it come to global warming is how will it affect coffee production ?,science
thats the leading thing on everybodys mind .,science
this is the biggest concern .,science
and i think the concern is is is maybe underrated .,science
especially for you a a host of this week in science in denmark at 5am .,science
this is real quick .,science
this is a a a a plus study .,science
it say under climate change scenario thirty to forty four of thirty to thirty sorry thirty to forty four more land in ethiopia may become suitable for growing arabica coffee by two thousand and eighty .,science
now ethiopia is i think the only i think thats where coffee wa maybe the only other coffee i do not know .,science
but this is this is one of the major producer of coffee worldwide .,science
it is more than a quarter of ethiopia income .,science
currently it is the largest growing industry of coffee anywhere in term of more and more land .,science
but then know that they are going to get up to forty four more land that will be suitable for growing coffee under global warming condition under two different model that were the scenario that were run .,science
is at least some good news .,science
these there are these question ?,science
how is the water going to be redistributed a climate change ?,science
we can not make prediction of we are starting to make very specific prediction .,science
apparently new mexico santa fe new mexico area is or arizona is going to have more water .,science
i do not know but i do not know whether that mean more flood or whether that mean more nice running river in an area that is now very dry .,science
itll likely be both .,science
this is not aerial river .,science
what is it called ?,science
atmospheric river .,science
we are supposed to have one of those this weekend in portland .,science
well move from portland maybe down into central california or place east and dump tremendous amount of water sometimes and then nothing for a few year after .,science
and it mean it is more stochastic unreliable at least unreliable in the sense that it is not the pattern that we are accustomed to in a hundred year of last hundred year of american climate .,science
which is already a very subjective starting point deciding that this is how thing always will be .,science
the question here with ethiopia though is south america are you going to have whats going to happen to your environmental condition for coffee and chocolate and thing and should you move your arm to ethiopia ?,science
what it is also showing is that thing will move .,science
a there forty four more land available in ethiopia there might be twenty le somewhere else .,science
or in south america this is again this is misremembering the information is that it wasnt much i think that the coffee growing overall area were going to be reduced or increased but that they would be moving .,science
and then you have a scenario of it is if central california they are central california is no longer good at growing tomato .,science
we have to move all of that to nevada .,science
thats not a thing that you do overnight .,science
that is a tremendous shift of industry of infrastructure .,science
even when we were talking about how much area will be affected sometimes we are not describing that those area will not be in the same place .,science
because this article is specific to ethiopia .,science
and yeah thats the question that came to my mind first of what about other place ?,science
is this gain at the loss elsewhere ?,science
and what is the balance of loss and gain ?,science
and i think thats important for u to look not at individual country but to look more systemically at the entire the world ecosystem .,science
yeah that is the point .,science
did you have more to say about the coffee justin ?,science
did you have a quick blurb at the end of their show there ?,science
because yeah it wa good i usually bring terrible news when it come to global warming .,science
i look for the good news .,science
i am this look a good story .,science
ill bring this one .,science
and then by the end of it it slip .,science
and i wa wait i thought this wa a good story .,science
you knew the whole time .,science
all let me move on to my last couple of story a we finish up the show here .,science
social medium some of u spend more and more time on different social medium .,science
now that it is become more and more fragmented some of u are still on x others have moved to thread .,science
there the mastodon federated server blue sky i am on there .,science
there a butterfly .,science
i followed the butterfly .,science
there many different social medium platform .,science
and researcher published in iscience it is openly accessible to anyone .,science
their study of the x former twitter platform but it wasnt because they couldnt get the data anymore because the api ha been shut down to researcher since it wa purchased and is under new ownership .,science
the researcher simulated a social medium platform that might be x which is formerly twitter in their research .,science
this is a simulation of something that might happen in the real world .,science
and the whole thing is is this very relevant or verifiable ?,science
anyway the question is since x and other platform have verified user verification on some platform is simply show u who you are and well say that you are a real person .,science
and then it doesnt mean anything it mean that you are then verified a a human being and a who you say you are .,science
the new x platform is using verification a a pay for play .,science
if you pay for a subscription fee you are verified .,science
and the algorithm ha been suggested to prioritize those paid verified user over others .,science
and the question is do these verified user then have an outsized influence on whats going on and what people are thinking on the website on the platform ?,science
the researcher were we can not get the data let simulate it .,science
and they put together their computer simulation where they used verified individual verified individual with very extreme biased position that were very firm and unflexible .,science
and then individual who were verified who were more likely to shift their view and listen to other people have conversation with people .,science
and what they determined is that verified user using what the assumed model for the algorithm in the x platform is that verified user yes indeed do influence the view and the idea that take hold on the social medium platform .,science
and those user become more influential when they are le likely to talk to people .,science
and people are more likely to start to accept what those people say a opposed to have conversation and share information .,science
the theory is that when you have verified individual who can reach more people and can significantly impact idea formation that that can reinforce echo chamber which can have then ripple effect into not that medium platform but also into other medium outlet and also society in general .,science
the question is what do you do about this moving forward ?,science
and we do not know what to do but they plan to increase the realism of their model .,science
they want to add new speed and reposting and they are going to incorporate data from other platform that have more open apis blue sky .,science
the concern is that you have medium mogul or biased individual with money who are paying for account maybe even paid bot account and pushing information in very biased way that can have very negative influence .,science
but maybe i am a good person and i have lot of money and i have a good bot network .,science
what do we think about this ?,science
are we still doing social medium everyone ?,science
i stopped a long time ago and it wa there wa a point in the early day of the twitter where the only people on twitter were interested in engaged in the subject that they were discussing .,science
and at some point the troll factory broke in and started smashing conversation everywhere possible .,science
and i love the idea of open democratic conversation .,science
but i think there should be an internal ethic of i have something to contribute to this in a constructive way before an individual engages in the open form of discussion .,science
and i do not see that anywhere in there .,science
what i see instead is a horrible banter and it is not worth my time because i am not getting anything out of it and i am not communicating anything of value or learning anything of value from a lot of the conversation that go on .,science
for that reason i stopped even looking at the social medium .,science
but it ha been it is still a place where a lot of people spend their time and influence a lot of our society at this instant .,science
and thats what i am speaking specifically about the twitter .,science
there other one that i will i still do not do posting or ... show your baby picture i know .,science
theyve got a new kid .,science
this is a costbenefit analysis ?,science
what is it for you a an individual ?,science
and i think each of u is doing that .,science
but i do not know i worry about our kid .,science
i worry about our society in general .,science
if i missed it in the description of the study please forgive me .,science
but did they communicate to the participant what the verification represented ?,science
because you are is the verification ive paid money and therefore i am allowed to have this this designation or is it some recognition of being a real person in this particular study ?,science
did they educate that ?,science
because i do feel thats part of internet and social medium literacy for people to be able to find out what exactly doe this verification mean that it doesnt necessarily mean you are an expert on a topic .,science
it mean you paid money or it mean you are real .,science
did they at all communicate to the participant what that verification represented ?,science
no this wa yeah they had these very fake verification .,science
it is the real world .,science
yeah and they were looking to see how different number of the verified user impacted the formation of idea or of little echo chamber within the total .,science
yeah that wa part of it .,science
this is an extension of a philosophy that ha been my gosh now i forgot what the decision wa by the supreme court .,science
but that there a philosophy that ha been endorsed by the supreme court which ha allowed dark money to flow into politics which state that money is free speech .,science
and by incorporating that into a public forum type look something that appears a public forum but is not having people who pay into that system get more weighted speech is absolutely in keeping with that philosophy .,science
to me it is unsurprising that the algorithm are preferencing people who pay coming from a company .,science
thank you david .,science
thank you much .,science
and thats why that and when always escape me is because it is such double speak .,science
but when we come down to it such double speak terminology citizen united for corporation over citizen speech is what they should have called it .,science
but of course they called it citizen united .,science
it sounded friendly .,science
that you want to talk about toilet water .,science
thats what toilet water is .,science
thats toilet water .,science
there we go .,science
yeah but i think that the point that steve got out is the education aspect .,science
and i think a lot of people do not understand how the platform work that they are using they do not understand the algorithm that are influencing what they see and different topic they see different user they see .,science
i think i think education on that front would go a long way to help pop these echo chamber bubble .,science
but yeah it is difficult though because the system change frequently .,science
and it is hard to have an education system with a constantly dynamically shifting topic that we need to make people literate about .,science
and how do you how do you enhance literacy when youve got an ever shifting topic ever shifting goalpost ?,science
thats hard .,science
and i think this is a good segue into my into another story here which is you teach people the best negative bias .,science
one lesson this is it we could we could have taught people not to social medium but we did not do that .,science
we did not know the danger .,science
however art of generative artificial ai or large language model .,science
let teach people not to them people already starting out not too keen on them .,science
let keep going this way everyone .,science
new study published using chat gpt and story written using the most recent version of chat gpt .,science
this is published in journal of communication .,science
researcher put two different version of the same story one written by a person and the other by chat gpt .,science
and then participant judged how much they liked the story .,science
however did they flip ?,science
did they flip it on them ?,science
did they trick the people ?,science
no they they said how much do you the story and generally people liked the story written by human better .,science
but the chat gp story were a close second .,science
they werent a far off a you would expect .,science
they did not laugh .,science
they lacked the depth .,science
it wa a if they were written at a more basic level .,science
they lacked some of that the detail and whatever it is that human factor that get into a storytelling .,science
but it wa close .,science
but it wa close .,science
but when they asked the participant to judge the story and they told them this is written by a person or this is written by chat gpt chat gp wa gtp wa terrible .,science
people did not those story at all .,science
they loved the story written by people .,science
they were superior .,science
whats interesting i think about this is did they flip it on the because maybe this is the same study and i misunderstood it because i did not bring it for the show .,science
i did not prior to it .,science
but it sounded it wa the story written by human if the participant were told that they were written by chat gpt that they did not them .,science
they did .,science
it wa their bias decided whether or not they liked it not the material itself .,science
thats exactly it .,science
but that wa why they did that .,science
but because they saw in the first instant experiment that they were very close .,science
they werent that far off .,science
and the question wa if people knew would it be different ?,science
or if they were told i do not know if it wa would it be different ?,science
and i do not know if it wa chat gpt .,science
it is the only one i know the name of .,science
otherwise ive ignored .,science
ive at this point not been forced to learn the name of any other large language model thing that i have to keep in mind .,science
it is branded now .,science
but what i am interested here in is our human bias that are already yeah ill say yes before i get to it .,science
we know that in hiring in the science that or even in ranking for nsf grant that if gender or race are involved there are difference in the way that the application or the proposal are ranked by the people doing the assessing .,science
when you get rid of those identifying factor those difference very often go away .,science
not always but they are more likely to go away .,science
there ha been shown time and again that when we know who we are assessing we are already biased in a particular way .,science
and this is another example of that .,science
but the extremity of it i think is interesting and i wonder if it will hold .,science
and i want where is it coming from now ?,science
and yeah .,science
is it fear ?,science
of course .,science
there an interesting thing that ai is doing with the music industry now .,science
do not go in there .,science
pretty incredible which is it can take the voice of one artist and have them sing the lyric of something else .,science
there some pretty fascinating mashups that now exist .,science
and there a huge outcry that this is ruining the future of music .,science
but this is weve been through this many time .,science
we had what is this synthesized music ?,science
you mean you will not have an artist playing all of the instrument ?,science
that will ruin music .,science
what do you mean it can be recorded and shared ?,science
that will ruin music .,science
what do you mean it will be video killed radio and the synthesizing synthesized digital music killed live performance .,science
all of these thing are going to are happening regardless of how much anybody want to pump the brake on it .,science
i want to hear an artist that i can feel ive developed a relationship with them and their music over many year and enjoy what they create .,science
i want to read story from a person .,science
i want to there are certain aspect to the creation artistic creative creation of thing that i a an individual i think many other people would to continue consuming from people .,science
but thats not to say that these generative and other tool that are artificial intelligence quote unquote which we have said many time before they are not intelligent .,science
but that they are good tool and we can use them a tool .,science
but yeah i do not know .,science
would you how do you think steve how do your student feel about the ai stuff going on ?,science
ive got a colleague who ha done some amazing work trying to educate her student about the limitation of chat gpt .,science
and shes done a project where she ha ha them generate a term paper a very brief term paper using chat gpt and then go into that and look at what is accurate and what is not accurate .,science
and even color code green this is good yellow red no these are not even real source that are being cited .,science
and shes done a great job of being able to show that the student emerge from that experience a lot more skeptical a lot more cautious about even using chat gpt for their own work .,science
upper level student start out more skeptical than the beginning level student do .,science
but the realization of being able to see and evaluate a paper on a topic help a person come to a realization that yeah this is not it may sound good .,science
the language itself may roll and the chat gpt can come up with phrase that communicate but yeah it is not there yet .,science
it is not it is not they are not going to take my podcast yet .,science
i agree the chat gpt can not write .,science
and when you are asking it to generate you are asking it to make it up .,science
there have been lawyer who have cited case that did not exist because they asked for a legal to generate a legal brief with reference to case law .,science
and it did because it is going to do what you ask even though those case law did not exist .,science
yeah it is not going to say i can not do that. . but what it sometimes it doe and then if you needle it itll go yeah i guess i can do that and it continues .,science
but what i found it is good at is analyzing a text that you have offered it .,science
i do this i use this a a i do not know if i am supposed to say this .,science
i use this a a tool sometimes when i am writing up on a scientific research paper .,science
i might have a forty page paper that ha four leg and is in getting deep into method technique and thing that i am maybe not familiar .,science
if i put it in that whole if i put the study into chat gpt i can ask question about the study .,science
what is the cohort size ?,science
what were the what were the implicate where doe it reference how the group were separated ?,science
and i found it to be highly accurate if you give it a specific text to work off of .,science
if you are asking it to go outside of a already set text it ha all kind of yeah gosh know where it is pulling information for .,science
but if you limit it to hallucination they call it hallucin because it interpolates it is a predictor ?,science
it is probably but if you limit it to analyzing a text that you have provided it it is good at breaking down that information .,science
there going to be there going to be us for it that i think people may have not tapped quite yet which is that it is not going to generate a story or tell a tale or give you a legal brief or do your work for you .,science
but it can assist in analysis .,science
and i found it to it will do those thing not ive found it to be highly accurate .,science
also if you ask it to double check it will .,science
and sometimes it is ill go oops .,science
you even even though it is good at analysis you have to find that in the an original study to verify because it can make mistake .,science
it is not perfect .,science
but when you are dealing with a large volume of text it is good at being used a a tool of inquiry .,science
you can ask question about the study and you can tell you whether that wa covered where it wasnt covered or what the closest thing wa and where it reference it .,science
i am going to move u to my nighttime nightmare fuel for u . underwater walking honey badger .,science
mad robotics out of poland ha a fourlegged dog robot that they it normally doesnt go underwater but they they put it underwater and this is the sound of a robot underwater at the bottom of a pool .,science
this is you will not hear draw anymore .,science
this is the sound you should be aware of .,science
they used to say worry about the robot until you can throw them in the pool .,science
now you can not throw them in the pool anymore .,science
i have robot in my ear .,science
ooh i did not hit stop on the youtube screen .,science
sorry it wa yelling .,science
mark rober wa yelling in my ear .,science
but these mad robotics quadruped are currently being used hopefully for underground activity for mining for emergency situation and maybe now for underwater work a . i will never forget the sound of these robot .,science
yeah i used to always think if the if a robot uprising happened youd hop on a boat somewhere but no no thank you .,science
no robot thats what i am here for .,science
steve thank you much for joining u on the show tonight .,science
it is fun that you you stayed and that you are still here .,science
yeah thanks for thanks for letting me join you .,science
yeah it wa a fun combo for sure .,science
yeah i enjoyed it .,science
thank you .,science
and everybody out there thank you much for joining u justin .,science
i think we got to the end of another episode of this week in science .,science
it is time for me to say lot of thank yous .,science
thank you to everyone in the chat room for being here and talking and for commenting and for leading some of our aside in the conversation .,science
additionally thank you to who we have gord and aran lore who helped keep the chat room happy nice place to be .,science
thank you to fada for helping with social medium and show description .,science
thank you to rachel for editing the show .,science
thank you to identity four for recording the show .,science
and thank you much to our twist patron .,science

and i would also to tell you that we will be back next wednesday with more of this week in science .,science
and a guest our guest is going to be i am going to make juliana fortier who will be coming to u from uc berkeley greater good science center .,science
and shes going to be talking with u about some of their recent initiative and some very exciting stuff .,science
let all be good people .,science
yes and we will be back .,science
did we already say this ?,science
well be back .,science
but then i said but with an interview .,science
wednesday eight p.m. pacific time .,science
and then another show at five a.m. thursday central european time .,science
you could pick which one you want to attend .,science
and we will be broadcasting those show live from our twitch youtube and facebook channel .,science
and if you want to listen to u a a podcast search for this week in science wherever podcasts are found .,science

we can also sign up for a newsletter that you might never even have to receive .,science
i do not think a newsletter for four year .,science
you can send u an email though about our newsletter if you want .,science
if you would to write a newsletter for this week in science please contact u . we love your feedback .,science
if there a topic you want u to address or cover suggest for an interview let u know .,science
one of our social medium account might be there or send u an email .,science
put twist in the subject line it doesnt get spam filtered into the bottom of the ocean with one of those fourlegged robot .,science
i will never be near that .,science
we look forward to discussing all great thing about science again with you next week if youve learned anything from this show .,science
remember it is all in your head .,science
you might have to dance .,science
this week in science .,science
this week in science .,science
this week in science .,science
this week in science .,science
this week in science .,science
it is the end of the world i am setting up a shop got my banner unfurled .,science
it say the scientist is in .,science
show them how to stop the robot with a simple device .,science
ill reverse global warming with a wave of my hand .,science
and all itll cost you is a couple of grand .,science
this week in science is coming your way .,science
everybody listen to what i say .,science
i use the scientific method for all that is worth .,science
and ill broadcast my opinion all over the earth .,science
cause it is this week in science .,science
this week in science .,science
this week in science .,science
this week in science .,science
this week in science .,science
this week in science .,science
and we are back with the twist after show .,science
and it is already after after hour .,science
it is now past seven am since your european time .,science
it is still completely dark outside .,science
i think that weve shifted .,science
it is shifted into those .,science
sorry ive shifted into those .,science
those darkness hour .,science
at some point there going to be light from around ten am until three pm .,science
thats not what we had .,science
let see what are they saying ?,science
thats not central european type .,science
thats far north i guess .,science
not the ... do you feel that at all where you are at ?,science
the effect of the sunlight change ?,science
i went to grad school in minnesota and i said i grew up in denver but then i spent time in texas and then up to minnesota .,science
and i could feel the reality of it during the winter of the lack of sunlight .,science
are you getting any of that ?,science
yeah because i think denmark might be about a far north a calgary or something that .,science
maybe even a little further north than that .,science
and then when you get off of work it is dark .,science
and you wonder ha the sun gone away ?,science
because you will not encounter it in a day .,science
it is wild .,science
now the converse though is also interesting .,science
because the converse is in the peak summer time .,science
you will have sunlight till eleven oclock at night .,science
and then the sun will be showing up at four oclock in the morning .,science
and then youll be around .,science
it get dark and you are what is that ?,science
people live in darkness .,science
how do you do that ?,science
how do you function ?,science
how do you go out in late in the evening and still see everything ?,science
yeah when my kid were young my spouse and i were glad that we were living in southern california and not one of those area .,science
because it is easy to tell the kid it is time to go to bed .,science
they can accept that .,science
but if it doesnt get dark until one thousand one hundred and thirty no no thats a problem .,science
then you need blackout curtains. . and a whole ... i think i had to improvise in the beginning with ... and this worked amazingly .,science
a spray water spray bottle on the window and then putting aluminum foil .,science
and it stick .,science
it is and blocked out the window until i could go and pick up blackout curtain which is the thing i did not realize that i needed .,science
the best blackout curtain in the world are in the northern country .,science
but yeah but then and then you get to winter and you do not have any use for them at all .,science
it is ... but then it is all electricity or i guess whale fat .,science
we are using solar a lot in california .,science
for power but then you need battery .,science
you need to power the christmas light somehow .,science
come on .,science
i laughed at that .,science
but that is ... that is when i wa in greenland for six week .,science
thats how the cabin i wa in wa heated .,science
it wa a narwhal blower that wa being used a the heating source .,science
not a convenient a all the water pipe underneath the city of reykjavik .,science
thats for sure .,science
and then ive told this story before but there wa no piping in this little greenland village .,science
there wa a bucket and i got there with a bunch of researcher .,science
it wa nine or ten of u sharing this one cabin and they were gon na go off and do this for the expedition .,science
we all got there and i wa i wa there a toilet .,science
and then i realized it is with a bucket under .,science
and it wa we had been there nine ten of u for i think three day .,science
and the whole time i am what do they do with this bucket ?,science
because they are there a crew that come by and take care of the bucket .,science
but i am how do they clean the bucket ?,science
where is their water source for that ?,science
and how did they that seems a intense job .,science
turn out unbeknownst to anybody that wa there there are these rubber durable bag that are supposed to be put into the bucket .,science
the crew when they came wa rather upset .,science
they taken the bag .,science
did not put together that you obviously need a liner for the bucket for them to transport it away .,science
here a room full of phd .,science
horribly mortified by the fact that they hadnt put together that this make no sense .,science
it is magically going to take care of itself .,science
i wa i thought yeah it is going to win .,science
i we were all can not wait to see how they handle this .,science
do they take the put a new bucket ?,science
are they going to bring a fresh bucket and then take that one away and it go somewhere and get cleaned and where do they clean it ?,science
because they are wheres and hence wa your learned the usefulness of informational visuals .,science
this is a lack of knowledge .,science
very quickly .,science
eric knapp in the chat room beaten by a honey bucket .,science
my goodness .,science
i am excited about our inner our conversation next week .,science
talking about humanizing humanization across divide a opposed to dehumanization which ha led to much .,science
i am excited about next week also .,science
what else do you have going on steve ?,science
yeah we are here hanging out now .,science
i am here hanging out but we are yeah this time of the year we are getting term paper and thing that .,science
lot of exciting grading going to be happening over the next little bit. . now thats exciting .,science
i am excited about grading .,science
id be great .,science
i do think it is exciting .,science
you do think it is exciting ?,science
you do. . you do not have an army of teaching assistant that .,science
no no weve even got a policy here that ta can be used for big class but even then it can only be for grading thing that are objectively scored .,science
and ive got colleague who teach large or teach a stats class and a stats class you can objectively score whether or not the formula were calculated but ive got going to be having some term paper coming in in the next little bit .,science
and we wouldnt want to be having ta grading those .,science
and yeah but thats something that i enjoy being a part of the process of helping people learn how to write and and walking them through that process to become stronger writer .,science
one thing that we did not talk about with your with your work is your interest in open science .,science
i think and weve talked about before the the replication project to try and replicate a whole bunch of psychology research to make sure it is whether or not it wa good and yeah .,science
how did you get involved in that ?,science
i wa ive got a ive got a a number in my head thats probably pulled from nowhere that sixty something percent of the fundamental research that underpins psychology ha not been replicatable .,science
it is it is i do not know if it is that big but i know that there a lot of it that hasnt necessarily seen rigorous replication .,science
yeah and i have run into that myself .,science
it is i i used to teach the intro to side class .,science
i do not teach that now .,science
and many of the most fun story to tell and most fun study to talk about i now can not talk about the last time i taught i wa i do not know that i can believe this study .,science
there there one cool study that made the argument that if you if you have people watch a film holding a hand in their key they are using a lot of the same muscle that they use to smile and theyll rate it a more funny .,science
but if you hold it in your mouth in a way thats using some of the frowning muscle though theyll re rate the same video clip le enjoyably .,science
and sad to know that that study doesnt replicate because thats a fun one to talk about .,science
and yeah that psych ha been hit hard especially my end of psychology is the personality slash social psychology .,science
and thats where some of the biggest scandal came out in that branch of the psychology or sub branch of psychology .,science
but i am i am a the i am the editor of the journal of psych the psych journal of psychological research psych is the honor society of psychology .,science
and i am the journal editor for that .,science
registration is extremely important because you declared i am going to look at this and then you publish the result on it versus we ran thirty version of this study .,science
here the one we .,science
thats the only thing that the public see if it is not registered ?,science
because when when a study is evaluated with when we are looking for statistical significance we are with the standard cutoff level accepting a one in twenty chance of getting data that are not accurate accurate .,science
if we run twenty study it is very likely that one of them may become statistically significant even if there no effect there .,science
and if i continue to torture the data until i find something statistically significant i might i might end up with an article .,science
torture the data .,science
it is it is a real thing .,science
it is and and i ive got to even acknowledge that my own process of research ha become stronger because there were time when it wa try a different type of analysis or maybe double the sample size and let see what happens .,science
and now we are reminding ourselves no thats not what we teach our student in research methodology class .,science
we shouldnt be doing that either .,science
and i think thats a a good evolution for psychology to be buying into all these open science method and replication stuff .,science
i went to an open science the what are they the there a a society for open science or something that .,science
center for open science and yes the center for open science .,science
and they had a meeting a couple of week ago and it wa interesting to sit in on it and hear what people were saying about the platform and the methodology .,science
and it seems it is it is a lot there a lot of infrastructure thats being built to support it now .,science
and i i guess i with all of the normal methodology of what stats program and how you are going to do everything how realistic is it ?,science
do you think that this is going to grow and do you do you think do you are you optimistic that it is going to be something that influence science that it is going to be picked up by a large part of the community ?,science
it is going to it is going to prevent u from having this ability to go out and discover if we have to preregister everything .,science
and i saw a lot of hesitation when that movement first started but now people are accepting that no it doesnt have to .,science
it is take an extra step and make it public .,science
what are you wanting to find out ?,science
we all have to go through the process of getting our study approved by an ethic board .,science
it doesnt take too much extra work to also then put in a publicly accessible place ahead of time .,science
i am going to gather data from this many subject .,science
i am going to run these analysis .,science
i am hoping to find out this .,science
yeah thats a best practice and i see more and more acceptance of it .,science
i am thinking of animal study and human there the the ethic board but then also if you are going and getting animal out of the wild you have to list how many animal you want and all this stuff .,science
there there all sort of place where you already have this information planned out .,science
yeah it wouldnt be thinking a you are explaining it it wouldnt be a big step and then youve got it all .,science
and for publication it is weve already got it there .,science
maybe it is a whole process easier .,science
it almost a red flag at some point especially if it is especially if it is any a health claim where there is a thing you could take that would fix it whatever that may be .,science
you do not get to see anything .,science
and there no you can see the data but there not a preregistration .,science
it mean you got a version of a study .,science
thats the red flag .,science
thats the assumption i make is you got the version that made that connection and you have no idea how many three four fifty time they ran version of that study where they did not find that connection .,science
and thats thats the thing that thats where where i get i do not see it .,science
i do not see that they they they they said in advance that they were going to do this study and hold themselves accountable to that result .,science
the one thing i would love to have seen i always talk about this and i wish i had the wherewithal the finance if i wa a multibazillionaire or a good community organizer i would love to see a journal of no result .,science
here a here a an entire journal dedicated to failed replication study .,science
is not there one ?,science
it is not popular but there is one .,science
even then even if you run run a study that maybe did not fail to replicate but you are the researcher you ran the study and then once you were done and got your result you say the hypothesis did not show up with a signal .,science
those that is a viable resource .,science
because whether it is an animal study or a psychological study or whatever the if you do not have a it would be a great research we could go doe this been looked at before ? ?,science
can i say there fifteen different study that tried to connect these and found no link and no association or no but they went about it with this particular particular methodology .,science
and maybe if i try it this way itll be that said more fruitful pathway .,science
it is difficult because i completely agree with you but journal want to have article that are going to be you are we want an impact factor .,science
and well try some study but we will not we will sidestudies that get significant result .,science
and you need to find you need to not do that .,science
i think it would be interesting because i think you could at some point incentivize citing no result .,science
we looked at this because we saw ten the these study had no result these study had no result these study had no and cite them .,science
this is why we went in this direction because we saw unpromising research in the other direction .,science
it seems it could be cited .,science
but if the if it is with the .,science
but if the if we are if we are putting those thing in initially and registering the study and then it doesnt work out then it is that wa done .,science
majority of thing put into the clinical trial do not have the result that they were hoping for expecting .,science
but every time that happens it is searchable .,science
you can look at method dosage amount what were the interaction that there were the mechanism that they were hoping would take place .,science
and then you can ask why did not it work ?,science
yeah i can see why it should have .,science
is there something in between ?,science
is it mitigating the response or wa it the dosage were not or is this doesnt work ?,science
and i think that a lot of scientist i wa worked under neil sharkey who wa at uc davis the head of the orthopedics research lab went on to do head of research and development at penn state .,science
and he had told me at one point that something ninety of animal trial and experimentation in orthopedics ha been done probably at every university .,science
because this is also this very long time ago .,science
this is almost before a shared internet environment ?,science
but that information because it is not shared those study keep getting repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated for people trying to connect what should be logical connection but are not there .,science
and yeah the journal of null result of the lack of confirmation the journal that i think would be a wonderful database for people to be able to search before engaging in their own research to see the pitfall that have come .,science
the literature review ?,science
the center for open science ha already been mentioned and that one of their tool one of their resource is the open science framework .,science
and thats wonderful because it ha a built in pre registration system and you can search it you can not search the published literature but also search osf to see what other people have tried the similar type of thing to find those kind of null result .,science
thats brilliant .,science
and you can say hey i wanted to do this study this way .,science
and then if somebody doing something you can reach out and be hey i am going to do it this .,science
do you want to collaborate or not ?,science
and suddenly maybe you are working together and driving thing forward faster .,science
yeah absolutely .,science
it is one thousand and thirty here on the western hemisphere which is getting a little late .,science
i know some of our viewer are on the east coast .,science
i am respecting the super late nighttime of some of these people and the ever i can not say earlier it is the later morning for justin .,science
the marked in our discord chat room shared this robot .,science
i want to because we ended on the robot noise shared this robot that our robot story reminded him of .,science
and this is supported look by darpa .,science
these military lobster robot this is what it is out there .,science
boy and see they say they are boy and see claw .,science
it is a lot of fun .,science
thank you for sharing that on the discord .,science
thats super fun .,science
but it is only one thousand one hundred and thirty .,science
what kyle is fantastic .,science
wheres kira one hundred and thirty am where can that even be ?,science
kira cent one hundred and thirty is it would be one thousand two hundred and thirty one thirty east coast east coast or canada .,science
i am that doesnt make any .,science
of course that make sense .,science
yeah you are six hour away from eight hour .,science
we we need to get play tectonics and time zone .,science
we need to all to have the same time zone and get on the same page .,science
there you go .,science
thanks for joining u from billy kira .,science
thats awesome .,science
all steve thank you once again for joining u . this ha been super fun .,science
thanks for staying up late with u . great talking with you both .,science
i will i will see steve .,science
hope i see you again in life .,science
kiki i will hopefully see you again in life because ill only be next week .,science
and if i do not then that is a real problem .,science
and everyone i will say we hope to see you again next week .,science
and in the meantime stay safe stay healthy stay curious and stay lucky .,science
thank you .,science

thats what we are supposed to do here .,science
friend are you ready ?,science
are you ready for this science show ?,science
is my microphone going ?,science
yes flying out one host .,science
thats it tonight but we have a guest it is going to be fantastic .,science
it always is fantastic .,science
it is time .,science
i am waiting for the thumb up from the audience .,science
let do this .,science
i am already here let start the show in three two this is twist .,science

i want to fill it all up with new discovery that happen every day of the week .,science
there only one place to go to find the knowledge i seek .,science
i want to know whats happening .,science
whats happening .,science
whats happening this week in science .,science
whats happening .,science
whats happening this week in science .,science
good science to everyone .,science
welcome to another episode of this week in science .,science
and thank you much for joining u for this wonderful twisawine episode of this week in science .,science
i am alone in the podcast tonight to bring you the science but i will be joined by a guest .,science
we have an interview with juliana tafour from the greater good science center at uc berkeley .,science
on this week show i have a few quick story for you about mirroring life reanimating virus and scary clown .,science
why do not we them ?,science
there science on that now .,science
people want to know why do not we scary clown ?,science
what is it about them ?,science
what happened to you that made you not the clown everybody ?,science
everyone ha a story .,science
everyone ha a story .,science
a we jump into the story tonight i do want to remind all of you that subscribing to twis a a podcast you can find u on your favorite podcast platform .,science
we also stream live wednesday eight p.m. pacific time youtube facebook and twitch .,science
and if you look for this week in science or twis science on social platform or these platform i told you about you are going to find u . if it is too much information for you remember that our website is twis.org .,science
and you can find lot of great information there show note .,science
and you can contact u through comment and all sort of thing that .,science
we hope that you are doing it .,science
come on .,science
my gosh it is the end of october .,science
but i am not scared .,science
it is time for science .,science
we are going to dive in here .,science
into the mirror land first .,science
what do when i am talking about the mirror land ?,science
it is not the inside out .,science
it is not the upside down .,science
it is alice in wonderland stepping through the mirror into the flip side of the world .,science
a me now i am flipped .,science
a i see myself i am putting my hand up but maybe my left hand is coming up or it look my left hand is coming up and waving at you .,science
it is my hand .,science
thats the way that the camera work and the way that it put u forward to the world .,science
thats what i am seeing a i am looking at this camera and at this screen .,science
and you are seeing me flipped .,science
but if we are looking in a regular mirror your hand should come up to match it evenly ?,science
even stevens everything match .,science
how doe that work ?,science
my goodness light reflection thats a whole other story .,science
but in the molecular world whats fascinating is that we do not do that .,science
we do have these handed molecule .,science
they are called enantiomer .,science
and if you were to pick your left hand up and then your hand and turn it over .,science
it is back to front front to back .,science
that is not an enantiomer .,science
they are opposite of each other and flipped around one of the vertex .,science
everything or most thing in life are handed in one way or another .,science
and most of the molecule are one of these enantiomer in biology .,science
at one point chemistry which make when molecule are created make molecule of the left handed form and the handed form .,science
and they go about their business being created for whatever reason a molecular reaction occur .,science
in biology thing got handed the same way that the majority of people are handed .,science
and do not let that teacher in school tell you get your handed .,science
if you are left handed thats not going to work out very for you in the long run .,science
now for biology though it work out great because we have molecule that fit together puzzle piece because of this handedness .,science
the handedness allows u to have dna .,science
and then the dna ha copy of different molecule that fit with them thats called rna .,science
and the rna can then go and become a copyish of the dna .,science
it get the dna it is transcribed we call it when it turn into rna .,science
the rna get carried to a ribosome and then it get turned into amino acid .,science
those amino acid become protein .,science
and then we say that the dna the gene have been translated into the protein that are active within our body and allow u to function .,science
now some thing in the nucleus of cell do not go on to become protein .,science
they stay rna .,science
they are rna enzyme .,science
rna can make thing happen within the nucleus of the cell .,science
the rna enzyme can cause gene to be transcribed more or le .,science
the rna enzyme can change function of thing within the nucleus itself .,science
they can move outside of the cell and go do other thing altogether .,science
rna is this cool thing .,science
it doe it own thing .,science
and scientist think that rna may have been the precursor to dna that maybe rna came first .,science
and if rna came first how did it start making itself ?,science
one of the thing for life is selfreplication .,science
if molecule can selfreplicate keep copying copying copying copying they are capable of making new form of being used to create new molecule to cause all the stuff that happens in our cell for new life to form for it to go on and on and on and on .,science
researcher at the salk institute and also at upv euha a research group the metal catalysis and organocatalysis research group at the rovira and virgilie university and also at the university of the basque country .,science
researcher have published a couple of separate study but each of them are investigating this handedness of molecule and how to do what biology is .,science
how do we get molecule to be lefthanded or handed and then possibly use those in antiimmers a therapeutic agent ?,science
and even further the work at the salk institute which i absolutely absolutely enamored of is theyve worked on these rna enzyme .,science
it is a selfreplicating system using rna with these mirror image and potentially this is one of the step that is necessary for molecule rna to perpetuate themselves and for function that go on to become life to even become possible .,science
i am very excited about this particular study .,science
we are in a mirror world we live in it already but if we can create enantiomer protein the fascinating aspect of this therapeutically is our body may not respond to certain enantiomer and will not be this is dangerous because it is not the handedness .,science
maybe they will not recognize them and break them down in the same way that they would the other mirror image of them .,science
it is possible that these mirror image enzyme and molecule and selfperpetuating system could be used for benefit in our own health system moving forward .,science
well go from our scary mirror world to the benefit of these rna molecule .,science
and now i am going to move on from these handed lefthanded rna bit to another study about pregnancy because we are talking about life .,science
why wouldnt i move on to pregnancy ?,science
but this is a scary pregnancy story .,science
did that when you become pregnant a lot of you out there are not of the uterine persuasion .,science
maybe you are not going to become pregnant but people become pregnant .,science
and when they do it ha been discovered that something hidden in our dna awakens is reanimated .,science
what are you talking about ?,science
we know that there are silent portion of dna that come from old virus that get activated to create the placenta .,science
and additionally this particular process that wa studied researcher from the u.s. and germany studying mouse found an immune response that lead to an increase in red blood cell production .,science
the researcher were thats interesting. . the placenta the body we need more red blood cell during this period of time .,science
this is pretty important but shouldnt the immune system be shutting down this viral production of protein of gene ?,science
whats going on here ?,science
obviously there is some importance to these bit of dna that have been historically called junk dna because they do not become active unless they are triggered by very specific instance for instance pregnancy .,science
they took these pregnant mouse and they looked to see what happened when they turned off the ability of this particular system to work and the mouse became anemic and their pregnancy failed .,science
they tested this in human a and they found the same system becomes activated in human who become pregnant .,science
there are these retro transposon is what they are called .,science
these bit of dna that got stuck into our dna these gene that got stuck into our dna once upon a time .,science
and in doing this they got transposed over and over again and made copy were made they were maybe inverted and turned around .,science
the dna kept copying them .,science
why did not they get erased ?,science
why werent they cut up ?,science
sometimes i do not know i have a junk drawer but i do go through it and clean it out occasionally .,science
and biology is most likely going to do that if it can .,science
we know that we have these retro transposon they are very important .,science
and now that we have determined that these junk dna segment of code from little virus can be triggered by very specific reprogramming or restructuring instance that they can be incredibly important .,science
and these viral infection passed down from our ancestor are important because they are involved in pregnancy .,science
theyve only shown it far in this blood forming system but they think that there are other stem cell that coopt these retro transposon and immune sensor a during tissue regeneration .,science
how do we know how much of this is being allowed by the immune system ?,science
how much of this is being blocked by the immune system ?,science
is this part of some of the disease related to pregnancy ?,science
there much that we do not understand .,science
this research wa published in science magazine this last week .,science
and understanding it could help u figure out anemia during pregnancy and lead to more healthy pregnancy if we can figure it out .,science
all my last story because once we go from pregnant mom of course we are going to go to the kid and all those kid birthday party with the clown .,science
i know everyone ha a story out there .,science
this is a phenomenon known a the fear of clown .,science
this is our word of the day everyone if you want to remember this word .,science
and this fear is present in adult also in child .,science
the research that wa published researcher enacted the fear of clown questionnaire .,science
thats the fear of clown questionnaire .,science
using this fear of clown questionnaire they had a sample of nine hundred and eighty seven people between eighteen and seventy seven year of age .,science
they discovered that the individual in this study and these are people in south wale people in south wale this study wa taken into place at university of south wale .,science
the researcher found that woman are more afraid of clown than men .,science
we do not know exactly why that is .,science
we also know that a lot of people are afraid of clown because of traumatic experience .,science
but what is it that lead to the traumatic experience ?,science
at least half of the respondent had a fear of clown with five being extremely afraid of clown .,science
and this is higher than injection fear needle phobia three fear of height two.eight a fear of closed space twenty two.two and a fear of flying is only one.three of people .,science
this is a fairly in their sample a fairly high amount although this is fewer than onezero people .,science
it can be taken with a grain of salt .,science
however how do the origin of this fear come into play ?,science
and they now have a new set of question a explanation for the origin of our fear of clown .,science
the makeup is uncanny valley .,science
it is doll or mannequin .,science
they do not look quite human .,science
and that eerie or unsettling feeling occurs due to the makeup .,science
the exaggerated facial feature convey a direct sense of threat .,science
the big eye the big mouth everything is threatening a opposed to friendly even though the big mouth is supposed to be friendly .,science
this one is interesting .,science
the clown makeup hide emotional signal and creates uncertainty for people .,science
maybe it is that uncertainty about what is going to be coming .,science
for the color of clown makeup reminds u of death infection or blood injury and evokes disgust or avoidance .,science
this is a fascinating one .,science
is it the red color ?,science
the i do not know .,science
i am not going to go any further on that one but this is an interesting question to look into .,science
five clown unpredictable behavior make people uncomfortable .,science
fear of clown ha been learned from other people .,science
and maybe those portrayal are again teaching through society .,science
and then i said lot of people have a frightening experience with a clown .,science
they discovered through their work that this even though a lot of people have scary experience that wa the lowest level of agreement .,science
this is not the explanation for why most people have a fear of the clown .,science
they discovered that for a lot of people the negative portrayal of clown in popular culture wa a big factor in leading to their fear .,science
maybe ronald mcdonalds i do not know maybe pennywise i am not sure whatever .,science
but the hidden emotional signal wa what they found a the largest factor in their research when they asked people question related to all of their question .,science
they discovered that it wa because the clown true face are hidden .,science
and we do not understand the emotional intent and there uncertainty .,science
we do not know whether they are angry or sad or whether they are happy .,science
we do not know whats going to happen .,science
maybe that lead into other aspect of their their behavior and what we think about them .,science
is it the makeup ?,science
whats going on with clown everybody ?,science
i am not going to be afraid of clown although maybe i am not going to watch stephen king it anytime soon .,science
this is this week in science .,science
thank you much for joining me for this episode .,science
while i have been running down a couple of story related to our twistaweed celebration it is time for me to bring a guest into the show that we can have a good conversation .,science
it is time for that .,science
before i do i want to say thanks everyone for watching .,science
if you are enjoying the show make sure to share with a friend .,science
you can head over to twist.org and click on our patreon link .,science
thats where you can help support the show a part of our community .,science
if you are interested in merchandise there some holiday coming up pretty soon .,science
you can support the show through our zazzle store .,science
go to twist.org and click either on the patreon link or the zazzle link or both and take yourself down that twist rabbit hole .,science
can not do it without you .,science
thank you much for your support .,science
coming on back it is time for more this week in science .,science
it is time for me to introduce our guest for the evening .,science
our guest tonight is juliana tufour .,science
and juliana is the inaugural director of bridging difference program at uc berkeley greater good science center a colombian american .,science
her work focus on strengthening social connection across line of race religion culture politics and more in order to foster a culture of understanding and belonging in the united state and beyond .,science
juliana welcome to the show .,science
thank you much for joining me .,science
it is good to be here .,science
thank you for the invite .,science
you are welcome .,science
it is a joy to be able to get you on the show to talk about some stuff that ive personally been working on in my own science communication work and my own life because it is it is time for that .,science
how are you feeling ?,science
thank you for asking .,science
yeah i decided month ago that i wanted to do something about the anxiety that i wa sure to feel around this time .,science
i decided to launch this seven day challenge a part of a campaign for connection .,science
at the greater good science center we have been not campaigning for a candidate but campaigning for connection .,science
and thats not because we do not believe in who should be the winner of this election ?,science
we are not into mushy middle ground and flattening of identity .,science
we are who we are .,science
and from that point forward weve reached difference .,science
but i knew myself and i knew that i needed to do this to not fall into the pattern of the news cycle and the constant update and the bickering and the fear response that naturally our body go to .,science
it is wonderful to have an outlet and be busy that i can not do much .,science
that could be part of it ?,science
you do not have time to think about all the emotional stuff and go down the rabbit hole and circle down the drain of emotion .,science
but what is this seven day campaign and what brought you to starting it ?,science
whats going on and howd you get here ?,science
yeah absolutely .,science
i do want to acknowledge that yes although i have been super busy it is heartbreaking ?,science
to see the current state of division and polarization and especially the rhetoric that is set on dividing u and turning u into them and them into u . and for many me who devote our life to this work it is heartdrenching ?,science
and thank you for popping up the campaign for connection .,science
some of the same reason that we are seeing now ?,science
but in two thousand and sixteen for the first time a long a i could remember i think the bickering and the fear wa strong that i wanted to attempt to understand people who i wa having a hard time understanding .,science
and all i could feel wa this othering is leading to more othering in my own life .,science
and those are complex and people call them trigger issue people will call them the hot button contested controversial topic in our politics .,science
thats something people say do not talk about religion or politics at the dinner table .,science
have you always talked about religion and politics at the dinner table ?,science
yeah for me i think i grew up hearing over and over again that people had story that people were made of story that we were all unique and different a a result of our story .,science
and that wa repeated to me much .,science
i think it wa part of how my dad saw the world and invited u to see the world maybe intentionally maybe unintentionally i do not know .,science
but he would be the type that when we would drive past the bus stop full of people he would always turn to u and be look at all those people look at all those story .,science
yeah it is the question of how can you if where somebody came from ?,science
yeah you said dr. kiki i run the bridging difference program at the greater good science center and we translate research to practice for those of you who know who we are and what we do at the greater good and it is based out of uc berkeley .,science
and the translation of the science of human connection how is it that across our difference we can still expand our circle of concern for people who might be out of our group or different from u and thats what we do every day of our life .,science
this campaign for connection is a little part of what we do within the bridging program .,science
we have program in higher ed and in community .,science
all of that is true but there hope there truly hope in that seventy five of american believe it is important to hear different political view even when they do not agree with all of them .,science
seventy five of american desire a shift in political discourse and believe that moving beyond political hostility and divisiveness is a positive step forward .,science
we are tapping into this exhausted majority group that is often not the loudest group ?,science
it is not the group we are hearing from in social medium it is not the group that is informing this perception of the reality that we think we all live in which is divided and hopelessly divided ?,science
it is a group thats quieter thats truly exhausted and tough out and we are providing them with sciencebased skill that they know that this is possible that they see example of this being possible and they can try it out .,science
and at the core of it truly is that division hurt u . we want people to know that science also tell u that it hurt not only our relationship a we all know and have experience but it hurt our being .,science
and obviously i think we are all aware that division also hurt the very fabric of our democracy .,science
there the division is one thing but then the absolute polarization thats been occurring is another aspect to it that extreme the rift growing ?,science
we can have disagreement we can have thing i can want something that you do not want but if we can not talk about it here the question is how is science helping here ?,science
what science is there that suggests that there are method or way forward ?,science
for u in the bridging difference program it all started with a bridging difference playbook where we have fourteen sciencebased skill for bridging difference and the playbook continues to grow .,science
some of those skill which we are promoting and sharing a part of the campaign involve thing that you can do at the intrapersonal level you can do yourself to either get yourself ready or to reset or after youve engaged with someone .,science
they are interpersonal skill that you can have with someone else and then there intergroup skill which are skill that we teach for people who are more bridgeers for people who are bringing folk together actively .,science
do they pot or not ?,science
yeah it is that is not where i would have started .,science
how interesting ?,science
no yeah because what it doe is it tap into our fear of response and fear of broccoli .,science
it almost hap our brain when we are encounter or encounter threat or fear and our amygdala is reacting we tap into that by asking ourselves these question that then in turn make u see the person a another human with unique quality and trait we do ?,science
yeah and then you ask is a hot dog a sandwich ?,science
and the debate begin .,science
yeah exactly .,science
yeah and thats thats an easy one .,science
ill tell you about a particular study also involving the skill of seeing the person and not the label or ive also called it in the past humanizing not categorizing .,science
i think in our bridging difference playbook we call it something else but ive moved away from that title .,science
but the idea here there wa another study that introduced this character fictitious character named alex to people .,science
and some people were told alex wa a democrat or a republican .,science
and others were told shes a democrat or a republican but here what she ha for breakfast .,science
and here where she work and here are detail of her personal life her family .,science
and again what they found wa that for those who knew yes her political party but also these personal detail about her from her social medium feed they were able to not have warmer feeling towards her although they still disagreed with her political position .,science
it is all about getting to know the personal detail and how that begin to create war that we can then engage in a different way .,science
thats one for starter but we can continue talking about others .,science
no i think it is a somebody who ha a bit of neurodivergence and is busily trying to remember somebody name and go through my mental trick when i meet somebody in person to remember their name .,science
oftentimes there are other bit and piece of information that are lost and because i am trying to remember their name .,science
and i am basing a lot on behavior and how people are acting physically their face their face facial expression and their body language .,science
is there any science beyond the actual information about people life into how we can how we can see other people and view them a human other people u a not other and view them with compassion .,science
yeah there there several thing that i can point to but i guess whats most might be a little off script from your playbook but yeah yeah yeah .,science
i guess i guess whats most present a you ask that question is the power of listening which is one that i always gravitate towards .,science
it wa also my entryway into this work and i truly love it .,science
and you have a ted talk or tedx talk on listening .,science
it wa great .,science
yeah but i listening with compassion for a number of reason and it is and it is i do not think it directly answer your question .,science
i wanted a good topic .,science
go ahead you can touch and turn .,science
it is fabulous .,science
i will remind me about your question which wa more connected to what we can see. ?,science
and i guess thats why listening wa present because because there much we can see when we listen .,science
there much we can grasp that perhaps we did not know wa there .,science
and we are talking about this deep listening a in almost listening with the intent to cocreate listening with the intent to open your heart to someone and allow in in the listening for them to be seen for them to make sense of their story .,science
when we listen we are listening to not only word but you said we are listening to body gesture movement we are listening to energy we want to get spiritual .,science
we listen to much more than word which is i think why your question led me to listening .,science
and and then there also all the science of listening .,science
but i want to whats present now is this beautiful quote by david augsberger .,science
it is a quote i love and i often cite but in this book old book called carrying enough to confront but he say being listened to is close to being loved that for the average percent they are almost indistinguishable .,science
that is a big one .,science
thats strong .,science
it make you pause for a minute because it tap into something we all know and understand which is this fundamental need desire that we all have to be listened to .,science
and and also something thats present for all of u which is we are not listened to very much ?,science
and especially in these divisive time we feel we are not listened to we are not understood we are not seen .,science
i want to i want to mention the science of listening and the power of the science of listening because people do not know it have heard of it .,science
and it start plain and simple if we want to be understood we should truly start by listening more closely to folk .,science
the question is why ?,science
that sound good but why ?,science
what doe science tell u about it ?,science
and what science tell u is that when we listen we are perceived immediately are perceived by the other person the person who listening to u who we are listening to a more trustworthy .,science
and it also encourages our conversation partner to be more openminded and to be le defensive .,science
and in some case science ha also shown le focus on their selfinterest .,science
it is this powerful powerful technique that if you enter a conversation with this openness and willingness to listen not necessarily because you will open the other person to listen to you but because you want to serve them .,science
and what end up happening is you transform them you transform how they see you how they engage with you .,science
it is powerful .,science
it is a secret secret .,science
the secret oops sorry i am taking my microphone i am excited .,science
the secret to social interaction is listening .,science
who knew ?,science
when you are and then there the neuroscience of it a that when you are listening you are doing the physical behavioral manifestation of paying attention .,science
and that it lead to a synchronization and it help to benefit that synchronization of neural pathway between individual .,science
yes yes i love that .,science
and it is powerful to be reminded of that .,science
yes and that tie back to your question .,science
listening more than word listening to body and listening to brain .,science
what are we listening ?,science
yeah one of the hardest part though that we have seen much that ive learned about in research having been a neuroscientist and i love all this stuff interpersonal neuroscience i think it is fun .,science
but the connection between u very often though it is the one person is trying to predict the brain of a one person is trying to predict where the other person brain is going to go .,science
and the synchronization is occurring because of eye blink and auditory signal and that prediction engine that our brain are .,science
and but at the same time because of the prediction we can get caught up in what we think is going to be coming .,science
and what we think we have to say next that we are not paying attention to what is coming out of the other person mouth .,science
and i think thats where the neuroscience of it is we got to break that pattern that behavioral pattern ?,science
and we have this framework for compassionate listening .,science
and thats thats one of the thing we say ?,science
are you listening focused on the conversation ?,science
almost mentally anchoring on what the speaker is saying without necessarily preparing a response in your mind ?,science
and this awareness that when we do that we are automatically not present anymore .,science
we have lost it .,science
we are not listening listening in it full fullness of the word ?,science
then we add listening with compassion or active listening .,science
but but why do we need to when you listen you listen .,science
but yeah among the thing we share when when inviting folk to listen in addition to being present being curious starting with open ended question and encouraging the other person to share more a a affirming feeling and intention and almost experience ?,science
and affirming doe not mean agreeing with you are validating what the person went through .,science
you are acknowledging their emotion you are acknowledging their life story .,science
and then back to neuroscience this connection at the at the empathy level ?,science
trying to communicate to them that you truly understand why they feel the way they feel although you may not agree with it .,science
but you are agreeing with their experience and affirming them also .,science
and engage body language which i think you touched on a ?,science
listening to your body eye contact nodding open posture all of that speaks and say something also about the way that you listen .,science
there how we listen and also how we are coming into conversation or into interaction online or off trying to consider people a other human being a opposed to combatant .,science
are there any other specific method or research finding that you want to focus on ?,science
there there one that i feel is le obvious to most folk called self distancing .,science
when conversation get heated there this tendency to get cut up in our own thought and emotion .,science
and how much that prevents u from engaging constructively .,science
never never experienced that before .,science
you must not from this world .,science
yeah self distancing encourages u to view ourselves from an outsider perspective almost by thinking about yourself in the third person .,science
if i am getting angry about something instead of asking myself i am angry ?,science
i would take a step back and i would ask myself why ?,science
why is juliana angry ?,science
what about this is making her angry ?,science
what science show u is that this simple change in pronoun allows u to take a beat and zoom out and see the conversation almost from an outsider perspective i said and regain clarity and come back .,science
but no research .,science
doe the research suggest that it is that we can do this in the moment ?,science
is this something that take a lot of work to get good at ?,science
what we say is you would start this practice when math tension are not the highest when maybe you catch yourself seeing a post on social medium that is disturbing but you do not feel you are in the midst of it ?,science
and that a you practice and progressively get more comfortable doing this because it feel a little bit weird at first that when you are in a more heated conversation you are then able to go back to my body know how to do this .,science
ive tried this out before .,science
ive got the muscle for it ?,science
yeah we do recommend starting at a lower intensity. . lower risk level .,science
yeah absolutely .,science
and yeah and for example for campaign for connection when we are inviting people to try this out we are also asking people to set reminder on their phone and remind themselves during the day to pause .,science
we could do that over the next week ?,science
when we are caught up and anxious and stressed out and fearful of the election result if we pause for a few moment during the day and ask ourselves how is dr. kiki feeling ? .,science
it may seem awkward at first but it is this idea of this quick checkin and how can how that can help you reinforce the habit of observing rather than being absorbed by your emotion .,science
an invitation to check it out .,science
yeah all of it is an invitation .,science
and i and in this i hope that our listener can find some thing that they find useful ?,science
that maybe not everything is something they want to apply or can apply or these are not difficult thing to put into use in your own life .,science
but at the same time i wa talking with a friend the other day and she wa talking about the election and talking about the conversation with somebody else and how emotional she got and how she had to stop the conversation .,science
and there were no more spoon .,science
there no more mental energy to be able to even check in in that moment to keep the conversation going ?,science
but yeah i want to say to what you are saying and what your friend experienced and expressed to you bridging is not without risk ?,science
in that you do expose vulnerability .,science
we do say that it is not necessarily the thing for every person in every situation. . and that there are some people who maybe will not be bridge builder or not be bridge builder now .,science
and thats too .,science
what we go by is a long a someone opposing belief is not denying your existence and if respect is present then we can have these conversation and or enter into cooperation or collaboration across our difference because it is not only about conversation .,science
but it is important to remember that .,science
it is .,science
there in science communication we talk about it a lot which is the common method of giving scientific information which ha led to a lot of issue through the pandemic and also related to public health issue moving forward which is this delivering information .,science
and then you need to believe me and i am .,science
and then a soon a anyone try to come back with any commentary or debate it is an immediate an immediate assumption that that person is denying who they are the scientist .,science
social medium there is a lot of that for different individual and i am not going to deny that thats not going on .,science
social medium is a whole bag of worm .,science
all of a sudden we think thats and normal and fine and yeah social medium is complex .,science
i do want to say that what we know from science going back to why why even bridge ?,science
close mind ?,science
we know that prejudice and fear about the other any other elevates stress .,science
we also know that student feel safer le bullied and le lonely and more ethically integrated school .,science
we know it is good for family because many of u experience that we have a strange family member or we are no longer doing thanksgiving dinner .,science
there is research that point to thanksgiving dinner being a whole hour shorter .,science
and thats coming up .,science
and then and then taking it to workplace ?,science
if you want to deal with colleague who are different from you we do know that diverse team perform better with the skill and condition .,science
it is not about throwing a bunch of people who are different in a room and having them cooperate .,science
but but some of the skill are some of the skill we talk about ?,science
listening with compassion and truly seeking to understand a person story and self distancing if you need to selfregulate and come back to a conversation .,science
and i want to talk to you for the sake of connecting with you which is something that a lot of people may be inclined to do .,science
but if you are not inclined to do that and you still have to collaborate and find common goal with colleague because you have a joint project that you need to get out then thats another good reason to need to know how to collaborate across line of difference .,science
and and what we know about that is that when we understand that we need each other to achieve thing that are important to different group it may be the sale department and the marketing department of a company ?,science
working jointly we know that we shift from seeing people a adversary to collaborator .,science
and if nothing else for efficiency and improved process and and achieving thing that are important to u whether it is work wise or improving the quality of education of our child ?,science
and at board meeting being able to come together with folk who are different from you to achieve that goal .,science
and i think the the data that you brought up at the very beginning with the seventy five of people that is across party line thats across different age group and sex and seventy five of people would to bridge are tired of all of this .,science
but yeah there is a common there a commonality there .,science
there is and i think thats common goal .,science
there is .,science
and id to emphasize that because i can stay in the we are hopelessly divided ?,science
and and we will not reach anyone with that rhetoric because people are already tapped out .,science
know even though there a negativity bias in people if there is not hope people do not want to do it .,science
there nothing there nothing people are though i can not do anything about it whatever .,science
whats the hope ?,science
and a reminder that across the political spectrum research ha shown u that democrat and republican value or conservatism liberal to not give it a label .,science
everything is this .,science
come on everything is binary .,science
and that we value different thing ?,science
the idea is that a you are having a conversation with someone that you understand is different from you getting at the root of what is what value is most important to you ?,science
or what experience have shaped value that are more important to you ?,science
and how that give you clue a to how to approach them on this thing that also matter to you through the lens of what matter to them .,science
and and how that begin to shift the conversation not only because they feel seen but also because you are speaking their language .,science
not with the intent of convincing them .,science
no but to connect ?,science
to have a conversation and not fight .,science
and saying i understand that you value x ?,science
it tie back to the being seen and being heard ?,science
you listen to them and you understood them .,science
you understood this that is important to them .,science
and from that place you are attempting to connect with something that matter to you .,science
yeah i think that i think thats a big one .,science
these are all big .,science
they are not easy either because often the perspective the value based perspective is sometimes it is hard to try and figure out where someone else is coming from what could possibly how to put yourself in their shoe how to think in a way thats similar .,science
and i find that i think thats often a stumbling block .,science
do you find that people going through these method and work that youve been working with ?,science
do other people have this stumbling block ?,science
and have there been way to move past it ?,science
i think the first stumbling block is whether we want to engage or not .,science
especially because we feel threatened ?,science
we feel that how can i engage with this group that doesnt see me or that belief in policy that will disregard my group entirely .,science
and it is real .,science
when it come to politics it is real .,science
there are real consequence and it is hard because you are not only talking at the level of i am this group identity group and i want to connect with the other identity group .,science
and we are different people at the level of identity .,science
i think when it come to politics and policy that end up impacting our life it is more complex .,science
the idea is that the more that we do this and again if you are in a position to want to do it where you are not being disrespected where your sense of being identity is not at stake you are not being dehumanized ?,science
and you are not in harm way ?,science
a a matter of engaging in this conversation .,science
those are very important thing to include in that assessment ?,science
yeah for sure .,science
thats the motivation need to be .,science
and then the other thing i will say is it is not always about the long bridge ?,science
the long bridge of i am connecting with someone who is very different from me who also ha a political position very different from me and come from a very different part of the country from it ?,science
the longest bridge .,science
the idea is to maybe start with shorter bridge .,science
if you do not feel ready to go the long bridge all at once walk the long bridge all at once .,science
and and maybe this look engaging with a family member although those are easy either ?,science
but it is something that you are already close to .,science
close to you within a similar not equal but similar context lived experience someone who love you ?,science
and sometimes they can be candid but at least you have a lot of freedom .,science
yeah i think i think your comment having the motivation is important a because that is the basis .,science
having the energy having the situation and then having the motivation .,science
because we do not have the motivation then the bridge is going to be faulty .,science
it is going to break and fall down .,science
trust is going to be broken at some point .,science
yeah but we also find that motivation alone is not enough ?,science
there need to be skill and awareness of skill that you can bring in and and and latch onto in order to to be able to have real productive conversation .,science
and then the more you do it and the more you figure out that hey i listen and the wall came down and then they were listening and maybe we did not agree but we got to know each other better .,science
and the more you experience moment of of true connection the more you want to do it the more you understand that this this work .,science
and it may not work with everyone ?,science
and thats the other thing not everyone will want to bridge with you either .,science
and thats .,science
you you also have to know that .,science
but sometimes it is it is to walk away ?,science
to protect yourself .,science
it is to let it go entirely this is not work thats done by demand it is not we convert it to bridge builder and we will forever in every situation all the time have to build bridge .,science
no not even people who work with this stuff and have all the skill in the toolbox should do that .,science
it is not again work thats done by demand .,science
and if there is not openness on the other side and willingness to engage and if you feel at risk or threatened by a situation you walk away .,science
yeah ive had to walk away of situation that myself .,science
yeah i think it is knowing that you are that there are scientifically based tool that are they have been practiced and they are used there a a toolbox thats available that people can learn about and use and then apply if they have the situation .,science
if everything aligns correctly they can try .,science
and if you can try thats the first step .,science
and yeah and i to remind people that yes we are caught in these binary of you are this i am that .,science
but there are thing we share .,science
if nothing else using that a a starting point to seek to understand what is it that we might share despite our difference a a broader identity that might unite u that might allow u to step back from this group in group mentality .,science
and there a cool study around this with manchester united soccer team and soccer fan .,science
yeah we want to know .,science
thats thats thats high stake .,science
there violence that occurs at these soccer match at the football match ?,science
the team the fan other each other and there a lot of aggression .,science
yeah a lot of passion .,science
and emotion run high mentality to .,science
the study involved bringing these soccer fan together and having them think of the team manchester united and the win of manchester united and the passion and love for the team itself .,science
and then folk were sent across the parking lot and they encountered in some case someone who wa wearing manchester united shirt and other case someone who wa wearing a liverpool shirt the rival team .,science
yeah they repeated the experiment also with manchester united fan .,science
but instead of thinking of the team itself they were made to think of football fan in general .,science
and their identity a people who love or not football soccer in spanish football football their identity a soccer fan and what it meant to be with other soccer fan and shared experience around being a soccer fan etc .,science
and then again there wa a a a parking lot person in need sometimes manchester united jersey sometimes liverpool jersey .,science
and in that case it changed when they encountered the person in need they helped the person wearing the manchester united jersey a much a they helped the person wearing the rival team jersey .,science
yeah it wa the awareness and the appreciation of being in it together .,science
and this is a thing that we share .,science
and yeah thats beautiful .,science
and a david ha is saying in our chat now it sound a ted lasso episode to me which thank goodness for ted lasso .,science
that wa we all needed that one .,science
i love that .,science
narrow identity a a fan of a particular team versus broader identity .,science
and what that doe to u in term of spreading more kindness and being more generous to others with that minor prompting .,science
i want folk to know and understand that thats available to all of u minor prompting in our mind in our own life in the life of others it doesnt take much .,science
what unites u is their broader shared identity ?,science
we can go back to pea and carrot doesnt matter .,science
they are starchy vegetable .,science
we all eat starchy vegetable .,science
all the way from back to humanizing folk to finding something bigger that that what is that ?,science
i love that .,science
and i want to say thank you for this conversation and speaking with me for all this time .,science
it is been wonderful to hear all of these idea and the science behind them and the way that people can use them .,science
and i hope that our listener my listener our listener can take some of these thing and take them into the next week into thanksgiving into the next year .,science
and in the meantime would you people to go to the campaign for connection website ?,science
is this something that is ongoing that youd people to take a look at and try out ?,science
and what else can people do and where can they find you ?,science
thank you .,science
our campaign for connection launched and it is going to be going into the new year .,science
a soon a people sign up they will get seven day of skill to practice .,science
it is a skill a day in their inbox with tool and resource to support them a a an instagram group where people can join and comment or not instagram group instagram post where people can join and comment and connect with other shared experience .,science
and where people can go is there a tiny url .,science
tinyurl.com backslash number seven day with dcaps challenge with ccaps twenty four .,science
seven day challenge twenty four .,science
and i can share typing it out now and hopefully i typed it correctly .,science
and i can repeat it .,science
number seven dcaps for day ccaps for challenge twenty four .,science
it is a tiny url .,science
and if you check u out at instagram we are either at greater good mag which is the official greater good science center account .,science
and then we also created for bridging difference an account called at ggse bridging difference .,science
gg greater good s science center .,science
bridging difference .,science
got that one in the instagrams .,science
i can bring that one up .,science
yeah ive been trying to do these minute and a half video to invite people to practice the skill .,science
youll see youll see some of those here a in our instagram .,science
we are in day three going into day four .,science
but when you join you will have your your own personal experience where each day youll get a different skill .,science
you havent missed out on anything .,science
there are place that people can go .,science
there are thing that they can do .,science
this can be an ongoing effort .,science
and it can be a new effort or something that accentuates what theyve already been doing if they are working on this .,science
whats next for you ?,science
i know sleeping a lot after this election .,science
yeah no weve been busy getting out in the world .,science
i am very grateful for an amazing team and all of their support .,science
it is been a fantastic team effort .,science
yeah we have a statewide initiative in the state of colorado which is keeping me busy to turn colorado help make colorado a state where everyone feel they belong across all line of difference .,science
and thats exciting work in community .,science
thank you .,science
yeah it is hosted the denver foundation .,science
we are the implementation partner for this initiative .,science
and currently we are training fifteen organization and practitioner on the ground who are bringing folk together across the princess .,science
and their work is about to begin a two year cycle of implementation where we will also accompany them and technical assistance .,science
exciting to see how our work begin to spread in community and truly have an impact in people life .,science
we also have a lot of work that we do in the higher education space a part of our learning fellowship .,science
far weve trained and worked have the privilege of working with two hundred and fifty university across the country equipping them with some of the science space skill for bridging difference that they can implement it in their university and university white program and curriculum .,science
and we are going to do that too .,science
and obviously post october 7th last year there been much need at university across the country .,science
our work there ha only intensified and we continue to show up in these space where we may be needed .,science
but there a huge need .,science
and i i hope that the work in colorado go because i can see it becoming a model for other state if it is if it can be implemented over the next two year over in the different community with the different group that you are bringing together .,science
i i see this network building and community building a such a huge part of our social network ?,science
our social fabric and fixing all of those hole in the torn sock and a little bit of darning a opposed to a opposed to rending .,science
yeah i hope i hope it i hope it is i hope it go and i can not wait to hear how it go .,science
thank you .,science
yeah we are we are doing the best to document a a measure and evaluate each and every single one of the program that we can learn what is working what is not working and and continue iterating ?,science
we are this this work is ever growing and and it is exciting to apply the science to to these very real sometimes visceral scenario with in community with folk who are at it and and understand all the nuance of it .,science
the evaluation aspect that is science ?,science
it is the iteration it is also engineering ?,science
it is taking what you are learning bringing it back in evaluating going this is what we need to fix this is what we need to do how can we do it better ?,science
version two or this this version go out this way and this version go out that way .,science
different group need different version and you start to figure out how it work but we can not ever do that without the process thank you .,science
thats thats yeah yeah .,science
and i think well be moving more towards equipping folk who also want to do this work but do not necessarily have the tool yet .,science
thank you and if anyone ha a specific thought or question or if this move something in them and theyd to chat on the side please email me i am at juliana.taphor at berkeley.edu id love to hear from you and support you .,science
thank you much .,science
thank you for joining me it is been wonderful to speak with you .,science
likewise have a great night .,science
all everybody this is this week in science we have been having an amazing interview with juliana tafour from the greater good science center and i said i will be putting all the link from everything that she referenced in our show note to go on our website twist.org .,science
i think weve made it to the end of the show .,science
it happened yes we did it we made it to the end of the show i want to say thank you to all of you for joining u for another episode of twist .,science
thank you for being here and for enjoying the twissowine science and the good social connecting science .,science
ooh exciting time !,science
now i am going to say all the thing on next week we are going to be back with another show will there be cohosts ?,science
i do not know ill be here will i ?,science
probably it is going to be the first week of november .,science
hello everyone and welcome back yet again to another week here on the gsmc fantasy sport podcast brought to you a always by the gsmc sport network .,sport
i am your host a always christopher shepard .,sport
thank you all for tuning in yet again and to kick off the week we shall have a great show ahead of a great slate of segment for you starting off today .,sport
talking some monday night football an interesting game between the giant and the steelers will take place tonight and ive got you all covered from a betting perspective there .,sport
then a always we look to our nfl and college football .,sport
fantasy start the weekend the guy who impressed me the most over this past week .,sport
i begin at my positional ranking with my qb pick for week nine of the nfl season and conclude today show with my favorite segment my ever popular segment my bold fantasy prediction or my do not be surprised if you will segment .,sport
if you want to interact with show such a my show or others around the network a more directly consider making yourselves available to the super chat super thing and super sticker feature here on youtube .,sport
you can do one of two thing to interact with u here on youtube .,sport
you can press that dollar sign in your comment section leave a tip or donation or leave any burning question comment or concern you may have surrounding my show .,sport
you can do it for other podcasts a and it is greatly appreciated because we know that our show is going to make our show that much more better .,sport
but without further ado let u jump into our first segment of the day and let u talk some monday night football .,sport
there we go we might have to fix these little subtitle here a we go along but that is my mistake and we will have to go head on .,sport
but looking at this game especially from a betting perspective i feel it wa made more clear what with the steelers honing in on starting russell wilson .,sport
i feel if justin field were the starter for this game there may have been more question mark surrounding how this game would play out for pittsburgh but now i feel more confident that pittsburgh will be the winner of this game .,sport
the giant now on the other hand are an offense who are not looking that much appealing to nfl audience .,sport
i still think that if you are the giant you are not necessarily going to be in many more game such a this or have opportunity against many more team if this is what your offense looked .,sport
however i feel this game is going to be won or lost by both team for that matter on the defensive side of the football .,sport
i feel the steelers defense is one that now should still be an elite almost top five to ten unit but feel more middling in almost every statistical metric than in past year .,sport
i feel a large part of the giant success at least in the offensive end of thing will have to stem from the run game and not for nothing i do certain element of the giant run game .,sport
youngcath bossesports podcast and this week we are i think getting back in somewhat of a rhythm .,sport
we are changing it up in one way .,sport
we are doing a live stream but we are going to try and touch on all three sport .,sport
i think nothing is off limit dad .,sport
well try and give it a much structure a we can especially going forward .,sport
jumping into this new format will probably make some change and itll seem a little weird but a we go forward itll become more and more structure .,sport
how do this working out going forward ?,sport
now that the patriot have showed u they do not deserve a much time a we were given them .,sport
yeah we are going to go with something similar to what we used to do which is a show once a week where we touch on all the team except we are going to be live people can chime in comment question and .,sport
but today we are probably not going to touch on the patriot unless people insist on it .,sport
id to focus on the bruin and celtic .,sport
we gave them way too much love yesterday .,sport
we are not going to be doing a patriot pregame postgame show anymore .,sport
we are going to try to stick with monday night touching on all three team and best of given the celtic the love they deserve because they are the reigning champ and they are amazing .,sport
and then you get the bruin who off to a rough start but they are still loaded and they are still definitely good enough to win a championship .,sport
and they did everything they can to load up and win a championship .,sport
and we to focus on team in boston that go for championship .,sport
and now the celtic and bruin are the only one the red sox patriot are not exactly swinging for the fence .,sport
they are building for the future .,sport
all do we start with the bruin ?,sport
yeah let talk about the bruin because we are going to probably have to spend most of this later part in the celtic because again it is semi pregame ?,sport
let talk about the bruin ?,sport
matt pacha got an assist last night .,sport
he moving up a little bit in the lineup playing a bit of second line minute which we are super excited about .,sport
my buddy andrew bailey he talked about martian being a bit lackluster .,sport
and then a few minute later martian seal overtime for him .,sport
that wa a bit of a nice surprise seeing martian get on the scoreboard for a few game .,sport
dad this is almost repeat last year .,sport
and quickly ill touch on .,sport
i wa beyond happy at school today .,sport
i put the bruin flag up on my chalkboard .,sport
yeah and you are in toronto i am pretty sure .,sport
id imagine that wa a lot of drama .,sport
if you couldnt escape the wound a a least saying you walked into the first game a a self against the bruin you are losing overtime again you lost in overtime in game seven .,sport
it is fresh wound .,sport
there were many salty leaf fan .,sport
i got to break through one of these day telling you .,sport
every year the bruin hope to play leaf in the playoff .,sport
what are these day they are going to break through ?,sport
they are too talented .,sport
hopefully it doesnt happen anytime soon .,sport
but the bruin not to start a vision thats for sure .,sport
and i hate to say it but montgomery i feel ha to go .,sport
it is not working with him .,sport
and i would a coach to come in that ha some influence is not afraid to push back against nearly against sweeney .,sport
id an offensive guy he can look at these player in practice and go there not enough here offensively .,sport
i need some offensive talent because that is their biggest problem .,sport
i cried about this all last year before the playoff .,sport
the old bull wa .,sport
what ultimately doomed the bruin in the playoff wa their offense .,sport
it wasnt their goal ten .,sport
it wasnt their defense .,sport
both of those were excellent .,sport
i need an offensive guy to come in here and shake thing up saying no no no this dude is not a second line player .,sport
he going down there .,sport
who do you got for prospect ?,sport
give me the slice all kid .,sport
potra is way more talented than coyle offensively .,sport
let move him up because it is not working .,sport
this offense is bogged down .,sport
the defense ha been pretty bad .,sport
the goal ten ha been shaky .,sport
i am not worried about those though .,sport
they are too talented in those two department .,sport
by the end of the year i feel those will be locked up and perfectly fine .,sport
but again we need to see more offense .,sport
this team ha showed nothing yet to show that even though they added lin holm they are not quite there yet .,sport
yeah and i completely agree .,sport
i think one of the biggest telling and funny situation i saw with how bad our offense ha been is i wa looking at the box score or the game from the nhl coming up .,sport
and they have the star to watch for all the game .,sport
and you saw evangie malke and you saw connor mcdavey you saw mckinnon on there the forrest bird kid from nashville .,sport
can you guess dad who the star to watch wa for the boston bruin ?,sport
not against the leaf but the game before that .,sport
i think it wa against nashville .,sport
it wa it wa koki or whatever his name is our fourth line player because thats what espns ai is telling them is our standout guy .,sport
it is rough out there for a bruin fan when it come to trying to my buddy andrew and autumn they are huge bruin fan .,sport
and i wa you do not have to watch the bruin unless the fourth line is out there because thats where all the spark come from it seems .,sport
jeff i know and i agree with the old bull i will say though the bruin dominated the first and third period on saturday against that leaf team .,sport
and that maybe thats a spark game .,sport
thats a huge grudge match .,sport
you got to get up got to get up against the leaf .,sport
it is good to see the team show up and win it .,sport
we had to go to overtime .,sport
i wa hoping we could have closed it out .,sport
but that might be a turning point win dad .,sport
how do you feel about the win overall against the leaf at least that one game in a microcosm ?,sport
if it delay montgomery getting fired i am not crazy about it .,sport
but a lot of that the last two year thats plagued the bruin having a lead two minute left in the game and then they choke it away .,sport
again could use the coach and change there .,sport
montgomery ha been the coach for the last two year and thats been the biggest bruin problem besides the offense which is giving up lead in the last couple minute of game and period .,sport
and here it go rear and it ugly head again .,sport
toronto good .,sport
they are super offensive .,sport
they are super talented .,sport
but thats no excuse man .,sport
it is supposed to be hard to score a goal on you even if they have pulled the goalie knowing thats all they are trying to do .,sport
and you are setting up a barricade in front of the goal your own goal tender .,sport
it is supposed to be hard .,sport
and the bruin have an uncanny knack for giving up goal in that situation .,sport
it is terrible .,sport
we need a fresh start i feel .,sport
man the old goal is calling for a lot a lot of resume to be submitted in new england .,sport
thats mayo you won out and that is montgomery .,sport
dad one year ago could you believe that would be what you and i both agree on that joe missoula is by far and away the best coach in new england ?,sport
and i think it is not even a competition at this point .,sport
joe is the man .,sport
and my dad and i were ripping on joe last year .,sport
we had a bunch of problem but now it is monty and it is definitely mayo on the chopping block .,sport
and i completely agree .,sport
monty he wa supposed to come in be a young player coach helped develop those guy .,sport
i think petes the one who pointed that out .,sport
and monty ha not provided that for the bruin at all .,sport
lysos still down in providence .,sport
and pochera is deaf .,sport
i appreciate pochera being up but it took him long enough to move him up in line .,sport
and pochera still get frozen out some game and ha low minute compared to others .,sport
i am not ... and he play with stiff .,sport
and he play with stiff winger winger are no good .,sport
i am sick of seeing pochera with these winger that are not talented .,sport
when he still rotating lowrye in what the hell are you doing ?,sport
stop with that .,sport
he is not your sixth or seventh best defenseman .,sport
lowrye is way better than that .,sport
they are young player .,sport
they are going to make mistake .,sport
stop benching them the next game .,sport
let them get their damn confidence .,sport
it is ... i do not want you turning them into defensive robot who do nothing but back check and worry about their own end .,sport
let them take chance .,sport
let lowrye take a chance here and there .,sport
let pochers feel he can make offensive play .,sport
and if he doesnt get back and defend his own one hundred of the time i am going to be benched the next game .,sport
stop with that crap .,sport
they are not going to learn these young kid .,sport
it is infuriating .,sport
and theyve been doing this even before montgomery going way back to claude gillian .,sport
jeff i know i think thats the perfect segue into swamin. ?,sport
if you are paying eight million for that guy on the back end youve got to be able to take a chance here and there .,sport
and swamin ha to make up for those gap and those risk .,sport
and hopefully it pay off in some actual goal .,sport
how do you feel about swamin far dad with this contract ?,sport
do you think he put his money where his mouth is ?,sport
i know it is only a few game into the season .,sport
jeff unknown here .,sport
he definitely earning that big contract .,sport
most of the time he is not all the time though .,sport
you can tell he did not have a training camp .,sport
that is shown because there some goal sometimes you are wow swamin thats goal is not you .,sport
but he still make ten bell save here and there .,sport
he not at the level he wa .,sport
it is though .,sport
he ha all season to get there not worried about swamin .,sport
we saw what he doe in the biggest moment on the biggest stage in the stanley cup last year .,sport
singlehandedly almost took florida panther to game seven the best team in the world .,sport
he almost did that .,sport
and thats a good question jeff .,sport
i am talking to my butt saying replace montgomery because i do not have a replacement .,sport
all i know is i would an offensive guy brought in here what i wanted with the patriot .,sport
get me i am not worried about the defense .,sport
their defense is loaded with talent .,sport
they will figure it out by the end of the year .,sport
they are going to be awesome defensively when the playoff come around .,sport
i have no doubt about that .,sport
swamin is going to be awesome .,sport
fix the offense .,sport
when your second line ha two goal between coyle and martian in the last thirtysomething game that is terrible .,sport
that is broken .,sport
you can not have that .,sport
i know martian is old and he a step slower than he used to be but he not that bad .,sport
he not that bad where he should have two damn goal in his last thirty freaking game or something .,sport
three goal whatever it is .,sport
yeah with martian it is tough ?,sport
because weve heard a lot of rumbling about him with geeky being a bit of a diva with who he play in his line with .,sport
how much of this is you mentioned martian good but how much of it is this a mental thing with martian trying to shoehorn matchup and everything into his game ?,sport
and it is obviously not working .,sport
i am wondering if he the captain he should not be doing that .,sport
you are the captain .,sport
you are supposed to be another coach out there .,sport
you are supposed to be in line with your coach your head coach .,sport
and he should not be doing that .,sport
he should be being that drummer whatever coach say i am going to play with .,sport
ive read at least two report of martian wanting doe not want to play with the young guy that much .,sport
i do not know if thats why maybe monty took some time to get pautra into that second line because martian wanted his guy and then finally they moved pautra up .,sport
it is tough because not a lot of stuff come out .,sport
a lot of the hockey guy are very very beatty .,sport
the spit and chiclet guy suck .,sport
i feel the hockey coverage is almost worse than any sport when it come to these guy making these claim they are true .,sport
but if martian is forcing his guy in there and not letting the coach make the decision then i think martian a big problem .,sport
and i brought that up before the season started .,sport
i am wondering how much martian going to have a negative effect on the season .,sport
a he get older it feel he doing the opposite of the chara .,sport
it seems i do not know .,sport
i havent seen too much grace with this .,sport
thats whats frustrating for me .,sport
but martian should be on a line with pautras and lysol .,sport
those are the three most talented guy after the top three after linhom pasta and zaka .,sport
those are the next three guy .,sport
put them together and see if you freaking got something .,sport
it is ridiculous .,sport
but anyway thats our fifteen minute for them .,sport
let jump over to the celtic .,sport
and i will say one thing quick about the bruin .,sport
my dad one of my dad my dad had a very creative i think ten regarding the goal .,sport
yeah in a minute against the goal he go against .,sport
and thats not going too .,sport
the other thing my dad said wa that they were going to fall for the protection line again which would be linhom martian and pasha .,sport
and thats been making an appearance in those game .,sport
thats scary in that regard ?,sport
moving on to the any comment on that before we move on to the celtic ?,sport
no we have all the added touch on it but i am not roaring about the bruin unless some change do not come at some point we beat our head against the same wall .,sport
but anyway all celtic every night that they are on is an absolute pleasure .,sport
the biggest problem i have with this team is that they do not play every day .,sport
and i wish they did because i absolutely loved watching them .,sport
they are an absolute pleasure .,sport
and man big game tonight against the milwaukee buck .,sport
i do not know if i could check this without killing the stream but i am curious if yanis is in tonight .,sport
do that ?,sport
do that off top of your head if he playing real quick a you are looking at that ?,sport
jeff i know and i am predicting an exciting celtic win tonight .,sport
i do not think it will be a blowout .,sport
i think the buck will make u earn it .,sport
jeff do they are on the second night of an away back to back ?,sport
they had lost i think they played in brooklyn lost to brooklyn and now they are coming out to play against u and we are arrested .,sport
this is a very similar thing that my dad and i cried about .,sport
we cried a lot because they did this to u and the other side of it where we had a big tight game .,sport
i think it wa minnesota when it is overtime .,sport
in the next game we had to play facing milwaukee and away and away back to back .,sport
joe missoula pretty much benched his guy for the entire second half .,sport
thats why i think this game might be a blowout for that exact reason .,sport
yeah it is very simple .,sport
the buck are getting screwed tonight .,sport
thats all there is to it .,sport
buck are getting screwed one hundred .,sport
we cried about this last year .,sport
we want to see good prime time game .,sport
i want to see the celtic get tested .,sport
when tonight end up in a blowout which it is probably going to the celtic had their little trapped game against detroit the other day .,sport
they almost lost that one .,sport
probably looking ahead to milwaukee but here come milwaukee .,sport
playing a game last night traveling not far traveling do not get me wrong but it is still traveling .,sport
they are on the night of back to back .,sport
here we go again .,sport
it is the nba being stupid .,sport
you have a premium matchup this .,sport
why is it hard to make sure both team have the day off before ?,sport
matt what did you think of that detroit game the other day ?,sport
yeah the detroit game wa tough because we were still shooting .,sport
they were still shooting .,sport
i do not know if it is something where we werent running a lot of set and they were letting the guy play out there and joe wasnt getting too involved .,sport
i do not know if that wa a chess match to not show too much but this go back to the parody in the nba .,sport
i feel the nba is the best league now to watch in the world when it come to the amount of skill .,sport
no matter where the sucky team are they put on the court .,sport
and jaden ivy same thing .,sport
these guy are athletic .,sport
they are out there .,sport
they are running fast .,sport
they probably were thinking of milwaukee .,sport
everyone thought that game wa going to be over very quickly .,sport
i think the best part of that game is that it showed that a lot of the issue that we hoped were gone at the end of last year which seemed to be gone are carrying over into this year .,sport
they flipped the switch .,sport
are they a team that can flip the switch ?,sport
they flipped the switch at the end .,sport
tatum i think scored eight or ten of the last eighteen point for the celtic .,sport
and they said what tired of messing around and came through .,sport
it wa a weird game .,sport
it sucked that we even let them get close but it is almost a good thing to see them deal with adversity and come back and end up winning that game .,sport
sean raff .,sport
good to chime in in there .,sport
a little hit of symbol .,sport
the game the other night and this ha been a concern of mine .,sport
i havent brought up because they hadnt given u a reason to yet .,sport
the first two game the starter did not play the fourth quarter ?,sport
and thats amazing .,sport
we love that a fan especially the old bull and young cap .,sport
we preach load management all the time and it worked last year .,sport
that team went in and rested .,sport
they blew everyone out .,sport
never won past five game .,sport
thats what we want .,sport
my concern is there still nba player .,sport
they still their number ?,sport
and i can not help but wonder did they take a little bit off the gas when it come to defense to keep these game a little closer to make sure they get some fourth quarter minute to help there ?,sport
because none of them are going to get their point per game rebounding if they only play three quarter .,sport
thats natural .,sport
thats not going to happen .,sport
are they maybe giving only ninety on defense ?,sport
subliminally knowing that the play to fourth quarter keep this game a little closer than i am not necessarily saying they are saying that in their head but if we are being honest i do not know .,sport
do they and i felt the other night wa that celtic scored seventy point in the first half seventy something .,sport
and then over the next quarter and a half they scored twenty .,sport
and then you said matt they flipped the switch and they woke up .,sport
but it is what happened during that almost quarter and a half ?,sport
i felt they got away from what they normally do trying to turn off the defense a little bit .,sport
and i do not know they got their fourth quarter minute and point the other night but i am interested to see if there more evidence of that .,sport
i think you can not discount psycho joe ?,sport
there a good chance that this ive good chance .,sport
this is a a wet football situation with bill belichick where joe treated that game practice .,sport
there were a few time when the piston were going on run in that fourth quarter or a third quarter where i wa he going to call a timeout and they look to the bench and joes nope figure it out .,sport
i would not be shocked at if joe treated that game a practice a simulation ?,sport
what if i had no timeouts and this wa the playoff figure it out .,sport
and what a better opportunity than against the detroit piston team that it doesnt matter .,sport
you said when they are playing the long game they got to taste the championship .,sport
i to take and joe if anything he like to emulate successful coach .,sport
and thats something a successful coach would do .,sport
this is a learning opportunity for that team .,sport
and i know he love it .,sport
wow thats interesting .,sport
old bull is jeff jeff unknown .,sport
i would never say such a thing .,sport
i am hoping they are not doing that but it is possible .,sport
if i think i wa a player id be happy with the fourth quarter rest .,sport
he star that .,sport
they are number .,sport
jeff you never know .,sport
and i your take two matt .,sport
i thats it .,sport
maybe maybe missoula did manipulate that to keep it close in some way .,sport
and because they had not been challenged at first two game thats for sure .,sport
they were practice those first two game .,sport
it wa nothing there .,sport
i wouldnt put it past cycle joe .,sport
you never know .,sport
we got to get jeff unknown back on the show for a guest appearance .,sport
did we do that once ?,sport
and we are good .,sport
we are going to it is a matter of not making a janky .,sport
my dad mentioned that the start of the last the pope the post game my life is upside down now .,sport
now that ive moved a you can see i am making dinner for my kid a i am trying to do this thing .,sport
joe jeff once we can get a little bit better structure around this thing we are definitely going to have you on especially talk about all this stuff .,sport
and i think is whats today the sport sport equinox this is the one of one of the day of a year where we have every single sport at the same time or something that .,sport
no that would be tomorrow i believe tomorrow would be thursday .,sport
there no nfl .,sport
wait wait wait no what is today ?,sport
there is .,sport
yeah everythings going on today .,sport
it is exciting stuff .,sport
i am happy to talk about a lot of this stuff .,sport
it is it is it is funny because i do not want the dodger or the yankee to what i know we are not going to talk about baseball but a lot of talk about in our world now .,sport
yep i love that .,sport
had a lot of fun .,sport
very honored .,sport
and we were honored to have you jeff unknown .,sport
we are honored to talk to you every time and super thankful for you taking time out of your day .,sport
we will we will definitely get you on maybe next monday jeff if you are available .,sport
dad you shouldnt have called me to ask if i wa available .,sport
you should have called jeff to figure out what these he he available because i know pretty much ?,sport
but i want to i want to itch another scratch that i can not stand again .,sport
the first three game tatum get player of the week .,sport
thank you nba for recognizing him but you turn on first take get up the colin cowichan .,sport
nothing nothing on the celtic picking up where they left off tatum .,sport
there wa a little bit when they destroyed the knicks on that open and night but man nothing since then .,sport
and it is probably not going to be anything because now now the narrative is yeah the celtic they are loaded to well see them in the playoff well see if they stay healthy and no one want to talk about them .,sport
it is but well talk about a guy who ha no business being in the nba he only there because it wa father .,sport
and well talk about that .,sport
we are going to keep talking about the lake is thats annoying .,sport
the lakers are off to this start this three and start because a bronze playing heavy minute and it is have fun now guy .,sport
lake is they are playing they are doing what the bruin do .,sport
they are treating regular season game playoff game .,sport
thats what the lakers are doing now .,sport
hey what probably be a top three seed you keep that up all year and guess who going to have no gas in a tank when the playoff roll around ?,sport
and ad ad is getting up there too now .,sport
probably time is undefeated .,sport
that is for sure .,sport
and the bronze going to it is going to catch up to him .,sport
it is got to be this year ?,sport
no absolutely .,sport
and another thing is being the best player on the team with the best record in the nba is no longer what it used to be .,sport
that used to be the first guy who would get all the attention .,sport
no this guy the best player on the best team .,sport
he get who can catch him for the mvp ?,sport
thats usually what it is .,sport
those day are over now .,sport
it is about flash .,sport
it is about number .,sport
he he putting up more assist .,sport
thats thatll help .,sport
he always a high rebound guy anyway high point guy .,sport
the assist will help be a more of a defensive impact player he ha been will help .,sport
but ultimately when you are sitting half your fourth quarter you are not going to get mvp because it is number based unfortunately .,sport
and i think this go all the way back to bill russell .,sport
i saw this picture of the mvp race in one year when it wa when it wa bill russell will chamberlain oscar robinson ?,sport
and bill russell won the mvp and he averaged twenty three rebound per game sixteen point and many block .,sport
then you got and he wa at forty six minute a game .,sport
then you had will chamberlain averaging fifty point a game thirty rebound and forty eight minute more than forty eight minute .,sport
and bill russell won because bill russell wa the best player on the best team he wa the most valuable piece on the most valuable team in the league .,sport
and again that you said it is about click nowadays .,sport
and even though we are in the biggest market in all of sport it is still not enough because la is driving it .,sport
and man there wa the nba league pas i saw this other thing .,sport
they had a game update and an article on every single game that happened on saturday but they did not have the celtic .,sport
the first game wa the lakers and sacramento .,sport
after that they had every other game but they did not even they did not even make a poster a comment about the celtic piston .,sport
it is born now .,sport
the celtic are the best and they are the ball .,sport
and dad would you would you have it any other way ?,sport
whats up jason ?,sport
whats up man ?,sport
jonathan whats up ?,sport
whats up lap ?,sport
yeah jonathan my bad jonathan .,sport
hey i am yeah jonathan .,sport
one of my old favorite from the jail .,sport
absolutely awesome guy many of those guy up there .,sport
i always appreciate you jumping in there john .,sport
and yeah we got a good one tonight hopefully .,sport
look giannis is playing .,sport
he only went out a crusty old man middleton .,sport
street clothes middleton .,sport
well see if the box have anything left in a tank after playing last night .,sport
hopefully he get back in this week .,sport
that should have been his first .,sport
he got robbed of his first win .,sport
that would have been a blowout yesterday .,sport
he wa already carving up the jet .,sport
thats a shame .,sport
that game definitely not that close that drake may play the whole thing .,sport
thats the damn sure .,sport
and i think drake may commented he posted the instagram how about the boy or how about my fella or whatever .,sport
drake may nice little leadership nod there not being sour graf about getting taken out of the game .,sport
and i think john drake may is one hundred legit .,sport
he put up dan reno number in those first two game .,sport
i know i have said it six time in this podcast .,sport
i am going to keep saying it because it wa joy to watch especially after what weve done been dealing with .,sport
i am hoping his head injury is not a bad a it seems .,sport
my dad sent me an article today .,sport
mayo had some comment on it which i am not one hundred sure how much i mayo talking nowadays because it seems he give a lot of bad information and it is no information is better than bad information jirad .,sport
you are not being forced to say anything .,sport
you do not have to be weird but it seems he can not help himself .,sport
hopefully we hear from mayo .,sport
if mayo is telling the truth it is good news .,sport
it is because on the post game i said this is my hope is the nfl saw it .,sport
and because of all the heat they took from tua the nfl is no no no get him in the blue tent .,sport
and what my hope wa i am fine .,sport
he trying everything he can to get back up .,sport
there guy we are fine i am fine i am fine but the concussion protocol people would not pas them .,sport
and thats what i am hoping happened .,sport
and thats what jirad mayo said happened .,sport
if you go back and read the press conference today .,sport
hopefully he telling the truth on this one .,sport
matt say he like to give out a lot of false info .,sport
lead the meter on or contradicts himself later on .,sport
hopefully thats the case .,sport
and hopefully we see him back on the field this week for for another game where he develops and get more growth .,sport
yeah but yeah thats it for the show .,sport
we get the game coming on .,sport
yo bull is going to take off .,sport
i got thing i get to all go south and some thank you everyone for tuning in .,sport

some cheese to beat the raider ?,sport
yeah obviously i last time i checked wa twenty seven to twenty .,sport
all back to back loss each shit .,sport

i am keeping honest with you .,sport
i do not know lion next week no no not against the line again fuck if they do not have love but this is in my opinion it is the second best team behind the line .,sport
i am very strong line believer a i that .,sport
i the path .,sport
by the way because i am a lion believer doesnt mean i do not think the packer are good i think they are great .,sport
i think they are a little bit young on season and this jordan love how long doe it groin last doe anyone know ?,sport
i can not we can not calm injury prone .,sport
it is his first year but it is i do not the fact that not because he not bad .,sport
it is that he not good it is that i do not he getting it every time he get into a rhythm he get injured and that that thatll fuck up your yeah fuck up the exactly listen packer are a good team coach .,sport
it is awesome coach wish i had a coach that awesome coach jaguar bro fucking trash bro .,sport
but by the way brian i will say this brian .,sport
i love brian thomas jr. is great no he not no he not better than malik but he he he i guess you could say he playing better than marvin but he top three .,sport
he top three for sure .,sport
he top three ill say he playing better than roman doomsday .,sport
ill say that i wa definitely i do not know what the hell going on there i do not think any of u were high on room yeah falcon beat the buck thirty one twenty six .,sport
i am honestly shocked by this .,sport
i am shocked shout the baker for cooking you feel me without mike evans or chris .,sport
he still cooked up .,sport
ill see all your thought here the thing with baker bro and we played and we did not talk about the buck and raven because it wa monday night game it but here the thing .,sport
this is what i could say about baker too many interception turn to that he good .,sport
it wa three pick you can not play that .,sport
they are not doing anything with who our top receiver now without them it is it is you take away t higgins and jamar chaser the what is broke all ?,sport
we are gon na get to that .,sport
yeah we are gon na get that but imagine if he did not have those people you can not ask baker to the throat of fucking trey tucker or some shit that .,sport
fuck that is josh palmer some shit .,sport
i know shout out to baker but the they got much ever i forgot about that watch those do not shepherd but you can agree though .,sport
they are season old effect .,sport
yeah i think evans out for a lot of week yeah they are season about done .,sport
guy you have to understand something this is baltimore .,sport
all we do not have bad defense in baltimore .,sport
they doesnt exist the fact that i am witnessing hot garbage for the first time in my life is something i have never ever witnessed listen wa this game wasnt good for either side of the ball rashad bait me .,sport
yeah yeah yeah when he threw it to our db you saw i am you do not watch the game ?,sport
no i couldnt i only watched the last quarter .,sport
all . . you watch the last quarter ?,sport
did kyle hamilton drop that pig bro ?,sport
if he caught that pig what would happen ?,sport
i do not think ive ever seen this in baltimore .,sport
no me comparing lamar jackson the pay manning wa a very insult to a lot of lamar jackson fan in my comment section that wa a comp .,sport
i have a very nice video coming out about the ?,sport
that wa a compliment bro you are gon na see in my video tomorrow i do not know if it is they were lamar fan who who said they were pissed off that wa comparing him to a pay manning i do not know .,sport
i do not know why if we are listen a now a a now first of all it is not paint a lot of people can consider pay manning a top three quarterback of all time i do not get it .,sport
is what it is line blow out the tie into who shocked ?,sport
the line it is not it is not listen .,sport
it is only impressive because they scored fifty .,sport
thats about it the point no one care about the titan .,sport
they are fucking garbage but i will say this the line offensive play calling in term of having fuck the offensive trickery that they do you have linemen throwing touchdown it is it is weird .,sport
i said this team will take a step back and we can see ceo this is not the same team from last year cj stroud is not playing at an mvp level and ever since nikols went down cjs admit but let be for yeah .,sport
thats a fact it is a fact texan are a good team but i do not see them doing anything in the playoff i want to see no they are probably gon na get bounced by baltimore .,sport
yeah and listen i am gon na say this apart from stroud looking mid cuz he ever since nico went down .,sport
he is looking better thats not a good sign by the way .,sport
and by the way he ha dig and ting dell out there but do not show up there too a . no no yeah i agree with you but he doe it is not he ha lack of weapon ?,sport
he ha weapon up and and we seen quarterback before because cjs always up there and the top five for a lot of people you seen lamar you seen alan people work without without people dig my home last use yeah my home .,sport
yeah my home ha i can not say joshs yet how we still put up number today without evans and chris yeah listen i am not we are not saying he bad trash .,sport
i do not want people to think that but i think this is why we say pump the brake a little bit when it came to his rookie year we said that a far a the colt brought anthony richardson look fucking trash .,sport
yeah this dude is bad super bad it is not even it is not even i am cold bro .,sport
why the fuck did you take him ?,sport
he could have been something good if he wouldnt went to a team and sat but instead the colt had a fucking take him and anything the colt take that the fucking room .,sport
ill i pay an angel luck is what is there ? ?,sport
yes ceo philadelphia thirty seven bingle seventeen .,sport
man this is a good sunday .,sport
yeah very good fucking sunday and i have and i have a video about the bingle i am gon na let ceo take a ceo need to be in cheerful spirit i am gon na let him take a dump all over the bingle .,sport
ill say this feeling impressive win and i think me and ceo both picked the bingle but going second role game thats another blowout impressive win but ceo can this finally confirm joe borough is not a top five quarterback he not you you got to take him out .,sport
see you you have to let see against and your march ace i wa rooting for the eagle obviously because they are playing a division rival yeah but i what i want to say this it is a lot of people ?,sport
they are not a good team this is why i do not want people to think my god joe bro joe borough slurping and weve said it or yeah i had them finishing in the beginning in our prediction ?,sport
he he he alex smith with good weapon thats exactly who he is joe borough and i know all the people that love joe borough and this and that and still put them above people lamar or allen .,sport
you are stupid if you still think that bro i am not saying i still think bro is a topten quarterback .,sport
he had a he he an elite he an elite midperson late he top out at the mid bar ?,sport
he not he borderline good if that make sense ?,sport
yeah i agree thats where he is you can win with him but you are not going to he not in it he not a generational town .,sport
thats what i want to say .,sport
he not a generational town .,sport

you used to be a giant fan we are not even in the same conference .,sport
yeah but my thing is i am not delusional in term of i try to put my fandom aside when it come to analyzing sport ?,sport
yeah in my in my discord profile .,sport
what is my profile ?,sport
hashtag fire harbore and or did that change during the duration of the win for the five game win streak ?,sport
absolutely not me there for me .,sport
no i am very consistent when i see bullshit when i see fuckery at the coaching position and i see fuckery at the eagle coaching position do i think that hurt is a is a bum ?,sport
no i do not think he a bum but i want to see him without serrani i think serrani is still a bum .,sport
yeah i will agree with that because at least what her see there not denying .,sport
they the player came out and said it the serrani came out and said it jalen hurt is the leader in that locker room clearly the player him serrani need to go .,sport
i saw wa that whole coach that they need to go it is what is there ?,sport
it is speaking of go jet i do not know what the fuck going on here bro yall lost to the fucking drake may and jacobi brisette yeah blow it up blow it the fuck up devon bro i am sorry .,sport
why the fuck would you go to the jet ?,sport
yeah ive been said he dumb .,sport
you should have went to bro he could have listened .,sport
i do not know listen .,sport
first of all he doesnt want to win .,sport
thats plainly obvious .,sport
he want to hang out with his buddy yeah listen if i am a jet fan which thank god i am not if i wa a jet fan i am what ?,sport
i want to blow the shit up this is unacceptable .,sport
by the way .,sport
good job firing robert solid .,sport
he wa he wa definitely the issue there he wa the problem .,sport
he wa the problem no listen .,sport
listen the whole organization is trash .,sport
woody johnson a horrible owner what ?,sport
rj because woody johnson jerry jones and that he get and he decides the deal .,sport
he doe the trade and all that shit .,sport
i am not sure if you are aware of that i did not know that he he he not a famous a jerry ?,sport
he doesnt get the the press and the medium attention that jerry doe but he doe that .,sport
this is why they are trash woody johnson is garbage erin rogers is fucking mid at this point .,sport
he not good enough to overcome a bad organization rogers is in if you if i put kirk cousin here they would equally be a shitty yeah it is one of those situation where rogers need a good organization because he he himself is rogers is not a leader .,sport
he a dickheaded for being honest and he not good enough .,sport
this is not primary rogers .,sport
and by the way i the fact that you lost to the patriot that that is that is listen it is a divisional game ?,sport
he can be a bad head coach but he know how to coach his as off on defense yes and i know this ha nothing to do with the game and for some reason 49ers fan do not want robber solid back .,sport
i do not know why have you seen your defense ?,sport
are they still losing to that ?,sport
yeah it is ten to six .,sport
it is still the cowboy and that but still it is what it is patrots this doe nothing for you either way .,sport
i am assuming because they put jacobre set out there listen yeah yeah yeah what happened to drake made did he get injured or did he say i am assuming because jacobre set wa out there i do not see i wa barely paying attention to this game .,sport
i wa doing anything besides watching this game i had on my tv i wa probably laying down taking a nap why the fuck why i care about a jet or a patriot game ?,sport
it is what it is fuck both these team carnals and dolphin now carnals upset the dolphin twenty eight to twenty seven very exciting game .,sport
see all your thought all i wa rooting for the the carnals and i think i had them on the upset the week prior listen i what they are doing .,sport
i the i what they are doing in arizona they are overachieving yeah are they gon na do anything ?,sport
no no hell no but it is a nice story ?,sport
it is it is nice to see kyler murray who who unfortunately been dealt to a shit organization looked somewhat decent i said rj if he want to a good organization .,sport
i think hed be a lot better listen joe miami yo this fraud mcdaniels bad .,sport
get this bum off the team .,sport
maybe not waddle because waddle is young yeah i am jail and ramsey .,sport
i am moving him in a heartbeat .,sport
jalens got ta go shubs going where he most of the going rolling .,sport
yeah everythings for sale and if you want waddle you are willing to give me two first and we can probably talk about that everything is up for sale .,sport
i am blowing this shit wide the fuck open and i am getting me listen i am not a big fan .,sport
i am not the biggest fan of of shadore but they probably could be in a position where they could wrap him yeah it is not a bad move better than what they can do now .,sport
but you agree blow it up ?,sport
maverick ceo you might a call mic mcdonald see if he want to do the job .,sport
he should get pay .,sport
yeah thats .,sport
they are they are mid four and four whats gon na happen is they are gon na probably move off a gno after this here rightfully yeah thats about it until they get rid of gno .,sport
i do not want to hear .,sport
i do not want to talk about this team josh allan through his first pick .,sport
he not an mvp .,sport
go fuck yourself .,sport
now you can make an argument for jared golf but not allon .,sport
go fuck yourself .,sport
anyway this game is pretty much over with yeah once again charge beat the saint .,sport
i do not know if yah is in here .,sport
yah your boy rillers a fucking bomb he son .,sport
we have a general rule ?,sport
yeah we have a rule that we do not take rookie season that ?,sport
ill take rookie quarterback .,sport
thats unless they are un utterly garbage no no no no but we we generally stick to that rule yeah but this is the first exception .,sport
i think we made ever because rattler bad besides bragg show .,sport
yeah besides bragg show .,sport
yeah and there are exception where we break that rule when they are you said when they are fucking trash that it is undeniable that they are not a good quarterback ha he ha shown any flash at all ?,sport
rattler a third string quarterback .,sport
maybe maybe if you rj you can develop him into a third string quarterback .,sport
how about that ?,sport
bro i do not know if these clip but there they did a documentary on him when back in high school in college all he did wa shit on all of his teammate about how bad they were he not good he not good .,sport
he ha talent .,sport
he ha talent about time damn there we go .,sport
all whatever a very exciting game ceo commander beat bear eighteen to fifteen on a hail jalen jaden daniel see all your thought this wa an interesting game .,sport
obviously i guess battle of the rookie .,sport
honestly there not much you can get off this game it is too rookie organization .,sport
it is too rookie quarterback with two two trash head coach and two mid organization yeah and these defense are good .,sport
you put rookie behind them there not much to say about this .,sport
yeah that is true shes beat the raider .,sport
is anybody shocked shes feeling the soup bowl .,sport
it is what it is it is weird because the cheese are not destroying people .,sport
yeah but they win they do not care at this point .,sport
yeah they do not care .,sport
this is good .,sport
it is what it is .,sport
i still stand by her being traded i do not know if you guy have looked at the stats if you guy think fucking whats the name alex smith the game manager .,sport
no it wa in by the way it is not what i do not is i do not think herbers a bad quarterback .,sport
no i do not i do not think first of all yes he in a poverty organization and he surrounded by nothing .,sport
he surrounded by nobody .,sport
but he ha no weapon which is by the way ?,sport
who by the way would be winning my bet if we still had that going on yeah and by the way damn lad had one hundred and eleven yard today and two touchdown .,sport
i think off of that game alone .,sport
i would have won the bet listen yeah he not a good a people think he is thats my problem with him because we still have people arguing for the fact that this thing is a top five quarterback when he not .,sport
no he not and thats .,sport
he doesnt need to be a top five quarterback .,sport
he need to go to a good organization he should get traded .,sport
he should because obviously i think people people already hate greg roman people are calling for his job and i and by the way lamar won a super bowl with greg roman at the helm not super bowl my bad .,sport
he won an mvp with with bum as with bum as mile bokeh and a his number one receiver willy senead .,sport
you can not i can not make excuse for herbert .,sport
other than good luck .,sport
hopefully you do get traded that way you can win some shit because let be honest rj .,sport
whats his name ?,sport
harbaugh his style play boring and and not good for for it is outdated ?,sport
yeah it is outdated yeah it is what is there .,sport
and a we speak the 49ers are up thirteen thirteen to ten listen look i do not care who win this game dak and brock are beyond fucking horrible .,sport
these guy do not deserve the money that they are getting i do not see a bro .,sport
this is beyond ridiculous .,sport
first of all bop pretty fucking suck .,sport
my gosh absolutely brock is an out of good quarterback .,sport
and by the way and if he if they win this game which i think they probably will not it is because the nfc east is fucking trash yeah .,sport
apart from i guess the eagle who are i think a little bit of fool gold yeah apart from them .,sport
i there who else i am the commander are learning how to win the john are utterly horrible the the john are the john are fucking they are not an they are not an nfl organization either .,sport
it is what it is listen nine is if you do not listen i am expecting you to win this game because it is the cobblies and dak prescott is sorry at this point yeah speaking of that .,sport
he he sorry a too bro .,sport
he sorry .,sport
he now see who wa you put in the top ten hurt or dak if you had to choose one yeah i probably go with hurt off the simple because they both had weapon ?,sport
they both had some success .,sport
i would put hurt only because i can run him a full a fucking power bag .,sport
all but in that style where i can if if i can use his running the stack prescott run .,sport
yes but he not a i think an effective runner a a hurt is i would use him for that now .,sport
is he in term of passing .,sport
you threw it ?,sport
bro if i would have picked that get to put him on top .,sport
i wouldnt look a fucking clown .,sport
i jordan doe jordan have a a turnover issue a little bit but he way better he if he down he can come back that is not that quarterback .,sport
he can not come back .,sport
he suck jordan he when he throw a pick what he trying to hell take he a highrisk guy .,sport
yeah but it is with that .,sport
listen do you understand why ?,sport
listen a some people ask me why i do not football .,sport
i love the sport of football i hate the nfl and i think ceo said it last week baseball a a product on the field is supremely better than football especially the six club this product is bad .,sport
yeah argie because i do when it come to sport ?,sport
the i think we both agree that football is better .,sport
there no maybe the .,sport
see yo that game wa only two hour yeah baseball would be three to four with this pitch clock .,sport
i am done with it .,sport
and by the way speaking on the ref ?,sport
not only not only yet .,sport
they it change every year but at the same time it is they are they are they are only they are only employed half time yeah you are telling a bunch of parttime employee to go do a fulltime job yeah it is bullshit .,sport
stop with the turf .,sport
stop with the overseas shit stop with the ad stop overpaying these player brock perty and dak stop it yeah and who and give competent people to make the schedule please .,sport
yes stop adding game putting giant on the fucking prime time fact and then i think this week is a jet in texan .,sport
i am thursday night yeah who want to see that i do not want to see no jet yeah i wa speaking of that ceo steel and giant tomorrow who you got steelers brother fucking wipe in the clock with the giant and ceo .,sport
you are still not gon na do it bro can you read me off the stats at daniel jones and prime time ?,sport
i would love to hear those yeah you got a point .,sport
i think all the role game .,sport
speaking of i wa .,sport
i think we both have the texan ceo the jet are being superb they are cooked they suck they have maybe if they had robber sula i might call for an upset but this defense is fucking bad .,sport
also nathaniel hack it suck .,sport
i do not know why erin rodgers like this guy fucking much you have brice hall one of the best running back in the fucking league you do not use him at all to no you do not but even stay wait what ?,sport
thats exactly why the why erin rogers fired him .,sport
this is all rogers fault hold on .,sport
i wa a good coach but what w rober sula for one to fire this fucking bozo yeah absolutely .,sport
he wa on a farm thats a and erin rogers came in to save the day for him for his buddy but destroy the jet organization simultaneously .,sport
this is rogers fault yeah beyond stupid falcon cowboy .,sport
i do not fucking know you have you have kurt and then kurt junior all it is twenty to ten .,sport
apparently cowboy are cowboying .,sport
yeah yeah i am gon na go with the falcon i think honestly i think the better team and honestly let be real .,sport
at this point would you rather have kirk or dak ?,sport
ill take the titan patres will be here we beat them and did not have a letdown this week bro this is bad you are i am gon na go with the page .,sport
no no i do not want to go up it i am gon na go with the patriot but i am but i am i am begging the titan to to win i can destroy a certain fag in the discord what i am talking about .,sport
anyway this should my end in the one thousand and ten time raider bingle unfortunately i got the bingle winning especially losing this week i think they have a comeback in the red is fucking horrible .,sport
yeah bangle bangle are gon na win but they are cut either way .,sport
it is all good raven bronco obviously raven bronco nice story rookie quarterback .,sport
boy next look pretty good but obviously raven at home losing to the brown brown obviously this is a comeback win .,sport
i love you james but no sorry yeah i am gon na go charger .,sport
it wa the brown being the rate wa fluky .,sport
i am gon na go with the charger yeah saint panther saint .,sport
spencer riley might be bad but the same panther whole organization is probably even fucking worse .,sport
this is another first cowboy player with two interception and the three straight regular season game ninety two dach presscott thats not making seventy five million people .,sport
yo the fact that they still clown that defend them bro i do not know how you defend .,sport
hey listen my mccarthy suck but that is even fucking worse bro bro you have you have major cowboy youtube channel that still defend that thats how bad it is whatever it is what is dolphin bill bill you have a miami team .,sport
they could even win miami this week .,sport
you have a miami team coming to buffalo not great .,sport
i do think the game will be close because the bill game are always fucking close with miami but going bill hit there commander giant commander man i for some reason ceo dame jones always show up against the commander .,sport
come on .,sport
i am done with that bum i pulled never put faith on him i know bro but come on bro .,sport
he he he breaking that trend i put see you can not even this year against the washington only beat the giant by fuel goal .,sport
there the thing though .,sport
it is if they lose this monday it is bro .,sport
it is gon na be it is and then the the commander won an emotional game .,sport
it is i can definitely see a lot down here you are going with the giant everybody anybody who know me know i fucking hate the giant .,sport
i probably hate the giant more than any team in the league but fuck it .,sport
god this nigga that suck i know anyway jaguar .,sport
you want to the the eagle are facing a stretch of bad team .,sport
is there to filly obviously filly .,sport
yeah filly is definitely gon na win this but is it me or or they they havent the easiest schedule now they got a easy schedule .,sport
see ill give them that yeah thats an easy ask jaguar .,sport
anyway eagle you shouldnt be happy about this because it is probably mean you are gon na keep nick sarian yeah nick .,sport
i do not care what people say .,sport
yeah bear cardinal i get the carnals won but no they are on a two game winning streak .,sport
i feel if this is a letdown ceo .,sport
i have a feeling about that i am i am gon na go bear bear would be the the better choice here because the defense and but i ima go cardinal for a three for a three game winning streak yeah wouldnt shock me .,sport
ill i caleb but kyle is my boy but be safe .,sport
ima go bear ram seattle .,sport
this is a dome team going to green bay in in november .,sport

it is i am not even that interested in three hour .,sport
yeah apart from that game is there any game on that on the schedule that you were i want to watch it look at it yeah but it is .,sport
i rather falcon cowboy might be interesting .,sport
we ended up with the monday night buck chief chief this game would have been good if godwin and evans did not get injured yeah but yeah it is chief hand down yeah chief it is what it is .,sport

there is no question statement if you are asking u is that a good idea ?,sport
no because nick saving wa horrible in the nfl p caro i do not think he leaving seattle but p caros peaked himself and bill bellichick is overrated mean the old expounding upon that on multiple occasion .,sport
it bill bell check would become id id id be cool with bill bell check a the dc author he say the head coach the rave you are wilding .,sport
no a the dc .,sport
hed be nice listen bill bell check suck .,sport
yeah obviously scoring is part of the nfl but the nfl at it peak in the early 2000s late 90 had a balance of it .,sport
i do not see how storyline affect on the field product on the field product thats thats drama .,sport
thats nfl .,sport
but thats normal .,sport
you get that in every sport yeah and nfl product say there still defensive team .,sport
there no defense .,sport
name me one defensive team and i am gon na keep it real with the ceo .,sport
i do not think there are defensive team in the nfl i think the nfl product bad and these offense and these quarterback are bad that there little scoring game steelers how about that ?,sport
i said i think the quarterback are bad in that the product suck but it say i do not i do not know brandon can you elaborate on the whole story line out ?,sport
how is how are four story ?,sport
if colin if colin cowherd say something on a show and it is a stupid take i do not see how thats running on the field product look at the defensive team the jet used to be there .,sport
they suck the bear the bear they do not suck but they are mid in their rebuilding team raven suck yeah i came with the raven used to be good .,sport
now they suck bill they play dog shit team the cowboy suck the niner suck let le but but hit i do not get where you are coming from .,sport
i am in my opinion because notice nfl production .,sport
how are you ?,sport
i am not trying to the little bro .,sport
you but how are you bro ?,sport
opinion yeah that would make sense because if you guy have considerable age gap that would make a lot of sense yeah because i can i would assume that someone i do not know a little spongy probably doesnt understand where you are coming from .,sport
yeah those nfl production how he seventeen how whats how much seal how old will he be to even remember the no fly on the legion of boom ?,sport
what do you mean ?,sport
we six year old ?,sport
this wa a decade ago nfl production you do not understand how bad the product ha fold off within a ten year stretch and keep in mind nfl production back then the game wa soft to older people now .,sport
i do not even know if you call it .,sport
this is this this is flag football with helmet rj remember back in that era the 2013s 2014s and i remember back then even remember vontes perfect .,sport
yeah thanks he would even then he wa he wa too aggressive even then can you imagine something that that he couldnt even play he couldnt even step on the field yeah thanks .,sport
at least he had a job .,sport
he would it flagged .,sport
but at least he had a job .,sport
hell that two thousand and eighteen cowboy team with vanderes and jaylen smith .,sport
they used to lay motherfucker out and see this wa two thousand and eighteen .,sport
wa it six year ago ?,sport
yeah nfl production .,sport
you are in high school i think you are i think fucking whats his name random editor one thousand nine hundred and twenty he older than you the game is beyond horrible .,sport
there defensive team yeah they are not defensive team and i am keeping real with you .,sport
the defense is getting bailed out by how horrible the offense is seal you would think with all these team with the nfls telling defense you can not play defense in the quarterback .,sport
i received everybody getting paid .,sport
you think this this should be arena football it is not even thats my gosh my top defense all time number one still curtain two legion of boom three doomsday defense .,sport
see you are your master .,sport
you are offensive shit defense your defensive list is garbage .,sport
whats the doomsday defense ?,sport
i did not start on the scene until i wa fifteen going off of that you started understanding football what ?,sport
two thousand and twenty one this is what you grew up on yeah i can call it seal i think besides this cowboy in this cowboy is another game .,sport
i did not watch i did not sit down and watch any full time watching my full attention out on my phone .,sport
yeah it is not what it used to be but it is i do not know .,sport
do i it more than i do not know .,sport
it say i feel maybe i football more than you guy do that could be the nfl let make we are not much .,sport
we are talking about the nfl specifically .,sport
at this point it is it is anonymous with it because apart from the c cfb ?,sport
there is no other relevant league there no yeah listen yeah there is no relevant league and and by the way getting rid of gondola .,sport
yeah where it is a legit pas interference yeah or it is a legit tug or something where you could see where the why they would call it the the referee do not call it .,sport
theyd let it pas and then the fan bitch about it they bitch about no call too .,sport
they are in a position where i wa all we make the call you bitch we do not make the call .,sport
thats bullshit absolute bullshit .,sport
yeah it is not true horse shit my nigga horse shit and this yall remember when player bowled the fuck out in the pro bowl .,sport
i am be honest you i do not care whether they bowled the fuck out in pro or not .,sport
yeah great i did not they should get rid of the pro .,sport
why this morning ?,sport
yeah they should it is what is there a difference between brandons what two thousand and twenty one there a difference we can tell the difference see brandons maturity and me and cio maturity and we are at least three year older than him but yall are child .,sport
ill see you yeah it is true .,sport
we are gon na know even the nba started letting player play defense a little bit too id be watching the nick smack team with with leap what led pipe and baseball bat for twenty forty eight minute yeah that is a fact .,sport
it is the same thing no it is better here the thing obviously i do not the sport of baseball more .,sport
thats not happen .,sport
yeah with football the model that football ha in term of now they are fucking it up with the the game ?,sport
but before it wa a game on sunday the game are on sunday .,sport
there seven .,sport
there sixteen game every game fucking matter because there only fucking sixteen game yeah i it .,sport
what i am saying i feel sport would benefit a lot more basketball .,sport
it is shit we all do not tune into laughter fucking all star break .,sport
yeah thanks i feel the the fact that the nfl ha much let say the celtic play the nick in game one .,sport
all they they blew his shit but doe that game matter in the scheme of thing ?,sport
i can not do it many game i agree with that but here the thing though if basketball say they cut the season down to god forbid they cut the season down to seventeen game seal .,sport
i bet that first game to the last game you are watching every single celtic game if they cut down if if they cut it down yeah absolutely .,sport
it would be a fun obviously you can not because of the the way the nfl the sport is more physical than basketball ?,sport
yeah you can not you can not make you can not justify paying the basketball player the amount they get paid now and only have them pay let say seventeen game .,sport
you can not justify that .,sport
i will say this the nfl adding more game piss me off a too but if let say this if the mba could cut it down to fifty basketball game i think the product would improve hell even forty or forty can you imagine ? ?,sport
can you imagine if they had let say forty five basketball game ?,sport
i highly doubt it because that they are losing a lot of money .,sport
yeah they are losing .,sport
thats why they are watching and thats where i feel thats why i do not know is the nfl even fixable at this point because gambling is legal now and gambling always leaning towards offense in every sport but now in football it is shit .,sport
yeah thats thats what i am saying it is look look at what what brand ha said earlier on the same ?,sport
shit the cowboy suck as but i am happy that dad get garbage .,sport
thats gon na have to force the nfl if especially if it come down on rating and stuff which i do not know when that will happen thats gon na force it to be better .,sport
they are gon na be .,sport
it is what you are doing now is not working no no it is not but why would they be upset about it ?,sport
i am sorry yo guy nothing will be funnier then when ceo wa going at kaijus neck when he said woman do not violence it is thats one of the dumbest that it is bro .,sport
come on yes belief this is those are stupid .,sport
yeah they are stupid .,sport
but thats this is the fact and kaiju thats very sexist for you to call woman stupid and you are calling bitch too hey thats very misogynistic kaiju .,sport
it is two thousand and twenty four i jesus kaiju bro .,sport
i swear to god sometimes i swore if he related to michael in some way i do not know .,sport

no michael dumb who care equal equality kaiju did not you say woman are equal to men ?,sport
werent you you and ceo going on about this see arjun this is what i am being about .,sport
he said who care equal quality what the fuck doe that even mean ?,sport
i have no idea this is thats what do you use text to speech or something is half the statement you say kaiju doesnt a in human sense what kaiju even that you are wrong woman and men are not equal what what is he trying to say ?,sport
i am assuming he trying to say men and woman are equal they can do the same thing but we know for a fact thats not true .,sport

do you not know the difference between men and woman ?,sport
this is element human should work together a unity .,sport

here what id to highlight before we get started today .,sport
weird stuff happens in the halloween window .,sport
and we in october 27th are in the halloween window .,sport
we are definitely in it .,sport
it is scary scary week .,sport
it is a scary week .,sport
it is a scary week .,sport
i want what i want you guy to do maybe is you can watch the nfl game but hold your loved one tight because this one is a scary week .,sport
would you ?,sport
our first game .,sport
we got tampa bay and hold on one second here .,sport
let me scroll down here .,sport
now get to it .,sport
we got atlanta falcon at tampa bay buccaneer .,sport
falcon are giving one and a half point over under is forty six and a half .,sport
moneyline is negative one hundred and twenty two on the falcon and plus one hundred and two on the buccaneer .,sport
my god plus one hundred and two .,sport
let me explain to you something about this guy .,sport
this line opened because tampa bay offense is on crutch .,sport
godwins out .,sport
white is white even playing .,sport
they should call up tim tebow because thats what baker mayfield is going to have to do there in tampa .,sport
yeah. . it started it opened to give you guy an idea here .,sport
it opened at plus one hundred and seventy .,sport
and i understand thats a divisional game .,sport
i understand the bucs are going to fight hard .,sport
when i started looking at line it moved to plus one hundred and forty .,sport
then it moved to plus one hundred and ten .,sport
what do you have it at now greg ?,sport
plus one hundred and two .,sport
one hundred and two .,sport
one hundred and two .,sport
this is even money .,sport
yeah thats pretty much what you are saying even money .,sport
even the falcon on the road are even money with a bucs team that ha no chris godwin no mike evans .,sport
and no running back .,sport
buckeer he serviceable .,sport
he no whats his name ?,sport
rashad white .,sport
is that his name ?,sport
he serviceable but come on .,sport
how much of a falcon are healthy ?,sport
how much other cream go color worth ?,sport
i know thats what we are wearing today .,sport
look at the point .,sport
here the point where i am trying to make. . there a lot of line out there today .,sport
and we said it is scary and weird stuff happens .,sport
but the fact of the matter is that i believe and ive looked at all of them is that ninety of these line today are mispriced .,sport
remember we said last week we felt good about a lot of game .,sport
we felt good about some stuff .,sport
this week you are getting buzz sod .,sport
absolutely horror movie. . and the theme in this show will be do not get freddie freeman .,sport
thats what he is baby ?,sport
boy they picked that name pretty nice .,sport
the name is called nightmare .,sport
but this is a show about picking game .,sport
we will do our best for you .,sport
you mentioned quickly you used the word mispriced .,sport
tell everybody what you mean by mispriced .,sport
for the people thats not sure what you mean there .,sport
how did this line for tampa bay get bet down ninety point ?,sport
because nothing changed for them .,sport
besides they are wearing creamsicle colored jersey and they are at home .,sport
to be quite honest this is a tampa bay team that ride high and low on emotion .,sport
and if i found out evans and godwin were gone i know it is nose to the grindstone but i think id have a couple of beer all week .,sport
we are at home honey .,sport
send the kid with their babysitter .,sport
me and worfs have to sit down .,sport
yeah i am talking about mayfield .,sport
me and worfs got to sit down and have a couple of beer and figure this out .,sport
yeah. . i am and i do not know if that happened or not but the mispricing is the idea of a team being worth a certain point .,sport
a certain point value and then shaving you by fifty to seventy point .,sport
and it is every word of that .,sport
i am going to mention that time and time and time again because it is your money it is not theirs .,sport
and i got a little theory on this now. . all .,sport
you used the perfect word misprice this week .,sport
when your bet do not work out to where you can make money you can not do it .,sport
my theory here is in the last twenty year they are the first five week of this year football season .,sport
it ha been the worst betting time for the public .,sport
all the team that the public ha been on ha been loser .,sport
the worst the worst the worst in the last twenty year .,sport
nobody except for vega ha won money due to first five week .,sport
last two week now the public ha cleaned up almost every game ha hit for the last two week .,sport
the public ha cleaned up cleaned up vega the last two week .,sport
all your sport book everybody ha taken loss except for the public .,sport
my theory is since vega sport book ha taken a huge loss these last two week let recoup some of our money back this week .,sport
well throw them a bone or two .,sport
well give them back to them next week but this week we need to make some of our money back .,sport
i what ?,sport
you and i work separately .,sport
we talk throughout the week but we work on game separately .,sport
and the first thing when i came out with you is i went this this the whole week is mispriced and you went thats crazy that you even said that because we work separately .,sport
it is not we come up with this idea together and we give it to you guy .,sport
we are not in a production room .,sport
jack and i have a five minute talk before we hit live and we go live .,sport
we do this raw .,sport
what you hear what is all live reaction .,sport
there nothing rehearsed .,sport
we do not talk about what we are going to do .,sport
and greg said i still look up there in pennsylvania florida .,sport
thing we know player we know all the stuff .,sport
and i am i am telling you i am begging you to be careful this week .,sport
i am begging you you do not want to be cortez on a phone and ninety four month on our fastball .,sport
the raven the brown ?,sport
let talk about that game next .,sport
yeah i got a little thought on this game by the way .,sport
i thought you might .,sport
the raven are negative .,sport
they are giving seven and a half over and under is forty four and a half .,sport
three sixty raven brown are plus two eighty five .,sport
jack do you your raven here or seven and a half ?,sport
thats a lot .,sport
give me i want the money line on the brown again .,sport
money line on the brown is plus two eighty five .,sport
thats insane .,sport
yeah thats insane .,sport
that should be a plus four hundred spot .,sport
he say we should be good now .,sport
i know before we were lagging a little bit we should be good to go .,sport
course they are doing that to u bomb .,sport
stream yard .,sport
stream yard ha screwed u . but well find the best we can .,sport
we are the best. . let me get back to that .,sport
thats my price .,sport
i got that game .,sport
that game miss price too .,sport
the brown havent won anything .,sport
now theyve gone .,sport
are they going to a better quarterback ?,sport
we lost a wide receiver .,sport
hasnt done anything all year .,sport
and you got the map plus two seventy five you said .,sport
is that the price on it ?,sport
i wa able to bring it back up .,sport
it is that two eighty five .,sport
yeah two eighty five .,sport
that should be much higher for my dollar .,sport
it should be baltimore .,sport
i am smashing everybody .,sport
and by the way this is where you guy got to look at this too. . it is plus two eighty five .,sport
and yet the point that you are getting keep getting shaved .,sport
this started off at a nine and a half point spread .,sport
i wrote it down this morning .,sport
i have it circled now .,sport
i have plus eight circled which mean i the eight point .,sport
by the way now they are shaving you down to two seventy five or they are shaving you down to two seventy five and seven and a half .,sport
seven and a half .,sport
see what they are doing .,sport
do not let them do this to you .,sport
do not you dare let them do this is the perfect week .,sport
by the way if you a team if you a game to live bet hold your money on the side and wait for the market to be for you .,sport
i am i am going to when we finish this i am going to circle a couple of game and i am going to look at them .,sport
but the game went up to eight and a half .,sport
yeah thats what should be .,sport
yeah jump to a point and the money line went up to plus one back down .,sport
thats not hurt .,sport
i wanted that eight and a half bad .,sport
thats fine .,sport
they can give me those liar .,sport
you stay away from this .,sport
me personally i think i am going to be on the brown .,sport
i have a feeling it is up back up to eight .,sport
i have a feeling james is going to backdoor cover this .,sport
i i have we listen we always say do not go about your gut feeling go by the stats go by this go by that .,sport
this is one of those game that with the number and my gut everything to me is pointing that the brown are going to cover .,sport
i see james screwing them at the end of the game to covering covering u . can i ask you the worst ?,sport
the whats the not the worst defense in the league but whats the worst passing defense in the league ?,sport
i would have to say it is pretty bad .,sport
dallas is this pretty bad by by but by what you are saying it is going to be one of these two team .,sport
i know the raven doesnt have a good pas defense either .,sport
they are susceptible .,sport
i know humphreys is pretty decent but he commits a lot of penalties. . it is the baltimore raven and it is not because they lack talent .,sport
it is because that defense lack discipline .,sport
that should have been pretty easy ?,sport
but what mayfield did wa make sure he did not throw to godwin .,sport
and they scored the buccaneer scored twenty one point after losing evans .,sport
how i am going to tell you how the baltimore raven in their scheme got confused a couple of time and he hit wide open player .,sport
absolutely wide open player .,sport
yes they had some interception but let be honest the one interception .,sport
that wa a fantastic play by humphrey and humphreys been league for a little while .,sport
even baker alluded to he did not he shouldnt have thrown that ball. . james winston ha a live ball lady and gentleman that arm ha been warming up for week .,sport
he got but he doesnt have he been he going to play today with all the receiver he practice with .,sport
thats with the mari cooper .,sport
he did not practice with the number one .,sport
he practiced with the number two .,sport
and if anybody remembers james winston winston he is not afraid to sling it .,sport
hell throw in a triple coverage .,sport
he a monster .,sport
ill tell you what baltimore coming off of what they beat cincinnati and they beat tampa .,sport
it is going to be a trap game for them .,sport
this could very be a trap .,sport
you can absolutely .,sport
i love betting cleveland to win this game .,sport
i thought about taking the money line at plus three hundred and twenty .,sport
you could make some money .,sport
i the plus eight now .,sport
my listen i know we want to hurry up in place a bit .,sport
i sat there and i went i the home team .,sport
i the home team .,sport
i did that in every single game today .,sport
i the home team .,sport
i the home team .,sport
you guy could say it with me .,sport
i the home team .,sport
i the home .,sport
and then when i got to this game i went i do not know if i the home team because i am the public .,sport
do not be the public bet the team that or what what what team to take what game take the most gut to put your money on line today ?,sport
put it on there .,sport
go for it .,sport
he wa not he did not have that team looking good .,sport
whats the running joke about james winston ?,sport
desean watson hid behind closed door and did all of his misdeeds. . james winston walked up to the line stole crab leg and walked out in front of your face .,sport
that dude got .,sport
i am saying by the way there were donor there .,sport
they would have been hey james do you want some crab leg ?,sport
here have some crab leg .,sport
they are yours .,sport
he ha nothing to lose .,sport
why wouldnt he go out and sling it ?,sport
he ha nothing to lose this game except for possibly getting himself another contract next year .,sport
is behind closed door making ditty deal .,sport
he is .,sport
thats what he doing. . james winston steal your wife and girlfriend in front of you .,sport
come over here .,sport
no i this feel i talked myself into it .,sport
sometimes i could do this .,sport
i am taking cleveland. . all .,sport
i am taking cleveland with the point .,sport
i ill even take it with the seven and a half but i am loving to eight .,sport
i wish i wa on it more with the nine and a half .,sport
got jack said it opened that .,sport
maybe we should talk about baltimore a little bit .,sport
get these line down .,sport
guy i know they are listening .,sport
next on the docket we got the i could believe .,sport
i do not those .,sport
i am not going to bet that game but i think the buck will win today .,sport
i am not paying game on a price. . i am not full .,sport
you think that they have still have enough on offense to give it to the falcon .,sport
here what ill here what i want to say .,sport
the falt usually you split. . usually in division split .,sport
mm . . tampa bay looked fine after they lost evans .,sport
they still scored twenty one point ?,sport
scheme stayed the same .,sport
baker looked comfortable .,sport
the wide receiver that were there were backup did not get a lot of work with their hand throughout the whole week because obviously it is god one .,sport
let me talk through this ?,sport
i believe that tampa scheme is better than atlanta and let not pretend atlanta played last week because seattle walked up to that ringside event and punched them in the mouth .,sport
the bell did not even start .,sport
thats what happened .,sport
and atlanta they started looking around with hey do not they know where the falcon they did not care ?,sport
and i do think there is a weak softness to the falcon where where is in todd bowl could smile to your face and tell you you are benched .,sport
hey he filled through an interception three week ago and it wa one of his first and he looked at me .,sport
he go do you think that wa a good pas ?,sport
thats keep that up .,sport
yeah i think tampa even the series with atlanta .,sport
and i think they know it which is why this game got mispriced that. . i know .,sport
but yeah it is one of those game that yeah i am baffled when i know the injury on the box how it is only that to begin with plus one and a half .,sport
but i am going to tell you .,sport
this is not in this .,sport
let me talk you guy through this a little bit better ?,sport
liam cohen who the offensive coordinator for for the tampa buccaneer this is not his first rodeo with baker having no tool .,sport
they were at the ram together when it wa ben scoronic and a bunch of ups driver .,sport
yet they still mustered averaged a game two hundred and thirty five yard and two touchdown .,sport
he know how to get it .,sport
it is going to be it is going to be it is going to be bucky irving .,sport
it is going to be i think you are going to see rashad white maybe not play a lot of running back snap .,sport
maybe he play in slot a little bit. . i do think he going to get some time on the field .,sport
you are going to have sean tucker by the way fantastic walk on off of syracuse ?,sport
he a bowling .,sport
he maurice jones drew light. . bounce off the guy bowling ball ish ?,sport
you are going to see more play that .,sport
you are going to see you are going to see cade and and sterling shepard because mayfield know both of them very .,sport
there going to be choice route over the middle .,sport
i think this scheme that lee and cohen and baker mayfield put together can survive losing tremendous talent .,sport
thats what i am saying .,sport
all . . i get what you are saying .,sport
i i i am staying away from that game .,sport
that ha sucker written all over it .,sport
next we got the tennessee titan at the detroit lion .,sport
this is the largest spread of the week .,sport
tennessee is at plus five hundred money line .,sport
a lot of point man .,sport
a lot of point .,sport
i am going to make the i am going to build a bridge here ?,sport
and the way i am going to build a bridge is is baseball. . we are in the world series now .,sport
obviously everybody know thats the two best team in baseball .,sport
otherwise they wouldnt be here .,sport
and the bridge that i am building is to the tennessee titan because i watched a will levis interview and and i understand he ha looked bumpy in some spot this year but they sold his best receiver to kansa city .,sport
and i know he going to try and make the best of it but he know that they are seller .,sport
there no way the titan will win today .,sport
and by the way there no way but but i am this went up to twelve and a half now .,sport
because they are listening to u baby .,sport
thats how i feel .,sport
i do not think listen they are not even going to be televising this game in detroit .,sport
it is unwatchable .,sport
twelve and a half a lot .,sport
i am not touching the money line negative seven hundred .,sport
you can not thats can not make any money off .,sport
thats the best stash story i can give you there .,sport
it is it is baseball ?,sport
you guy learned something about baseball .,sport
if team selling their best asset it is time to start betting against that team .,sport
find them .,sport
find them ?,sport
for for argument sake let say the white sox were playing against the marlin and the white sox had a very very bad season .,sport
we but the marlin were i know but let say i am not thats not a white sock the hypothetical part is let say the marlin got rid of four player a couple of day before they were playing .,sport
i think thats a great spot to bet the white sox because youll get value .,sport
and maybe yes maybe that would have been win thirty four .,sport
thats the thing i am thinking here .,sport
they werent very good when d half wa there during that going to be they are even worse without himself .,sport
i the titan here too .,sport
twelve and a half is a lot for any team but detroit good .,sport
i find it hard to believe they wouldnt cover here .,sport
i am getting ready for thanksgiving in tennessee .,sport
thats what id be doing .,sport
this is a trap game i think here .,sport
this went down a half a point while we were talking .,sport
or let me get let me get through here real quick .,sport
negative three and a half .,sport
packer are giving three and a half over under is forty nine .,sport
moneyline is a negative one hundred and ninety two packer plus one hundred and sixty six jag .,sport
if this wa over in london id the jag .,sport
london is home field advantage for the jag for some reason .,sport
they keep it over .,sport
but unfortunately they are back at their real home in jacksonville .,sport
and they are going to turn into the regular jag that we have been seeing all year .,sport
i love the packer this game .,sport
i said this could be a trap game and it could be jag coming off of a nice win .,sport
packer coming back from a nice win .,sport
they had i forget who they played last week .,sport
i know it wa a tough .,sport
i remember it wa a tough game for them .,sport
this could be a trap game but i do the jag .,sport
this game did go down a half a point while we were talking .,sport
packer were at giving four .,sport
they are giving three and a half now .,sport
i it more at three and i do three and a half .,sport
if it drop to three be all over it .,sport
other than that i personally would to .,sport
i would to tease this game .,sport
and i want to tease this game with another game .,sport
that we will talk about later .,sport
well put a pin in that .,sport
put that up there for a tease for another team and well go over that on jack .,sport
who do you here jack ?,sport
the packer beat the texan .,sport
thats who it wa .,sport
thats who it wa .,sport
the texan .,sport
yeah that wa a nice hard fought win by them .,sport
one last second field goal correct ?,sport
yeah. . we do not even have to watch the super bowl this year ?,sport
the packer will be in it .,sport
and itll be the chief and itll be love my home ?,sport
and state and commercial everywhere .,sport
and except team get up these alternate jersey .,sport
and i do not think it is much the team .,sport
i think it is the owner are hey it is alternate jersey day .,sport
a lot of the game are at home .,sport
i believe that these alternate jersey are college football homecoming or whiteout game .,sport
. . doe that make any sense to anybody ?,sport
whiteout game .,sport
what they do is they proof a game for the team to win .,sport
thats what they do .,sport
regardless of the team coming in there and i understand that there all these game are not fixed .,sport
thats fine .,sport
you could you can eat those bag of chip but i am going to tell you now a thing progress official get moved into different game for different team .,sport
is not that correct greg ?,sport
you always hear about about rest being moved from here to here .,sport
one ref doesnt perform a certain way in this game .,sport
they are being moved off the next game to be replaced by another ref .,sport
all the time .,sport
and if you guy do not believe in that i want you to go talk to sam darn about that safety face mask .,sport
thats what id you to do .,sport
because that wa a home game for the ram .,sport
and by the way when minnesota started competing the flag started flying .,sport
i havent seen that much laundry in a laundromat on a sunday. . and it is because they were at home against the ram .,sport
and i know some of you guy do not to subscribe to that but it is true. . yeah .,sport
with that being said green bay wore their alternate jersey last week .,sport
and team coming off an alternate jersey win have a losing record .,sport
i that stat. . they have a losing record ?,sport
because everything that wa put into them being able to sell that jersey to fan wa put in that houston wa never going to win that game .,sport
by the way houston had alternate jersey night the week before did they win ?,sport
yeah they did .,sport
and then they lost .,sport
see what we are doing here .,sport
it is very important to know this .,sport
how do you that ?,sport
and i said this very very could end up being a trap game for for green bay .,sport
but all all all my logic point to green bay all your point make sense .,sport
our viewer have to they have to decide who they are going to go with .,sport
next week guy i want you to put in the comment .,sport
let u know who you went with with this game .,sport
i definitely be taking the packer this game .,sport
i do the packer here but i could see very easily how this could be a trap game and the jag could walk up .,sport
they could walk away with the win .,sport
those packer feel a ninety four mile an hour fastball .,sport
they are playing great ball .,sport
they are playing one of the best team the best team in nfc not one of the best team the best team in nfc .,sport
public owned by the way .,sport
is it a week to destroy the public ?,sport
it is .,sport
it is .,sport
it is .,sport
now to this game .,sport
this game .,sport
philadelphia eagle at the cincinnati bengal .,sport
eagle are getting two and a half over under forty seven and a half .,sport
eagle are at plus one hundred and twenty moneyline .,sport
bengal are at negative one hundred and forty two .,sport
a little bit about this game .,sport
eagle have not scored the only team in the nfl to that have not scored in the first quarter .,sport
eagle have not .,sport
cincinnati a bad a you want to say their defense is they do not give up the long play .,sport
a little food of thought there .,sport
those two little stats .,sport
because the eagle do they live off those long play .,sport
they live off of them .,sport
those long pass to aj brown devonte smith ?,sport
. . i believe in i think a lot of this could be live betting and trying to get your spot bet your spot this week ?,sport
we talk all the time .,sport
i do not love cincinnati two and a half .,sport
i did all week and then i went thats easy .,sport
thats easy .,sport
everyones going to be on that. . i think that that line should switch to the opposite side .,sport
it should be philly minus two and a half .,sport
this is the trick. . and you said i love that you said this because it wa it wa a light coming down in my room .,sport
you said philly hasnt scored a first quarter touchdown .,sport
here what i want you guy to do .,sport
i want you to wait for philly to score their first first quarter touchdown .,sport
see how we did that ?,sport
and then i want you to bet cincinnati bengal getting five and a half because thats whats going to happen .,sport
exactly whats going to happen .,sport
thats exactly whats going to happen .,sport
cincinnati is going to get five and a half after philly go up seven nothing. . you guy are going to get the value you deserve and the bengal are going to lose by three .,sport
all your friend will be throwing their tv in the street while you are collecting at the i think thats the way you play this .,sport
i it is a tough game to pick .,sport
it is it is tough point .,sport
if i am getting if i am getting five and a half with the bengal i am taking it all day .,sport
even still you have chase brown .,sport
they still have their pretty good tight end .,sport
who pretty athletic .,sport
i still them .,sport
it is not a favorite .,sport
no if they are getting five and a half .,sport
no i want point with them .,sport
i want point with them .,sport
you said it should be flip flop .,sport
i know i know vega doesnt say that it is this anymore .,sport
back in the day when you bet the home team pretty much vega always gave them a three point there off the bat your negative three .,sport
bengal are at home at two and a half negative .,sport
id say not the vega love the eagle .,sport
it is a little bit .,sport
it is they are they are someone telling you to jump in the water and vega is going a toe .,sport
put a toe in .,sport
a cold though .,sport
it look bluer than it is supposed to be .,sport
i do not see any steam in that water .,sport
say vega all over this with the eagle .,sport
if you guy want to bet with our with our theory this week you take the eagle .,sport
if you want to bet smart wait for the eagle to go up by seven .,sport
jack said hopefully they do get their first quarter touchdown go up by seven .,sport
it the point flip flop on you .,sport
i think thats a great bet .,sport
i would love it .,sport
and and it wa that statistic that you mentioned thats why we do this guy and he floated it out there and went what did you say ?,sport
mm . . and it is sometimes sometimes youll hear it from u . sometimes youll hear it on tv but that what did you say moment ?,sport
and once you get that feeling in your gut it is not breakfast that you need .,sport
it is the it is the money from your bank count to bet on the game is what you need .,sport
and then you put it back in your bank account and you get a bigger breakfast .,sport
there you go .,sport
what we are saying is wait on this game live .,sport
hold off .,sport
hold off on your money .,sport
see what see if see if this go the way that we said said doesnt do not touch it .,sport
you did not lose out on anything .,sport
therefore you are good .,sport
what we are saying is wait on this one .,sport
put it down .,sport
there you go .,sport
we got the colt over houston texas .,sport
yeah over in theapolis colt at houston texas .,sport
colt are at plus five over under is forty five colt are at plus one hundred and eighty five .,sport
texan are at negative two hundred and twenty five .,sport
whats that ?,sport
you did it again. . in the philly game you mentioned a fantastic stat .,sport
and then now what you did is is by accident you went colt over to texan and then you swan then you went back to what it wa .,sport
thats because i wa thinking i do the colt at plus five here .,sport
whats interesting is the colt always play the texan within three .,sport
i wa i wa going to say they play them tough every single time no matter who under center who on the team .,sport
yeah i i i do i the colt here .,sport
i think richardson look better and better and better .,sport
i houston got a good front line on defense but they make mistake in the secondary .,sport
and thats i keep saying it but it is all he know how to do .,sport
richardson can not move defense but he can throw it ninety yard .,sport
alec pierce one of the prop bet thats been heavy today ?,sport
on the on the farm guy is alec pierce will catch a twenty five yard pas .,sport
alec pierce is going to catch a bomb today .,sport
he catch bomb and and again thats what he good at .,sport
and and i i yeah give me indy with the point .,sport
i i yeah. . what wa that game that i said i liked to tease with ?,sport
now if you want the money line wa that the green bay game ?,sport
hold on .,sport
i drafting is timed out on me .,sport
i know you could take houston on the money line here though .,sport
i think houston going to win this game .,sport
that thats that wa my thing .,sport
i do houston this game but i what i would to do is do my tea .,sport
here we go with green bay. . and with houston .,sport
if anybody is new to this tease you take two or more team two to three .,sport
i do not know if they allow any more than three team .,sport
but you take at least two team for the game start .,sport
if a game start you can not tease .,sport
and then you get six point to your favor .,sport
if i am taking houston i would be getting a plus one point to my favor .,sport
and if you already think houston is going to win thats there .,sport
it is gold .,sport
and then green bay id to remember i said i green bay but i them more at three than i do three and a half .,sport
ill be getting two and a half here instead of giving three .,sport
ill be getting two and a half .,sport
thats what i will be doing .,sport
ill be take ill be teasing green bay and and detection .,sport
i wanted to throw that in there .,sport
i had a couple of tease built into this houston game .,sport
my point is i houston to win this game period since i already havent built into two tease that i am doing .,sport
normally i wouldnt do that .,sport
normally thats not all negative two hundred and twenty five .,sport
you are not making too much off of that .,sport
you are making maybe half of your money .,sport
thats not bad .,sport
it is not bad .,sport
it feel a lie though .,sport
whats that ?,sport
the five still feel a lie at a minus two hundred and twenty five .,sport
thats it is minus one hundred and seventy five bill in case you guy are wondering .,sport
for indie score the first touchdown two and then you can live bet that .,sport
a ten ten you are winning four and forty four cent on a ten bet .,sport
you are not even gaining half your money .,sport
look what they have done to u . you put fifty down you win seventwo hundred and twenty two .,sport
you are winning twenty two and twenty two cent .,sport
i to tease personally .,sport
thats what ill be doing .,sport
but anyways we both houston in this game .,sport
next game we got the jet at the patriot .,sport
jet are at negative two hundred and eighty or sorry two hundred and ninety five ninety eight on the money line .,sport
and patriot at plus two hundred and forty on the money line .,sport
seven a lot for a division game .,sport
yeah it is .,sport
and the patriot are quietly playing pretty good .,sport
he he not making the stupid decision .,sport
youd see how deficient they are a a team talent wise .,sport
but you said they are playing competitive football .,sport
i still win jet though .,sport
i do not the jet at seven though .,sport
here what you could do. . you could take you could take the jet on the money line .,sport
look at guy you are going to have to take chance today .,sport
i i do not i do not mean to say that but you are going to have to take chance .,sport
thats the way it is going to be .,sport
i think you could take the two team that have underperformed this year together .,sport
i think you could take the jet and the jaguar on the money line .,sport
i think you could .,sport
i think you could take the jet .,sport
yeah you could take the jet and then the jaguar getting three and a half .,sport
i think the jet if the jaguar lose today the laundry will fly in their favor .,sport
the most they lose by is three .,sport
they called trevor lawrence the prince and the golden child before he ha done anything .,sport
there a reason why folk and i do not care that and they do not care that sam darnold and all these other quarterback have quarterbacked better than him .,sport
then you take the jag with the point and take the jet with the money line .,sport
yeah i love that because because again evan ingram getting reincorporated into this offense ha been big for jacksonville .,sport
i thats who i would put together and feel comfortable with .,sport
the over in that game too .,sport
forty nine .,sport
i think a lot of point are going to be scored .,sport
fifty twoish .,sport
i think it get around there .,sport
yeah yeah absolutely .,sport
i the over in that game .,sport
jack gave you a nice little parlay there to do .,sport
neither one of u the patriot in this game .,sport
i said they are playing competitive football .,sport
could they cover this game ?,sport
yeah they could .,sport
i do not see it but they could .,sport
thats why you take the money line or tease it with another team .,sport
get six point towards your favor .,sport
yeah yeah we already yeah we already went over the what game ?,sport
what game would go over ?,sport
what about if you tease the jet and the buccaneer ?,sport
the jag and the buccaneer ?,sport
yeah no no the jet and the bucs .,sport
the jet you would be youd be giving one and the buccaneer youd be getting seven and a half .,sport
getting seven and a half .,sport
yeah the thing with that though it is you you said you the box .,sport
i know but that game either going to go the way i said or they get absolutely smoked out of the building .,sport
i personally this is what you do then take the take the take the jet tease it down to one and then the dolphin tease that down to where you are getting to .,sport
yeah you could do that .,sport
thats the next game we are at by the way .,sport
cardinal are at plus four over under forty six and a half .,sport
money line .,sport
cardinal are at plus one hundred and sixty four .,sport
dolphin are at negative one hundred and ninety eight .,sport
i love love love the dolphin here .,sport
i said this last week how much i the dolphin .,sport
i them more this week with tua back .,sport
i briefly told you before why i this team why i this game .,sport
but let me reiterate it is that tuas back .,sport
therefore mcdaniels and tua are going to have to turn the page over the most disastrous month this team had in a couple year .,sport
theyve been the worst team in the nfl probably for the last month .,sport
i hasnt been able to do nothing .,sport
i think mike mcdaniels is going to pull out all the stop on this game with tua back .,sport
every bag of trick that they have their back are against the wall .,sport
they do not win this game they are done .,sport
yeah i all that .,sport
obviously i said weird stuff happens in the halloween window .,sport
one of the most famous magician ever harry houdini died on halloween .,sport
people do not know that harry houdini used to have obviously he wa a locksmith and he did magic and stuff that .,sport
but in between road gig he wa able to he wa good at taking punch .,sport
he used to let people punch him in the stomach for money .,sport
and what happened is he let a kid punch him three time on that day and pay him .,sport
and it ruptured something in his stomach .,sport
and he died on the road .,sport
and i mentioned harry houdini in this halloween window because the greatest magician now is coming back .,sport
tua is not this magnificent talent. ?,sport
he not .,sport
but he run the mike mcdaniel magic the best .,sport
he the magician that play with the deck of card best. ?,sport
and now that he back you are going to see why it take certain quarterback to run that rock party .,sport
he not the most talented guy but he a good magician .,sport
is a good magician .,sport
he get the mechanic and he get the machine working the best .,sport
it is the same offense .,sport
exactly the same offense .,sport
and you almost want a guy to be a good magician but he doesnt have to be .,sport
the greatest athlete is not going to make the magic look a good .,sport
my one question here is a i think that i think tua it is not a question statement .,sport
tua is a better magician than justin herbert is a quarterback .,sport
and arizona i am saying that because because the charger had an opportunity to put arizona away last week justin herbert couldnt find five yard .,sport
i think he ha a little bit .,sport
follow me because you got the same coach too .,sport
i think he got a little bit of a kaepernick problem .,sport
i know you guy hate him but kaepernick wa good for fifteen to twenty five yard .,sport
rocket dead on five yard .,sport
i am going over their head going into the ground .,sport
i remember all of it .,sport
justin herbert reminds me much of him .,sport
there no touch on the ball .,sport
certain quarterback ha that touch .,sport
they might not have the strongest arm in the world or anything that but they have touch on the ball .,sport
and sometimes thats all you need .,sport
you do not need that ninety five mile an hour fastball .,sport
he threw it six yard past palmer last week and all they needed wa a couple yard and he hardbought went nut for a pas to ference .,sport
the fact of the matter is the pas wa embarrassing .,sport
and with all that information thats where i am leaning with you .,sport
the magician is back .,sport
yeah and they havent put together backtoback good week all year .,sport
even back they came and put together backtoback good half .,sport
one half they play good the next half they do not let it know backtoback game .,sport
since the arizona did win last week and miami back is up against the wall you said two of the magician is back .,sport
yeah everything to me point that the dolphin are going to win this .,sport
coming off of a short week .,sport
getting to miami early because we want to get to miami early but the problem with getting to miami early is those club are open late .,sport
i wa going to say there a lot more to do .,sport
thats man .,sport
this is in arizona where everybody go to applebees and hang out .,sport
everyones to sean watson in miami .,sport
thats our one oclock slate guy .,sport
we are on to our four oclock game .,sport
this game here i think is interesting .,sport
buffalo bill at seattle seahawks .,sport
bill are at negative three over under forty five .,sport
bill are at negative one hundred and sixty two .,sport
moneyline seattle at plus one hundred and thirty six .,sport
everything point that the bill should run away with this .,sport
do not understand why .,sport
but unfortunately if anybody ha watched the bill this year they have beaten up on bad team and barely squeaked high against good team .,sport
josh allen ha not thrown a pick yet this year either .,sport
he ha not thrown a pick .,sport
thats true .,sport
but there only been one quarterback in the past ten year to have a nine for thirty stat line .,sport
now is it josh allen or is it geno smith ?,sport
because most people answered and said geno smith .,sport
and theyd be wrong .,sport
the answer is josh allen .,sport
nine for thirty .,sport
and they went out and found him a number one wide receiver after that because stefan diggs barked online and said josh doe need a number one .,sport
and it is true .,sport
by the way he hasnt thrown any interception because he hasnt taken any chance because there no receiver that he belief to take a chance with .,sport
now i understand that he got a mari cooper but the seattle secondary is good .,sport
they are real .,sport
yeah they are .,sport
they are very good .,sport
i think the bet that you can make on this game are josh allen throw an interception. . i think he think he ha one on one with keon coleman .,sport
he over the top get his first interception but it is good news because he get that one on the way .,sport
sometimes it is good to get one on your way .,sport
i think this game is real real tight .,sport
gino smith a good quarterback .,sport
i do not want to touch this game .,sport
yeah i am not touching it myself .,sport
i think i think seattle is going to get a strong dose of james cook .,sport
buffalo is smart because thats the one thing you can do against seattle .,sport
you can run on them .,sport
yeah seattle best and is ed oliver playing today ?,sport
yeah i do not know .,sport
that could be a huge thing too because walker could run all over end up running all over that defense .,sport
itll be embarrassing .,sport
yeah metcalfe had a great game last week .,sport
there is no very could be going to seattle way .,sport
it is in seattle .,sport
there is no metcalfe this game .,sport
there is .,sport
is it ?,sport
no metcalfe this week .,sport
i buffalo a little bit more than i think i buffalo a little bit more .,sport
again all thing equaled buffalo go up to seattle .,sport
it look impressive .,sport
but understand no metcalfe when you guy make that bet .,sport
again i am not touching this .,sport
this is a game .,sport
if i had to lean one way id be leaning towards buffalo .,sport
metcalfe is a big big big missing piece for that offense .,sport
if seattle .,sport
i want to say this too .,sport
after this week you do not have to keep jackson smith nijigba on your fantasy team ever again .,sport
he not a number one .,sport
no he wasnt drafted to be a number one .,sport
but espn keep lying to people and ranking his statistic high .,sport
he hasnt hit the benchmark once .,sport
jackson smith nijigba ha the same projected point over the past couple week a george pickens and george pickens ha had me with better leg throwing him the ball .,sport
what are you guy crazy ?,sport
jackson smith nijigba ha never dominated a game once .,sport
what are we doing ?,sport
yeah i get it .,sport
i looked at them too much because i wa never i never wanted to have a i did myself .,sport
there wa never there wa never a need to have them on my team .,sport
hey you can rent .,sport
you are here .,sport
you are here .,sport
we are all going to listen .,sport
it is a can not take it .,sport
i will not take it .,sport
neither one of u like this game at all .,sport
we are both leaning towards buffalo .,sport
it sound .,sport
next we got the saint a a charger .,sport
saint are at plus seven over under is forty one .,sport
saint are at plus two hundred and sixty money line .,sport
charger are at negative three hundred and twenty five money line .,sport
thought here .,sport
this is one of those mispriced guy .,sport
it is .,sport
it is .,sport
i look at i know that this the first of all this is insane. . the saint got blown out .,sport
the charger lost .,sport
the charger did not look great in that loss .,sport
let not they did not a couple overthrow couple flag they started shot to win that game .,sport
no they shot a shot .,sport
they could have won that .,sport
but the saint got absolutely smashed in all facet of the game. . and it is only minus seven because they do not think the charger can pull away from anybody .,sport
and but it is three hundred and fifty or three hundred and twenty five now money line wa three hundred and fifty when i wrote it .,sport
i it feel i am not putting all my money on the line to make a hundred buck .,sport
i do not mind putting money out there but this should be two hundred and sixty five .,sport
i am barking at the odds maker because they know i am .,sport
therell be somebody knocking at my door in twenty minute all of a bullet in my head .,sport
i do not care because i told you guy the truth .,sport
mm. . i can rest on my laurel head to my casket knowing that i told you guy that this should be a two hundred and sixty five and do not bet it .,sport
let them keep their money .,sport
another miss priced misrepresented .,sport
do not throw a ninety four mile an hour fastball that i am still on that .,sport
do not throw a ninety down the plate to a major league professional .,sport
these are major league professional by the way major league vega line guy .,sport
they will take your money .,sport
they will have you living outside and getting divorced .,sport
thatll thats whatll happen .,sport
i am i am this is one of those game .,sport
miss priced .,sport
all the one that are mispriced leave them .,sport
i do not too many point here .,sport
this is a game that i would take the money line in a parlay somewhere .,sport
thats about it .,sport
thats about it .,sport
we are both not touching this game .,sport
ill take the charger and the money line and parlay it with two other team to make up a parlay for myself today .,sport
what i am going to do ?,sport
here what i am going to do .,sport
and and again live betting .,sport
live betting today. . have your conviction going in live bet today .,sport
i am giving much advice today. . have your conviction because i want them not to lose .,sport
i want you to i want you to pick game that you liked in the beginning of the day .,sport
and then i want you to see how that went .,sport
and then i want you to look at four thirty game and think if you were even close .,sport
if you are having a day you are having a day brother .,sport
but if you are not i am saying you can get absolutely wiped out here .,sport
a quick parlay that i charger jet and texan all money line three team parlay charger jet .,sport
charger jet texan all money line .,sport
i love that bet .,sport
parlay those three team .,sport
there you go .,sport
i always we always to give you something guy .,sport
but yeah thats one that i liked that i am going to be doing myself .,sport
yeah i liked that one .,sport
do you could you can play that one .,sport
it feel today one going to be you are going to play one too many .,sport
and thats why i am limiting myself this week .,sport
limiting my listen guy i showed you my bet last week from the previous week .,sport
yeah you were ever you i am everywhere .,sport
i put many bet out there .,sport
i you guy are going to look at my bet sheet next week and be holy shit you were .,sport
you you barely bet this week .,sport
but where i am betting thats where i am going to i am betting strategically .,sport
you still there with u ?,sport
some type of interference .,sport
it is still breaking from that .,sport
talk about the game and let see what we have here .,sport
trying to fix the audio here guy .,sport
i can hear you but it is it is it is tough to hear .,sport
it is a break up .,sport
i can hear it .,sport
i can hear it .,sport
you hear it ?,sport
i hear it .,sport
still still tough .,sport
it is whatever that thing is .,sport
i think maybe i need to get a new one .,sport
a blue i think .,sport
well stick with it .,sport
what do we got ?,sport
weve got all these talk ?,sport
you can look at that on the other side .,sport
you can see the all what do we got ?,sport
weve got all these talk ?,sport
you while greg get everything straight now and over there .,sport
we got carolina and weve got denver carolina and denver we got a here what i love fantasy farm sport .,sport
we talk about fantasy sport all the time i think if you are looking for a little bit of running back this week ?,sport
what are you ?,sport
they are beautiful place to visit but at the end of the day they are not good .,sport
they are not good football team but they are nice town ?,sport
i think you agree .,sport
there not a lot there ?,sport
ive got two check mark by denver .,sport
the real i am gon na wait on this one .,sport
well talk about the non game ?,sport
greg still get thing straight now over there can not see shes versus the la vega raider the raider are getting nine and a half .,sport
they feel they are down and out .,sport
look at the same thing we were talking about miami the arizona could have been there to party all week .,sport
ive got taking the la vega raider nine and a half today .,sport
i think it is a real close call for kansa city and kansa city win but barely thats what i have .,sport
i got nine and a half good at la vega raider moving on well talk about the late game because i know if we get greg back .,sport
hell want to talk about certain game .,sport
i want to leave some some thought there for him .,sport
ive got the giant .,sport
ive got the steelers thirty six and a half and the giant are getting six point traveling to pittsburgh and i know we all watched that game last ?,sport
no we all watched that game we understand that we understand we understand that the pittsburgh steelers should absolutely destroy they have to destroy but these two team work each other do not they ?,sport
think about it .,sport
when you think about the steelers and you think about the giant they want to do the same thing both of them want to run the ball both of them need to run the ball and i understand that russell wilson looked good .,sport
did the jet quit last week the jet did quit a little last week they quit we got to be honest the jet quit and thats if they quit but we know they did and pittsburgh broke their back .,sport
i think the giant are gon na fight hard here thirty six and a half there not a lot of room at thirty six and a half thirty six and a half there not a lot of room at thirty six and a half for six point .,sport
i and i again i think the giant every single player is fighting for their nfl career there they want to take part .,sport
we all watched it .,sport
he started throwing the game away and i do not think daniel jones will throw the game away .,sport
all not quite yet but we are still working on greg there all game one about one whoop can you hear me ?,sport
yeah yeah i want to talk about the chicago bear the chicago bear are out of hibernation this winter they are playing against the washington commander the washington commander they have done a good job they have pairing the the quarterback together .,sport
washington defense ha gotten a little bit better but i do not think they are chicago chicago came into this year havent worked hard to even get win last year and in their ability to win they leaned on themselves .,sport
i think chicago is the better football team i maybe not necessarily the best quarterback that i think could be true jaden daniel healthy is the better quarterback .,sport
are you with u ?,sport
i do not that kyle shanahan locker side talk and all this other garbage that go along with it .,sport
i do not that .,sport
i think what we need to do is we need to live with the fact that brock purdy is not perfect .,sport
who care ?,sport
who care that he not perfect ?,sport
they are playing against your dallas cowboy and america team it might be but i do not think they are america team .,sport
you can not run they do not run it very .,sport
you need to be able to jerry jones made comment this week about derek henry about how he wouldnt fit their offense who wouldnt fit their offense ?,sport
why would you ?,sport
he not gon na fit your offense .,sport
can not you build a more productive house ?,sport
instead of living in the same one that you are in you could build a more productive he derek henry you brought him mccarthy because he this great offensive mind if he wa such a great offensive mind couldnt he incorporate a great running back ?,sport
you need a guy to run the whole machine and thats not mccarthy now jerry jones understands that but he stuck he got to say whatever he gon na say to keep his sponsor the fact the matter is he not even the best .,sport
he not even the best pony in dallas anymore not even the best pony no best pony the best team is houston texas can you hear me ?,sport
no whats whats going on i have no idea i sound you are calling me from space .,sport
i i think the 49ers are a better football team than the catalan cowboy i think the cowboy can play because the 49ers secondary is not very good it is not i do not make the rule .,sport
yeah this is good .,sport
yeah 49ers secondary is not very good but i think dallas is competitive here this is the way and i think this is fairly how you could see it happen ?,sport
we are in san francisco .,sport
we are not in dallas not in dallas and i think the four and a half that dallas is getting it is one of those that feel good feel good to be getting four and a half a a cowboy .,sport
it feel thats a line .,sport
you will not look a stooge you do not want to look a stooge do not get your eye poked out wheres that camera ?,sport
there it is .,sport
do not get those eye poked out believe in what san francisco ha there they have a good running game at jordan mason .,sport
i can not spend my money .,sport
i think we can end on this day bill parcells say you are what your record is and i think the 49ers have showcased the fact that they are not the team that we found and saw last week .,sport
what i would do is i would absolutely bet on the 49ers today and i would leave the dallas cowboy the second best team in dallas or the second best team in texas alone take those 49ers on the money line guy be very careful today .,sport
you want to be very careful thats what we want to stress to you be very careful with your bet .,sport
you do not have to take everything .,sport
you do not even have to play this week enjoy your family .,sport
enjoy your food .,sport
ventson van gogh people told him you can not be a great painter you only have one ear .,sport
what he said ?,sport
you are now listening to sip and sport a philly sport talk morning show with chris kj and dalt proudly powered by three hundred and two bird .,sport
let take it to the show .,sport
good morning .,sport
welcome to another episode of sip and sport .,sport
a we always do we will give you guy that prerecording disclosure .,sport
we are prerecording this friday night october 25th .,sport
on that saturday your flyer will be playing and we have no clue what the hell is going to happen in the sixer game .,sport
well figure all that out here in a second .,sport
but kj chris how are we doing fella ?,sport
i know the flyer have sucked a of late but i am going to my first game .,sport
it is i guess it is today since we are prerecording .,sport
i am excited for that .,sport
i am going to see mitch kauffs first regular season game .,sport
my first time seeing mitch kauff regular season .,sport
i am excited for that .,sport
but coming back we got back from that .,sport
that eagle wa jet giant .,sport
why am i saying jet ?,sport
gain from last week and flying high from that still for sure .,sport
that wa fun .,sport
that wa a blast .,sport
we had the time of our life over there and met live stadium .,sport
chris wa there .,sport
adult wa there .,sport
jack it wa it wa a great for gizzle .,sport
it wa a great freaking time for sure .,sport
and we even got to introduce mikey d to chris and adult and jack and everybody .,sport
and that wa that wa awesome .,sport
i think it wa it wa fun to can up on a giant fan .,sport
we did not we did not mess with them too much though .,sport
that wa a good thing because the eagle did the rest for u . yeah .,sport
the game spoke for itself .,sport
both of you guy said which we will react to that here in a second and everything else a we do .,sport
but if you guy are in here be sure to it up share it up all that good stuff .,sport
because when we are pre recording those little thing help .,sport
they help u to prevent from coming out slow the philadelphia plot .,sport
see but chris ill let you go ahead and take it first .,sport
i am going to be there today .,sport
what what are you looking forward to with the flyer ?,sport
what have you not liked with the flyer ?,sport
what doe this team need to do a a whole ?,sport
they are a young team .,sport
i think thats the biggest thing .,sport
you got a kid who what you got you got two guy one who eighteen one who nineteen who are not your the face of the team but they are two young building block .,sport
and it is a younger team than weve had in year past .,sport
and they are going to struggle at time .,sport
it is it is how it is .,sport
i think we got a little bit of a tease with the flyer last year the way they were able to come out hot and look they were going to make the playoff .,sport
it is i think weve got to bear in with this team .,sport
and yeah it is going to be a long season .,sport
they are not going to be a great team but you are going to it is going to be exciting to see these young guy mitch coving .,sport
he had a two goal game the one night .,sport
and luchenko who is eighteen barely eighteen year old the youngest flyer to ever play .,sport
it is it is a different it is a different season .,sport
and it is going to be a it is going to be a in some aspect of long season because i do not see them winning that many game this year .,sport
i thought it might have been a building block year from last year .,sport
they would have snuck into the playoff but they got even younger than they were last year .,sport
well see how they can continue to roll through this year .,sport
but i my expectation are not too high .,sport
and i think thats what make it fun is the expectation are not high .,sport
thats said .,sport
i do not think you could have put it a better way there at the end .,sport
thats what make it fun .,sport
yeah it should be interesting to see what they got .,sport
obviously now they are what are they they are one in five now .,sport
chris they are one in five .,sport
they are going to be two in five .,sport
two in five .,sport
they are going to be .,sport
they are going to be .,sport
speaking of their existence mitch cause having the six goal game .,sport
thatd be awesome .,sport
and then hopefully after sunday when i am at the game on sunday theyll be a game .,sport
whats up ?,sport
thatll be insane .,sport
i think thats going to be a great way to go .,sport
well be three in five .,sport
well be climbing back up on the standing .,sport
thatll be good to see .,sport
but but yeah a chris wa saying piggyback off that very young team a lot of inexperience .,sport
a lot of guy were trying to figure out what the role what their role is and what what their job is .,sport
i think this team ha a lot of growing to do .,sport
and once once everything is the puzzle are in the piece .,sport
i do feel that this is going to be a good working oil machine for short but it is going to take time a chris said it is going to take time and you got to be patient .,sport
we were for the for the six year and then it exploded in our face and whatever .,sport
and now it is still exploding in our face .,sport
thats why it is hard for u a philly fan to trust the whole process thing especially a building process .,sport
well see what happens .,sport
i do feel though this will come back and itll be something productive and not something negative .,sport
well going to have to wait and see what happens .,sport
and one more thing before we move on .,sport
mitch cobb is on pace for a point a game now .,sport
he got seven point in seven game for a rookie to have a point a game is it is not unheard of but it is something the flyer i do not think it ever had .,sport
thats one thing to watch out for is can he continue this pace and get a point a game .,sport
he leading the team in goal already .,sport
the guy nineteen year old and showing a ton of flash already .,sport
he here and it is at least i think thats the thing that excites me .,sport
it is almost when we first got in bead with the sixer you could tell that generational type talent wa there and it is already coming to fruition and well see where it go .,sport
for you guy have said for him and jet what the two have already done to turn the organization .,sport
it is it is amazing what a good attitude can do .,sport
you almost want to say to conor baddard hey this is what could have been if you got your shit together but i am happy it worked out the way that it did .,sport
i think it couldnt have worked out better for flyer fan a . but the direction that the organization is headed is refreshing awesome great to see a a fan .,sport
now coming out slow .,sport
chris said it earlier and i want to say it again .,sport
a team with no expectation is the best team to root for and watch because anytime that they do anything you can go crazy because they suck .,sport
we did not know that with the phillies this year obviously .,sport
we knew that a couple year ago when the phillies went to the world series because nobody expected them to .,sport
same thing with the eagle when they won the super bowl in two thousand and eighteen and when they went to the super bowl i guess you could say in two thousand and twenty two nobody .,sport
there something to be said for team in philadelphia that have no business being in a championship being in a championship .,sport
there also something said for i do not know why but first year player or first year thing working out for philadelphia team and them ending up in championship and some guy winning something in their rookie year .,sport
thats still a crazy story for the eagle .,sport
but ill say this about mishkov .,sport
i love the way that he embrace the city too .,sport
i saw i guess he went to the phillies playoff game a couple week back or something and he wa in a parking lot and there this random dude .,sport
he no different than chris or kj or me or somebody thats a diehard flyer fan in the parking lot tailgating the phillies game .,sport
an average dude walk up and he holy shit thats mishkov .,sport
and he yo go phils and mishkov who barely speaks any english in the video is saying go phils and he embracing it .,sport
when somebody that back the city that buy in and theyve only been here a short amount of time it is awesome .,sport
it is great to see .,sport
and speaking of another guy who only been here for a short amount of time but he even said it in his own press conference .,sport
he feel he been here for a while with the way that this team treat him the way that these fan treat him top to bottom .,sport
and i am talking about the king of new york .,sport
no jj segalo not you you motherfucker .,sport
i am talking about the real king of new york .,sport
we did not know what to expect with this game .,sport
we knew that sey kwan wa going to go off .,sport
we did not know which way he wa going to give it to him .,sport
he gave it to him straight .,sport
there were a lot of play both side of the ball that were made but the score the score i think told the story that you needed to know .,sport
the giant had a couple of sack here and there .,sport
ill give them credit where credit due .,sport
but other than that they did not do anything anything game .,sport
offensively they were catastrophe .,sport
the eagle defense wa all over them .,sport
a a fan in the stand it wa great because we were dominating them dominating them .,sport
and a a giant fan they were all demoralized .,sport
that one touchdown to aj brown i saw it in slow motion .,sport
and i want to say shout out with everybody that show u the hospitality there year after year and each other because that wa a pretty fun tailgate that we had going on on sunday and an even better result .,sport
it wa the cherry on top for the drive .,sport
it wa a great time for sure .,sport
and it wa great seeing saekwon honestly get his revenge that he wanted .,sport
and i think if you heard the story beforehand he wa on the team bus .,sport
i heard a story that he wa on the team bus and there wa a bunch of giant fan with a poll that had saekwon barkley giant jersey and they burned it in front of his eye .,sport
and he did not seem fazed by it .,sport
he took that a motivation .,sport
he what ?,sport
i am going to do my job out there .,sport
they are doing that stuff .,sport
obviously theyll seem disrespectful but that mean that they miss me and stuff that because they do .,sport
and it wa ill tell you one thing being at that stadium hearing the horrific i do not know if you guy heard it or not .,sport
and i think it wa only from a couple of people but then i also heard it in general though .,sport
people were booing and they were putting a lot of the hate towards saekwon .,sport
there were jersey that said traitor .,sport
there wa jersey that said snake one turncoat .,sport
something coat or whatever .,sport
jj had to figure out what turncoat meant .,sport
he looked at mikey d. he what doe turncoat mean ?,sport
and mikey d. yeah we do not know what turncoat mean .,sport
thats some paul revere shit .,sport
it is not going to be ashamed of fucking weird as word .,sport
and mikey d. of course he he a turncoat .,sport
and then he told u what turncoat .,sport
a turncoat is a coat you do not want to wear .,sport
and we are .,sport
and we looked it up and sure shit mike wa .,sport
and it is an old way to say traitor but go ahead kj .,sport
there nothing bad about it .,sport
yeah that wa but that wa interesting .,sport
i heard some very vulgar comment about saekwon .,sport
not a a player but a a man .,sport
and it wa it wa all the heat that philadelphia sport fan get .,sport
it wa weve seen it though with new york and it seems they do not get too much heat .,sport
they came to the sexer stadium and got bought a bunch of our gear and they burned it in a pile .,sport
and then obviously i know saekwon leaf but you are putting all the blame on saekwon himself .,sport
but when it wa your gm that screwed the pooch he wa the main reason they were making the wrong guy .,sport
and thats what ticked me off because people he left .,sport
he a traitor .,sport
screw you saekwon .,sport
it is no your gm had a chance to not pay daniel jones .,sport
it showed that you made the wrong decision because daniel jones did not even throw for a touchdown in this game .,sport
heck he hasnt even thrown for a touchdown at metlife stadium this year .,sport
and when the heck in your head did you think it wa any bit of a good idea to be what ?,sport
i am going to give him this much of a contract that he doesnt deserve and not pay your running back .,sport
you do not want to pay a running back sometimes because the running back position it is not a valuable a a quarterback position .,sport
thats the problem .,sport
he not valuable .,sport
i do not see why the heck it is almost when the titan they decided what ?,sport
they are going to take it away .,sport
another bonehead general manager decision by an organization .,sport
and the eagle are a team to find out and they are able to swoop in and get saquon .,sport
who doe the howie for honestly getting saquon here making him feel at home .,sport
and we are making him feel at home with the fan .,sport
and thats great to see because even though there many saquon hater there there were a lot of people there that were supporting saquon and wed love to see him get in the end zone twice .,sport
that wa electric .,sport
that wa it almost felt even though it wasnt a home game you had enough .,sport
it wa a home game .,sport
you had enough eagle fan there to make it feel it wa a home game .,sport
and the one thing i want to say to mac off of your point there were mostly saquon jersey there for eagle fan .,sport
most of the eagle jersey were saquon jersey .,sport
that wa cool to see fire fought with ice .,sport
what with the giant ?,sport
they are going to wear their turncoat jersey or their other giant jersey .,sport
we are all decked out in saquon .,sport
that wa cool to say .,sport
whats up ?,sport
i think the one thing that truly speaks to how great not on the field saquon is but a a person in general is when sirianni went to him and asked him if he wanted to stay in the game he got thirteen yard to tie his career high .,sport
and this wa what the end of the third quarter .,sport
he would have beat that record .,sport
he said let the young let the young dog eat .,sport
that is such a selfless thing .,sport
he could have broke his career high against his former team and he sits back there and what ?,sport
he said what ?,sport
let will shipley get some carry .,sport
thats it is incredible .,sport
not only the player they got but the person they got a . and i think a lot of this stuff with the giant fan it is it is jealousy because they know what he is .,sport
and i feel bad for gisel because he wa out there .,sport
he wa on the verge of tear .,sport
it wa this is a lot .,sport
this wa a lot of giant fan favorite player .,sport
theyve had some bleak year and the one thing they had is a running back who would go in and burst off a big thirty yard run here and there .,sport
ill say kwann did that three time in one game and ran the fastest he ever did in his career against his former team .,sport
to see the way he say kwann wa it is incredible .,sport
i am glad it wa only seventeen carry he had to do .,sport
let keep these carry down .,sport
let keep him healthy .,sport
it is hard to watch that .,sport
and shout out to gisel too .,sport
if he listening to the show we love you man .,sport
thanks for hosting u a always .,sport
but thats got to suck too to see your favorite player go to your .,sport
that wa the one thing that all the giant fan kept saying is he could have picked any other team .,sport
but at the end of the day you got to go to who giving you the best money .,sport
you got to go to who giving you the best opportunity to win a super bowl and say kwann probably looked across the nfc east a long time ago .,sport
i think longer than you guy think and though .,sport
maybe the grass is and metaphorically greener on the other side and being greener .,sport
better turf a . yeah there you go a . but it wa nice to see to the go ahead .,sport
did you want to say something chris ?,sport
do you think that he wanted to get taken out of the game a little bit we did not get hurt on that turf ?,sport
yes i glad that you asked that .,sport
i think that there part of that to it too .,sport
there almost these guy are going ham hardest fuck and i went ham hardest fuck the whole game .,sport
and obviously i proved myself .,sport
it is almost he ha nothing else to prove .,sport
why go out there when they are all playing bully ball looking to kill him looking to hurt him looking to ruin his season not saying they are looking to injure somebody but they are looking to put him on his as which could hurt him .,sport
and i think it wa i think it wa strategic but it wa also selfless .,sport
it wa a combination of the two where it worked out .,sport
i do not think he knew when he did it though that it would be this whole medium thing .,sport
i do not think he knew that at all .,sport
eagle defense though that wa the one thing i want to highlight a . it wa appetizing wholesome whatever word you want to use to describe it .,sport
i had a bunch of them when we were there but it wa great to see a nice eagle complete win and especially defensively .,sport
vic fangio you got to give credit to where credit due .,sport
and he ha had this team playing i think on a whole other level to where theyve been in tune .,sport
they know what the offense is going to run before the offense run it .,sport
and they seem wizard wizard of the game .,sport
they seem technician .,sport
and i havent been able to say that about the eagle defense in at least the season since ganon wa here .,sport
it is very very nice to see that and very refreshing that he got these guy playing top tier ball .,sport
he got these guy doing the thing that they need to be doing and coming in prepared because thats your defensive coordinator job at the end of the day is to make sure your team is prepared .,sport
we all know brian fucking john or i am sorry sean decide did not have anybody prepared .,sport
brian johnson to i guess thats why my brain said that .,sport
but sean decide wa nonexistent a a defensive core .,sport
i do not i do not even know if he talked in a locker room .,sport
i never heard him say anything and i can not remember any of his press conference .,sport
you need somebody that can be that old head .,sport
i know that that wa our beef .,sport
i want to go back to that because we all said it myself especially when vic came here .,sport
we were hypothetically scared of vic because his age and his way to connect with this team .,sport
some of the thing that people were saying brandon graham .,sport
vic he going to be stuck in his way .,sport
but maybe it is a good thing .,sport
maybe vic fangio we thought know what he doing .,sport
and maybe this is his final swanson and it is going to be a benefit for the eagle .,sport
but golly the past two week i think no touchdown allowed or something i saw too which is fucking nut for a defensive coordinator .,sport
and the one thing that vic fangio is doing is is finding a way to make adjustment and get struggling player into a better position .,sport
bryce huff the other day look tremendous .,sport
he looked the player that we signed that we thought we were getting when we signed .,sport
and for him he feel more comfortable out of this stance than the other stance .,sport
and i trashed him for that in our pregame comfort in our pregame podcast .,sport
and what doe he do ?,sport
he go out there and get a sec .,sport
i am glad they are making adjustment and a secondary is playing extremely extremely .,sport
quinion mitchell man he he locked down he he .,sport
malik neighbor is going to be hell over receiver in the nfl .,sport
he already is a hell of a receiver in the nfl .,sport
thats it is incredible what he doing out there .,sport
yeah i know the interception are not there but when you can trust that you can have a rookie out there against legit wide receiver .,sport
it is such a comforting thing .,sport
and the same with cooper degene he been tremendous .,sport
and yeah ive busted on slay for a while but he wa good the other day a . to see these guy starting to gel a a unit now it is good to see .,sport
and hopefully this past rush continues to do what the past rush did this week .,sport
because they they look they are cooking at all aspect .,sport
and even nicoby dean had two sack .,sport
you look every single aspect of this defense defensive tackle defensive end linebacker corner safety .,sport
they were all all over the field on sunday .,sport
and if they can continue to do that you are looking at the top five defense in the nfl if they can hold that up .,sport
now it is the philadelphia eagle .,sport
are they going to hold that up ?,sport
yeah i think it wa an adult wa saying before .,sport
in two week we havent let up a touchdown .,sport
i will say this though we did play against two of the worst team in the nfl .,sport
that is one of the i guess you can .,sport
yes it is one of the obvious point i guess you can say .,sport
but it is still impressive .,sport
i still feel it is because i think they are also using these two game a building block for them to still keep aggressive a a defense .,sport
a chris pointed to a before nacobi dean thats great to see a linebacker getting to sack in this game and this error now .,sport
you do not see too many linebacker getting sack especially with the eagle .,sport
i do not remember ever seeing an eagle get a crazy game of multiple sack that .,sport
he he looked awesome .,sport
he looked the linebacker we wanted him to be .,sport
and hopefully he could keep it up .,sport
i do not know if they are going to keep him going with the blitz again but well see .,sport
vic fangio i think he wa this wa a good two week to test out the defense and see what potential they have and try to see what he can do to help mold this defense into a chris wa saying before and maybe an elite defense .,sport
not saying they are an elite defense because they did play two of the worst offense in the league but this could be a building block for sure .,sport
and it wa cool to see quinn a chris wa saying a quinion mitchell and cooper dizine out there locking down these receiver .,sport
now they are not the best receiver .,sport
malik neighbor obviously a rookie but you got some other guy too wanda robinson who is a who on one of my fantasy team .,sport
he a pretty decent receiver .,sport
he wasnt getting anything at all .,sport
yeah it wa good to see those young guy go at it and keep the keep the fort locked down .,sport
that wa good .,sport
and yeah to see bryce huff .,sport
at first i wa saying this with jack me and jack were at the beginning of the game .,sport
we were trying to study what john not bryce huff .,sport
see i caught myself there adult .,sport
and thats what bryce huff wa doing .,sport
and we noticed that first that he wa jogging .,sport
he wa jogging when he wa going for a blitz and we are this is where it seems he doesnt want to play .,sport
but then i think it wa either in the second quarter or the third quarter .,sport
he went full throttle and i think what chris wa saying before he went in a different stand .,sport
i think vic vanjo said do your stance that you are used to here at metlife stadium .,sport
you are used to do it best and go at the quarterback .,sport
and thats what he did .,sport
and he got a sack .,sport
that wa great to say .,sport
and they looked they looked they looked good .,sport
hopefully they can keep it up .,sport
you got a an offensive line in the bengal which is almost a bad a the giant but they are a little better .,sport
you could try and expose that offensive line .,sport
if they do that thatll be great .,sport
and they can maybe shut down joe barrow this weekend .,sport
yeah i think you guy both pretty much hit the nail on the head with the defense .,sport
moving along now to our sixer .,sport
kj ill let you go ahead and take this one first .,sport
the sixer are playing now .,sport
i havent even looked at the score for an update but it is not looking good from the intro game .,sport
on i guess you could say the season opener on wednesday and bede and george both not playing but whats up with this team man ?,sport
whats going on ?,sport
now they are i believe they are winning .,sport
it say they are winning .,sport
i think it say they are winning twenty seven to twenty six .,sport
it is still early .,sport
this team now is and i hope that they and i know i am saying this a a sixer fan i want them to get fined for what they are doing .,sport
i want them to get fined for the load management crap that they are doing .,sport
they should get fined because you are paying joe and bede this crazy amount of money and it is for him to play not to watch not to manage his injury and everything everything that .,sport
i get what you are trying to do but dude we are paying this guy and it bother me a lot .,sport
it doe a a basketball fan a a fan of who believed in nb and i am starting to not believe in the guy and hopefully i can get that belief back .,sport
i hope we can a sixer fan but it is hard to believe in that when you realize that nb is not hurt now .,sport
they are trying to arrest him now and that doesnt rub me the way at all .,sport
paul george thats a different story .,sport
we saw that he wa playing the preseason .,sport
he injured his it could have been a horrible injury to his knee .,sport
it could have been way more horrific but it is going to be hell be back in i think it said this game and then the next game he should be back in two more game .,sport
well see pg back in the court for the sixer but i though the rotation they have .,sport
i know that they did not have that good of a game against the buck .,sport
i do feel this rotation is deep and i that because we havent had that for a while .,sport
thats the main thing i feel with the sixer .,sport
obviously it did not have a good game but let see what else they can do when they get back and beat and paul george .,sport
let say but i am not happy with the whole load management crap .,sport
i think it is total bull crap to the diehard fan especially the one that paid for the home opener .,sport
expecting that they were going to see and beat and paul george and the team did not tell them till last minute .,sport
that wa screwed up .,sport
i do feel that wa screwed up .,sport
yeah this is the least excited ive been for sixer team in year .,sport
and you guy both know i wasnt the throat on the whole paul george signing .,sport
i did not think it moved the needle at all .,sport
and now you got joel embiid who ramping up to play .,sport
it is what he wa fine when he played in the olympics and they are saying he did not get it hurt in the olympics .,sport
what the hell is he ramping up for ?,sport
whats he not doing in the off season ?,sport
you paid this dude nearly two hundred million over three year .,sport
he not ready to play basketball .,sport
what is going on ?,sport
that this is a joke at this point .,sport
if joel embiids not serious about basketball then why the hell is he on the team ?,sport
i know he a hell of a player .,sport
but why is he not ready ?,sport
it is it is a joke at this point .,sport
and i feel these people who pay money for season ticket should get their money back .,sport
because now you are saying he not going to play back to back .,sport
how many game are you going to play at home ?,sport
you got people paying for season ticket and they are not going to see the best player in the nba for majority of those game for load management .,sport
it is bullshit .,sport
and if he is hurt how do you get hurt ?,sport
it is a whole nother situation here .,sport
and then the sister are probably going to dock draft pick because they do not know how to fucking manage it .,sport
it is it is a bad organization .,sport
they got too much shit going on .,sport
the team want to move to center city now .,sport
it is it is a joke .,sport
josh harris need to sell this damn team already .,sport
go focus on the commander .,sport
get the fuck out of philadelphia .,sport
i am tired of this shit with the sixer .,sport
in mediocrity .,sport
we started this whole process because we couldnt get past the second round .,sport
we still can not get past the fucking second round .,sport
what is going to change here ?,sport
nothing ha changed .,sport
let keep signing aging superstar to act it is going to help .,sport
when i got two aging superstar because i do not know how much longer to own beat going to be able to play .,sport
if he can not play back to back now .,sport
why did you sign into a two hundred million deal ?,sport
they operate on the heart .,sport
josh harris is a joke of an owner in general .,sport
and i agree with chris .,sport
the problem is though he entitled and he doesnt care about the fan at all .,sport
which it is funny though because commander fan are josh harris what a great owner he is .,sport
i am going to tell you this now .,sport
i am going to tell you this now .,sport
he a horrible owner .,sport
obviously he no snyder .,sport
yeah i am going to say thats what we were all about to say .,sport
they had dan snyder to work with before .,sport
yeah he no snyder but he doesnt care about .,sport
he got too many team now .,sport
and obviously the commander are his priority now .,sport
it is his baby .,sport
and the sixer are a number to him .,sport
yeah the sixer are his teenage child .,sport
thats what it is with the sixer that go in his room and play video game .,sport
thats what it is dan .,sport
yeah it is with the sixer it is what the hell is going on every week .,sport
and i havent even watched the game yet .,sport
i will not watch the game tonight .,sport
i might go to a game or two this year maybe .,sport
but i am starting to wonder if maybe it is not the sixer .,sport
if maybe it is not the flyer .,sport
maybe it is well fargo .,sport
because how the fuck are these two team this consistently fucked out this .,sport
they are kjs .,sport
the thing it is funny kj .,sport
i had redheaded stepchild written down on my note .,sport
but the thing i had written down wa the sixer are a cheeto .,sport
at a fancy cheese tasting .,sport
they are out of their own league all the time .,sport
you look at all the other and that wa in regard to all the other philly sport team the flyer .,sport
the eagle .,sport
the phillies .,sport
the eagle and philly specifically .,sport
yeah they havent won the big one in a couple of year .,sport
but at least they get there .,sport
at least theyve gotten there in the past couple of year .,sport
there something to be said for that .,sport
they can not even fucking get there .,sport
they are the little engine that fucking couldnt .,sport
and they are not getting any better .,sport
at this point it is .,sport
i guess what i am trying to say with embiid in this injury thing is you guy are .,sport
there is no injury .,sport
there no problem .,sport
but when i heard nick nurse talk about it the other day i honestly couldnt blame the guy .,sport
because he said it this .,sport
the one thing we havent tried yet with embiid is getting into the playoff healthy .,sport
i think that the sixer are going to slick and slide their way in whatever way they can get embiid into the playoff playing healthy .,sport
if it cost them some money and some fine .,sport
i think that they are all in on winning a championship this year and the top priority for the sixer in winning a championship is making sure joel is healthy .,sport
and i think that by doing this they are looking to protect him because he can prove it during the regular season .,sport
he done that .,sport
a far a how do i feel about that .,sport
it is not not a good product on the court .,sport
it is not a good product for your fan and it is not fair to season ticket holder which is why i do not even want to waste my breath anymore on the sixer .,sport
i will say one more thing though .,sport
i also feel if you do not play them together though a we said before they are not going to have any chemistry .,sport
then when the playoff do come up where the hecks going to be the chemistry .,sport
hopefully these guy paul george and and b can keep some chemistry going somehow and hopefully they are still working on that .,sport
but yeah thats thats thats the problem with it though .,sport
i agree and i feel bad for nick nurse because i feel he the coach for this position and the coach for this team .,sport
but it is embiid is holding him back from being the coach that we wanted for this organization .,sport
but but yeah we could move on from it because taking away kj we are going into cincinnati into the jungle to play the good looking handsome devil himself and joe burrow .,sport
you nervous you excited you combination of the two .,sport
i do feel the bengal have been theyve been slow out the gate .,sport
it seems they havent i think whats their record now .,sport
they are what they two and three now or something that .,sport
i think they are i forget their record .,sport
but they are they are on the slow rate now .,sport
it seems and burrow ha been looking iffy but he also been able to get jamar chase involved .,sport
thats thats a good thing .,sport
and i think we got we got to watch out for that too .,sport
we got to watch out for that .,sport
i heard that t higgins might be questionable .,sport
i do know for the eagle though .,sport
i do not know if you guy heard this dallas goddard will not be playing .,sport
it say that he is not to be playing this weekend .,sport
it seems well well be having calcuttaire and stole out there manning the ship at the tight end position .,sport
it seems but but you have adult you are muted .,sport
i wa going to say something when you were done .,sport
but yeah i think it is it is going to be interesting game .,sport
i predicted this on the show on wednesday .,sport
i think the eagle do keep this close .,sport
i do think they get they sneak the win .,sport
i think they win twenty six to twenty .,sport
i think they somehow win by six point .,sport
and i do not know how but they are going to win .,sport
they are going to take the point this time .,sport
they are going to take the point next year on is going to be very strategic and he going to be smart somehow .,sport
i do not know why i am thinking this but i think they are going to win twenty six to twenty .,sport
now the defense is not going to have that much of a dominant defensive performance they had against the giant .,sport
i think the bengal are going to be a little tougher .,sport
the offensive line is going to be a little tougher .,sport
you will not be seeing those young buck out there getting the i guess you could say the activity that they had last week against the giant with the i guess in the sack margin .,sport
yeah ill say this because i got to be a little bit quicker because we got a wrap up here in a minute .,sport
i am excited for it .,sport
i think it is going to be an entertaining game .,sport
the bengal are notoriously a team that the eagle have struggled against .,sport
we all know it unfortunately but i think that this is going to be a game that jalen hertz play up to .,sport
i wa listening to wip today and a guy called in and he said it and i wa laughing my as off at it because it is true .,sport
and he said something along the line of jalen hertz play up to good competition .,sport
and when he played patrick mahomes when he played josh allen there wa another qb in that list too .,sport
i am drawing a blank on who but he play up to them .,sport
he ha something to prove and he doe .,sport
i think in this game joe burrow being somebody thats highly respected in his draft class somebody that wa taking early .,sport
i think he going to say what i want to show that i want the same level a this guy .,sport
i want to show that athletically i can do the same thing that he can do .,sport
now is he on the same iq on the same playing level maybe not much but doe he have the better team .,sport
hell to the yeah .,sport
doe joe burrow have an aj brown or saquon barkley or devonte smith .,sport
he ha jamar chase but he doesnt have that whole fucking grocery list thats going to feed him for week .,sport
jalen hertz ha no excuse this shouldnt be a close game .,sport
i think that this should be at least a two score win for the eagle with what we saw last week .,sport
the bengal defense looking at it .,sport
i expect the eagle the eagle offense need to put up at least thirty five point this game in my opinion .,sport
well say yeah i think that you are underselling the bengal .,sport
three of the four bengal loss came against the chief commander and raven who are good team .,sport
it wa the other one .,sport
this is a tough game and the eagle wa never one in cincinnati at all .,sport
it is it is not going to be easy game whatsoever .,sport
the bengal their defense on paper is not great but i feel they play up the way they play .,sport
they play better than what the talent show .,sport
it is going to be a little bit tougher game than you expect .,sport
they got big defensive end .,sport
it might be a little bit tougher to run against them which mean you are going to have to have jalen hertz beat you .,sport
you are going to have to have jalen hertz carry you and the last two game theyve won havent been because of jalen hertz .,sport
it is been because of the wrong game .,sport
i hope it is a little bit different .,sport
defense need to get pressure on borough .,sport
they can not let him sit back there and throw the jomar chase all day .,sport
i see it being a low scoring close game a twenty oneseventeen type game .,sport
but i honestly do not think the eagle are going to win .,sport
i think joe borough is going to pull this one out .,sport
you can not count out joe borough sometimes .,sport
i think he been a little bit overhated here over the last two or three year since they went to the super bowl and lost .,sport
i think he a much better quarterback than what he showed and he had some injury problem and stuff that .,sport
but yeah i i think joe borough is going to out duel jalen hertz here and sneak out of win .,sport
yeah i think you are .,sport
and you are not wrong .,sport
look i am not trying to undersell the bangle but i do think that their defense the eagle should should keyword should .,sport
thats the problem .,sport
but will they ?,sport
thats the main question .,sport
will they ?,sport
well find out .,sport
another thing to keep an eye on two guy is the brother will be playing in sydney and chase brown .,sport
thatll be fun to watch with sydney being on defense .,sport
chase ha already seen that yet chase is started this week out running back for the bangle .,sport
thats pretty cool .,sport
congratulation to his brother .,sport
he is fast a shit .,sport
i saw where that speed came from on the pick six but it is going to be a good game .,sport

other than that hope you guy have a good weekend and we are out of here .,sport
we are out of here .,sport
we are out of here .,sport
hello everyone welcome back to nerdist in the venture and sport podcast .,sport
we finally got the big game that weve been waiting on for long georgia texas well be for sure talking about that later on in the show .,sport
but davion i know you are probably doing great .,sport
i am doing le ideal because and i think these are related to the two .,sport
davion how are you doing ?,sport
let me say this .,sport
the ranger are doing great .,sport
the patriot are rebuilding which is .,sport
but the yankee man the yankee .,sport
no no the yankee are making it a world series .,sport
what do you got ta say now ?,sport
thats why i thought juan soto judge this team is bringing home the pennant .,sport
gon na get a championship back in new york and i am hype about that .,sport
this could be a great world series .,sport
the dodger are an amazing team a but it is the yankee man .,sport
you wanted the best part about that .,sport
you cut out from the first part .,sport
i heard the last part .,sport
well see what happens in post and see what you had to say .,sport
but anyways what were you saying ?,sport
yeah but rafi the blackhawks are in two and four .,sport
do you have anything to say about that ?,sport
unlike your wild take on the patriot i had realistic expectation for my favorite team the chicago blackhawks .,sport
they knew that it wa going to be another year likely picking the top five .,sport
offense need to get clicking a little bit more but what ?,sport
the talent we are slowly building up .,sport
i where we are at offensively defensively .,sport
we looked a hockey team .,sport
the last two year i couldnt say that about the blackhawks which wa sad and upsetting to watch .,sport
now i can not watch them because the new chicago sport network featuring the bull white sox and blackhawks is not on youtube tv which is ridiculous .,sport
i do not know why the blackhawks decided to partner with him in this stupid thing but it is what it is .,sport
most people can not even watch the blackhawks .,sport
and overall too why are you going to go out of your way to buy an antenna et cetera to watch the bull blackhawks or white sox now ?,sport
none of those three team are particularly good if you are a casual chicago sport fan .,sport
blackhawks are fine .,sport
they are on the track but yeah they are definitely bound for another top five pick this year .,sport
let get into the big thing which is starting in twenty minute a we are recording this podcast at around six.thirty six.forty five pm central time on friday .,sport
and thats the world series .,sport
david you indicated it .,sport
the yankee made it to the world series we are playing the dodger .,sport
now this wa very predictable .,sport
i wanted to change thing up .,sport
and i also this wa a dread from it run from it .,sport
you are getting a yankee dodger world series especially after last year or two where the viewership wa terrible .,sport
and i am sure the mlb the higher up people in mlb were not happy at all with the fact that we had diamondback for serangers .,sport
again very low viewed not too many people cared .,sport
i watched most of those game .,sport
i think i watched all of them .,sport
but for a casual sport fan no one wanted to watch that world series .,sport
and i do not blame them because it wa two smaller market team .,sport
and although there are great story both team were great and it went six game .,sport
no one cared too much to watch it .,sport
if you were let me see whats on this year .,sport
however man the cowboy and lakers fan must be who do i pick ?,sport
do i pick my my favorite team my one a in the dodger or do i pick my one b in the yankee ?,sport
who do i choose ?,sport
they are going to be happy regardless .,sport
but you have you went from two small market team to ill follow what it is the two biggest market the two biggest team arguably not even arguably in the entire mlb playing against each other and clashing it out .,sport
the yankee havent made a world series since two thousand and nine .,sport
ive enjoyed that time .,sport
i hope that they lose this world series .,sport
and you have the dodger who last won the world series in two thousand and twenty but that wa in the sixty game short and season .,sport
a lot of people call that it is a mickey mouse title .,sport
i use the same logic with the lakers .,sport
i applied to the dodger too .,sport
this will be interesting .,sport
and yeah get it .,sport
if you are the mlb this is two massive market .,sport
people are going to tune in in general because it is the dodger versus the yankee .,sport
you have all star on both side .,sport
and this is going to be a great series .,sport
yeah i agree with that .,sport
and for the yankee we do not know if glaber is going to go anywhere .,sport
we do not know where if juan soto stays. . and what ?,sport
and i do not know if theyll be able to provide money for all of those guy .,sport
and for year and year and year they keep falling short .,sport
and now both team have a chance to show that they are the king of baseball and with the young talent and they are exciting to watch .,sport
yankee baseball is always the the bomb the yankee bomber it is i feel it speaks for itself in some way but yeah i am excited for yankee yankee dodger world series .,sport
let talk about georgia texas .,sport
what a game for stuff .,sport
also since when can fan all of a sudden change the call middle of a game ?,sport
here at cornell hockey we love to rile up the ref .,sport
but to throw bottle on the field and then somehow get the call reversed .,sport
some shady stuff happened there .,sport
hey georgia is the team to beat .,sport
this team look i am not the biggest fan of carson beck but they showed off they showed up and unless vandy doe something and pull some crazy thing off georgia georgia is good .,sport
i have no other way of putting it rafi .,sport
what are your thought on the game ?,sport
yeah obviously that wa a big swing where we thought we had it one way .,sport
and then obviously the ref protested and then we wound up getting that pick .,sport
now texas wasnt able to do much with that momentum .,sport
i do not think i think that wa a drive that they killed off that georgia defense wa able to defend .,sport
and i did not watch the first half but twenty three nothing georgia .,sport
i did see that arch manning did come in for a little bit because when yours wa certainly struggling a lot .,sport
and this wa one of those game too that wa concerning if i wa a valuelain quinn or yours draftsak because i do not know .,sport
he wa acting very rattled .,sport
he wa very paranoid from the highlight that i wa watching before he got started out for arch manning .,sport
and it is you are playing at home .,sport
you are this is not an away game for a short .,sport
if it wa a way game for georgia id be carson beck for his alabama a couple of week ago wa completely out of it for the first half and then he came back etc .,sport
quinn yours you are playing at texas .,sport
i do not know why he he did not seem ready to go from the get go .,sport
he did come back in later on but two touchdown one pick .,sport
he wa solid in the second half .,sport
they werent able to dig themselves out of the hole .,sport
it wa a pretty a similar strip to georgia alabama a couple of week ago where one team get out to a big lead in the first half .,sport
and then the other team try to come back a little bit but come up too short .,sport
texas i think they again they could have done more with that momentum .,sport
obviously the rest were able to or the rest turned back overturned that call after .,sport
i do not think necessarily the fan were were we are going to hurt or affect the officiate the rest and the rest will .,sport
we have to change this call .,sport
i think it wa more of they allowed more time because of the lay and then the call got reversed and it wa the .,sport
they wound up making the call .,sport
it wa definitely an intersection for texas .,sport
but it wa disappointing to see how texas they got it to a one square game .,sport
but georgia then wa we are closing this out .,sport
we are not letting texas take this game over .,sport
we are not letting them get the momentum and their defense at a great job of suppressing texas and ensuring that texas wasnt able to complete a drive .,sport
because they were they had a couple of drive that theyve made good progress on .,sport
but georgia would close the door on fourth down to say no you are not getting any point here .,sport
and that wound up being the big difference in this game .,sport
georgia now jump up to the number two team in the country where they are now behind oregon who oregon the ohio state also very recently too .,sport
now oregon number one team undefeated .,sport
penn state is playing ohio state next week not this upcoming weekend .,sport
thats going to be a big game a . but i think we have in my mind now and then well get into another team a too .,sport
this year with the 12th team playoff i think is if there any year to do a twelve team playoff i think it is this year because i honestly do not know who is the best team in college football .,sport
i think there a couple of team that i have at the top where i am georgia texas oregon still ohio state .,sport
those are my big four .,sport
but you also have the penn state .,sport
you have the miami .,sport
miami struggled a little bit and theyve had some top game too .,sport
they almost lost to virginia tech a couple of week ago .,sport
theyve had a rough go of it .,sport
starting game they louisville came back last weekend a made it a close game much closer than it should have been with miami getting out to a big lead .,sport
tennessee obviously being alabama recently theyve been good .,sport
i think this year we are going to see we might see some more upset and we might see some more interesting matchup in this college football playoff .,sport
and again shout out to team .,sport
we might see some fun team too .,sport
iowa state might get in from out of the big 12th .,sport
we might see indiana get in potentially a a non they are not going to win the big ten but they could still jump in and fully summarize and conclude this argument that ive been to .,sport
not a real argument but point out i am making .,sport
think goodness that we ditched the stupid east west north south all that dumb division .,sport
because now it is the two best team .,sport
whoever the two top team in the conference play during the conference championship make thing much nicer .,sport
trust me a a big ten i saw who from the big ten region it wa frustrating to be ohio state penn state michigan state michigan one of those team .,sport
who are you guy playing ?,sport
it is northwestern for the one year .,sport
they are good .,sport
it is iowa and then iowa get blown out because they can not keep up offensively .,sport
finally it is we are doing top two team in the conference play turn the conference championship game which i am a massive fan of .,sport
i am very glad that .,sport
i havent been too happy with how region have shifted or not region based with conference but i am at least happy that the two top team in the conference will be playing each other in the conference championship game .,sport
i think thats that make sense to me .,sport
and then you could potentially get michigan ohio state again which would be insane for example .,sport
yeah i one hundred agree with that .,sport
and i want to talk about some other team that are not in the top twelve and probably will end up there .,sport
that team is it is such an interesting team .,sport
such an interesting story .,sport
having your quarter back be not not only not mormon but being jewish .,sport
and then this entire trend starting with byu it is quite funny to watch indiana is one hell of a story .,sport
parma french but wow thats a fun .,sport
it is a fun team to watch .,sport
they are a scoring juggernaut .,sport
speaking of scoring juggernaut boise state .,sport
look boise state may have not had the hardest schedule out here .,sport
but ash and jetty is the i do not even know how to explain it .,sport
he is freaking good .,sport
david is he your husband ?,sport
david do you think he is he your husband ?,sport
yeah i think he is .,sport
i think he carrying this team .,sport
yeah i think he above everyone .,sport
ive seen the espn poll they put out once a week where it is who your husband winner and tim ?,sport
and then you have carson back and you have miami square back when blanking on now what his name is .,sport
but anyways you have a couple of player .,sport
and it is always sixty seventy percent of the fan are saying give jayne to the heisman because he you might be exactly .,sport
it is one thousand one hundred yard .,sport
thats solid .,sport
but then you realize he played a full game of football .,sport
he doing minus one game because theyve been taking him out because he blowing out team .,sport
boise state blow out team in the first half and then they pull .,sport
yeah if he wa playing these game full sixty minute his number will look even more ridiculous .,sport
hed be over one thousand five hundred yard and all good which is you .,sport
yes you can make the argument that he playing in fear inferior competition .,sport
but you got to give prop for it .,sport
he putting a video game number and cc and you can make the argument there is le competition but i do not see any other running back in the big west .,sport
doing anything close to what jayne is doing this year .,sport
it is it is crazy .,sport
and can we mention he put a hundred ninety two yard .,sport
he rushed a hundred ninety two yard on oregon which is considered i guess the best team now in the cultural .,sport
i guess according to ranking this guy is having a reggie bush campaign and the fact is and the sad fact is rafi we both know he not going to win the heisman ?,sport
it is going to go to some qb .,sport
and i do not know who it is going to be whether it is carson beck or when you were or whatnot but it suck .,sport
it is sad to see .,sport
it is great .,sport
for all the worst game now .,sport
ill first crack myself .,sport
it wa the not the big west .,sport
it wa the mountain west .,sport
but yeah i completely agree because .,sport
but i also say to these quarterback havent been too impressive this year .,sport
i havent been blown away by any of these quarterback .,sport
and there no wide receiver putting up the number we saw from devonta smith when he won the heisman marvin harrison jr. when he been in consideration .,sport
if there is any year to give it to a nonpower five player i think this might be the year for jainty entirely .,sport
and i hope that we get boise state a the nonpower five nonpower fourteen in the college football lab this year .,sport
i hope that they put the boise state in because then well get an idea of jainty you are you are ready .,sport
i am not on in zorgan but theys another top ten school in the country .,sport
another solid defense in all that good .,sport
and let see how he doe because it is crazy to say that .,sport
i genuinely think that he having a saquon barclay type of year .,sport
i do not think he going to go a high a saquon barclay did .,sport
again this is bijan robin .,sport
yeah it would have to be .,sport
i feel there no other way of going around it .,sport
but yeah rafi this ha been some exciting exciting football .,sport
i know ive said it before but to say it again college football it is nothing else .,sport
nothing else it .,sport
we do need to talk about nfl rafi .,sport
and two is coming back this week .,sport
dolphin should be always somewhat back .,sport
the bonte is on the jet and they still stink .,sport
and yeah rafi how you feeling ?,sport
also what a robbery from the from by the ref of the white of the viking the other day sorry i am tripping over my word .,sport
it is bizarre what happened .,sport
that wa a clear face mask call .,sport
i do not know how you can not see that either way .,sport
i think i think the viking coach handled it .,sport
when he mentioned that it wa clear clear face mask but we shouldnt have been in that position to lose the game .,sport
and the viking are a very good team .,sport
the ram are a good team .,sport
and i hope sam donald get paid very soon or get paid over this off season because he been balling also .,sport
it is from jefferson .,sport
thats my review on this past .,sport
at least past thursday night game and a few other thing to mention but rafi you got anything else you want to talk about nfl or anything that you whats the biggest what team worry you ?,sport
i know we talked about this last week some team i worry you whether they are going to be able to make it in playoff a week later are there any team you are excited about after what you saw this past week ?,sport
yeah honestly i am pretty concerned about the saint at this point .,sport
and i think most people are with the saint .,sport
and i think now in my mind i think the saint being the saint two and a start said more about the panther and cowboy being displaying this year being quite bad .,sport
more than it wa the saint offense this amazing thing .,sport
the saint are amazing .,sport
they are such a great team et cetera .,sport
they are leading everything in offense .,sport
i think that two thing can be true .,sport
the saint are not the team that won those first two game .,sport
they are not a good a that team .,sport
those that team point .,sport
but they are also not a bad a the buccaneer putting up fifty one point on them .,sport
and then givante williams running for what fell at least two hundred yard on the saint for not this past thursday but the thursday before in champagne revenge game on the saint .,sport
i think that there a variety of factor .,sport
obviously derek hart ha been out the past two week and spencer reller did not do a terrible job versus tampa but obviously you still lost by three touchdown .,sport
and then this past game versus the bronco he wa there wa nothing .,sport
and you also have rashid rahid shahid who now out for the year .,sport
we got injured in that tampa game .,sport
and then crystal lavigat concussed a in the game versus tampa very early in that game and missed the bronco game due to a short week .,sport
and then he did not clear the pressure protocol and camero every week .,sport
it is something new with him .,sport
he ha a rib injury .,sport
he ha hand injury .,sport
he been also he hasnt been fully one hundred .,sport
i think the injury have completely derailed them offensively .,sport
and crystal lavigat is coming back this week .,sport
derek hart should be back the next week .,sport
they are slowly starting to get more and more healthy .,sport
obviously you are not going to get should eat back unfortunately this year .,sport
i think the saint again they are not a good a they were when they won those two game .,sport
they are not a good a we think they thought they were .,sport
but they are also i do not think they are a bad a theyve been for the past five game .,sport
i think they are somewhere in between .,sport
but regardless i think the team not a playoff team .,sport
yeah i think i am going to agree with you on there .,sport
i think that the jaguar i think doug merone pushed off another week that he doesnt get fired .,sport
this patriot team i am going to say i am worried about the patriot .,sport
and the reason why i am going to say this is what every other sport pun ha been saying this past week .,sport
you do not call your team soft on national television .,sport
yes the team hasnt been playing .,sport
maybe they havent been putting enough effort but you call the team soft in the locker room not out in the medium .,sport
and thats why bill balachrak tom brady julian ellman have all spoken out against jared not julian ellman devin mccordy have all spoken out against jared mayer because thats not that thats not the patriot way .,sport
and thats not not the patriot way .,sport
thats not what a coach doe .,sport
you take accountability .,sport
and thats not what he did .,sport
he blamed it all on the player .,sport
and i want to say drake may ha been doing amazing .,sport
and he is a clearly wa a top three pick .,sport
i am going to run through stats with you real quick rob because look against the texan two hundred forty three yard three touchdown against the jaguar two hundred seventy six yard two touchdown .,sport
he going for over five hundred yard and five touchdown in this in the in all the other game that he been starting .,sport
this guy is playing great for a rookie .,sport
and it is sad that the medium came and paid attention to that because we have a stupid head coach who calling the team soft instead of addressing it within the locker room .,sport
you clearly i am passionate about this .,sport
and the reason why i am passionate about it is because a a patriot fan i understood that this wasnt going to be the year we go to the super bowl .,sport
i understood to an extent that we will not be a good a we will not be very good that we might finish under five hundred .,sport
but what ive been seeing from this patriot team is not it .,sport
the defense the defense wa amazing last year .,sport
we have a defensive minded coach .,sport
it is still the same defensive game plan youd think but it is clearly not showing up .,sport
the patriot have a very simple operator very simple defense .,sport
they have that done that for year .,sport
and it seems they can not even execute the simple thing .,sport
and i blame that on the coaching not the player .,sport
very very passionate rant .,sport
and i do think that there some reasoning to believe question the coaching especially a you said they return essentially the same player on defense .,sport
and it is there no difference in system .,sport
gerard mayo ha been in the patriot .,sport
he essentially been incubated for this season to where the belichick is belief it wa duty .,sport
gerard mayo you ready now everything you have everything settled .,sport
the only player that they lost with matthew judon and he hasnt done too much with the falcon this year from a past perspective .,sport
you can make the argument that with his injury history etc .,sport
they did not lose too much .,sport
and yeah it is i think the biggest shock to me is the defense .,sport
i agree with you .,sport
i think we all expected the patriot offense and not be good this year .,sport
drake may have stepped in and played these past two week in his first two game .,sport
i do not think he been insane by all mean but he been a kickback .,sport
but what ?,sport
he been pretty solid .,sport
he id say he played better in his first two game and kail williams it in his first two game .,sport
i think he off to a good start .,sport
and you have some piece you have tomorrow douglas you have also tight end hunter henry rodney stevenson is a guy who show up some week .,sport
doesnt show up other week .,sport
thats a whole other thing that we get into .,sport
but yeah thats a whole other thing .,sport
i definitely question the coaching .,sport
i personally think that it is best to see it out for the year and see what happens .,sport
i personally and this is not coming from a hater perspective .,sport
this is a no buy perspective .,sport
i think id to at least see two year before i this because i think people in the nfl it is such a demanding result business where it is we need to see result away .,sport
i think you give them next year a . give them an off in our off season .,sport
if thing are still off the rail for the patriot then it is a bit of a concern if you get some more if you get an offensive weapon or two for drake may and this is the same result .,sport
then i start to question his coaching a a whole .,sport
and yeah the defense is thats been the back one of the patriot over the past couple of year even in the twilight year of tom brady time there .,sport
tom brady wasnt at the top of this game but you knew that the patriot were going to be a top five ten defense in the nfl .,sport
and we are going to keep similar to what the steelers are now .,sport
but the patriot offense wa still a little better than what the steelers offense is .,sport
it is definitely some red alarm overall for the new patriot .,sport
and on our team too sevegan team the patriot in tom brady final year .,sport
they put on a pretty good performance overall beating the jet by what is it twenty two point three score .,sport
and the jet were coming off a bad loss to the bill .,sport
and it wasnt bad in the sense that they got blown out .,sport
it wa a close loss .,sport
but the kicking situation completely derailed them .,sport
they had they left nine point on the table .,sport
the offense wasnt able to still do much which set up gregs airline to keep missing field goal in the first place .,sport
and it felt they let that game get away from them at the end of the day where they had their chance but couldnt capitalize .,sport
and you pick up devante adam you expect the team to yes the steelers are a good defense but you the jet that put up fifteen point is thats thats you can not be having that happen to get shut out in the second half .,sport
devante adam and gary wilson were both semiinvolved in the offense .,sport
breeze hall wa great for the most part .,sport
i think breeze hall is probably the biggest winner of the devante adam trade because i think it opened up his ability to run and a a passing option .,sport
but this felt a big game for the jet and the jet proceeded to a theyve normally done in the past jet it up .,sport
and if they if they somehow lose no offense if they somehow lose to the patriot this weekend what do you do at that point ?,sport
you fired the head coach already .,sport
you brought in devante adam you made a big swing you picked up another guy who retread packer a tradition .,sport
if the jet lose to the patriot then there serious problem .,sport
and the schedule doesnt get any better for the jet .,sport
they have the texan a week after .,sport
the season do not get that long .,sport
they play the cardinal too which cardinal have been up and down but the cardinal are still good you might say .,sport
then you play the colt .,sport
essentially when that game seahawks depends what week you get .,sport
you play the dolphin twice and tuas back .,sport
hopefully it is healthy .,sport
you play the jaguar but then you play the ram and bill too .,sport
if the jet are two and five they can not be afforded to pick up any more loss .,sport
and they do not have a luxury of having an easy schedule the rest of the year .,sport
and they do not have the luxury of coasting .,sport
their defense you should not be giving up thirty seven point .,sport
i know russell wasnt in a good game but you should not be giving up thirty seven point to the pittsburgh steelers .,sport
thats completely unacceptable for a team the jet with quote unquote super bowl aspiration .,sport
i completely agree with you there rafi .,sport
and i think i want to switch over to talk about some hype from some key game of the week i think that can dictate the rest of the season .,sport
first off and that doesnt dictate the rest of the season but i think it is big to see bear commander one versus two .,sport
the number for two .,sport
but what david here ill ill cut you off real quick to mention this game .,sport
if i am dan quinn if i am the commander i know zardyne gano is in this game .,sport
even if he he been living in practice this week i personally i am this you are ready .,sport
you are playing with cash money .,sport
jen daniel ha been great this year .,sport
you have you have five win which i did not even think they were going to potentially even get to five win this year .,sport
you are at five win on the year .,sport
take your time with the rookie quarterback .,sport
it is .,sport
let him sit out this week .,sport
let mark mario to play .,sport
he mark mario to hold it down .,sport
it wa first to panther .,sport
mark mario to i do not want him playing the rest of the year .,sport
he is not that guy but for another week i think you can throw him out there versus the bear and feel semi he could potentially pull off a win here .,sport
and the worst thing you can do is a jane daniel is not a hundred percent is throwing them back out there .,sport
and if he get reinjured god forbid or something happens then it is the whole season completely derailed .,sport
have him say what ?,sport
we want you to be fully healthy .,sport
we want you to be ready to go .,sport
he run the ball .,sport
he run quite a bit too .,sport
it is stay healthy .,sport
take the week off .,sport
we are fully recovered .,sport
and then you are all ready for the rest of the year .,sport
i learned from the past .,sport
learn from the past .,sport
thats all i got to say now .,sport
look i do agree with the learning from the past .,sport
i am going to slightly disagree with that .,sport
i think you should be an emergency backup .,sport
because i think that their schedule is not bad .,sport
do not get me wrong but because you play the giant they play the giant the week after the steelers which is a good team but you have the steelers eagle cowboy the end of the season is also not too bad .,sport
i think that this is an important game i think for them to win and put a big difference between them and the rest of the nfc east .,sport
and because of that i think that he should play maybe the second half or be very limited in gameplay .,sport
but i agree to disagree .,sport
i do not think we could go .,sport
i do not think we need to argue about that .,sport
but another game i think that should be talked about .,sport
there two of the other game .,sport
colt texan and falcon buck .,sport
you did not say the game i wa thinking about. . this will be fun .,sport
let me talk about falcon buck buccaneer .,sport
and the reason because this game is important because you beat the buccaneer you almost you do not clinch the division but you come very very close to ?,sport
because the only other threat to the falcon and the nfc south is the buccaneers. ?,sport
you beat them here .,sport
you mean that mean you swept them this entire season .,sport
and then the falcon got the cowboy the saint bronco all three team ive been struggling .,sport
and and then it is smooth cruising after that .,sport
other than the charger and viking you end off the season with the raider giant commander which that could be a tough game and the panther .,sport
they could the falcon could position themselves if they win this week .,sport
and thats why i think it is a huge game for them in term of the .,sport
also real quick to chime in they are three and also far into the division .,sport
if they go to four and o then they are looking good .,sport
and thats been one of the fall season of past falcon team aside from obviously terrible quarterback playing arthur smith deciding to have the backup tight end throw a pas on the one yard line .,sport
giving the ball to vijon robinson .,sport
sorry ptsd .,sport
they are winning these conference game .,sport
and if thats something that they did not do in year past they did not have a good enough conference record .,sport
theyd drop one to the panther somehow .,sport
the little always split with the saint .,sport
the buccaneer past year they were getting swept by the bucs too .,sport
to be three and o and potentially to go to four and o i think thats absolutely massive for the falcon to build up that lead on the division but continue on .,sport
i think what this quote it is a very pivotal game for them .,sport
if you do not beat the texan joe flacco the texan have it is joe flacco season .,sport
that is me .,sport
the texan go two game on above you ?,sport
and then your rest of the season schedule is it is not bad but it is not great either .,sport
you play the viking bill lion and bronco .,sport
beyond that yeah their schedule get a bit easier because they have the jet on their schedule the patriot the giant the jag the titan .,sport
to an extent their schedule is fairly easy but at the same time you want to win the division ?,sport
and you do not want to play be put into a wild card race .,sport
and thats why i think this is such a big game for them for the colt for the texan .,sport
look same they are in the same position a the buccaneer which i already explained .,sport
those are my highlight of the game of the week key game to watch .,sport
raffi what are yours ?,sport
david real quick do you start jill flacco this week versus texan ?,sport
because anthony richardson wa very hyped going through the season .,sport
we saw the flash of the first four game before he got put out for the year .,sport
unfortunately got injured and wa out for the year last year .,sport
and there high expectation .,sport
and he ha currently three touchdown six interception under eight hundred yard .,sport
he ha an a qbr of forty three .,sport
and i know qbr is in the biggest .,sport
it is not a directly a quarterback stack and to the team too .,sport
but he ha not been good this year .,sport
he having a massive i guess you can call it a sophomore slump .,sport
but i say it wa more this would be the midway point of his rookie year .,sport
he played essentially seven eight game .,sport
he got injured a this year earlier on .,sport
and do you start joe flacco in this game ?,sport
because joe flacco hasnt been bad .,sport
and once again we saw what he did last year but .,sport
you can not keep rolling out joe flacco .,sport
can i deal with world ?,sport
yes you can continue rolling him out .,sport
but at the end of the day anthony richardson won them the game last week .,sport
i do not see how you yeah i wasnt pretty against the dolphin but i do not see how you can bench him i think .,sport
but it wa the coolest toughens and they won sixteen to ten .,sport
it is you can not .,sport
what it doesnt .,sport
that doesnt .,sport
that will kill his look it is the same way you bench bryce young there you can not do that to a qb .,sport
and unless he get injured or they say hey we want you to rest a bit more .,sport
i tell the doctor to give him some a note .,sport
other than that i feel you need to roll him out .,sport
yes joe flacco played .,sport
we also did not play amazing .,sport
they only put up twenty point on the titans. . i feel yes joe flacco played fairly .,sport
he did his job but i can not argue for anthony richardson to be benched .,sport
very fair .,sport
well move into the game that i want to talk about in the game .,sport
i am very surprised that you did not mention cowboy 49ers .,sport
this is a massive game for both team .,sport
and i think .,sport
both team can not afford to lose this game .,sport
the niner especially where it is christian mccaffrey .,sport
is he going to come back after the buy ?,sport
thats a big .,sport
everyones saying he is .,sport
i get mixed vibe because we went from you should be good for week one two .,sport
he dealing with a little bit of an injury too .,sport
yeah he going to be out for the next month .,sport
and now it is yeah he going to be back after the buy .,sport
we ramped up quickly the ten plus week for mccaffrey to be out for .,sport
and even when he going to come back we discussed this last week .,sport
he probably going to be playing mostly receiving in the receiving game .,sport
you lost brandon iu for the rest of the year .,sport
and the rest of the season for the 49ers they can off if they fall to three and five they lose this game to dallas .,sport
you not only have to deal with dallas fan and them pretending their delusion of thinking that they are going to go to the super bowl .,sport
and then you have the fact that they are going to be happy because the yankee and dodger one of them is going to win the world series which is great for cowboy fan .,sport
but the niner the rest of the season is then you have tampa bay seattle green bay buffalo chicago ram dolphin lion cardinal .,sport
this is the injury .,sport
the injury are ramping up .,sport
it destroyed the roster for the 49ers .,sport
they can not lose this game if they go to three and five .,sport
thats you can still make playoff with seven eight loss .,sport
thats the benefit of having a seventeen playoff .,sport
but if the niner lose this game you are injured to heck him back .,sport
but you can not drop this game .,sport
this is a must win game for them .,sport
and then cowboy too .,sport
micah parson is out again .,sport
dexter lawrence is not playing you are still losing .,sport
you are two top player on defense on the back end .,sport
the running game ha been rico dalville is in solid .,sport
he doesnt make anything special .,sport
i do not know whats going on with him .,sport
he wa brought into the cowboy but i do not think he played even a snap for them .,sport
and that press ha had a terrible year far .,sport
if the cowboy lose this game youd have to imagine mike mccarthy is going to get fired shortly at some point maybe not immediately but he definitely on his way out this year .,sport
it is a terrible season for cowboy .,sport
and if the niner lose this game then you are already injured .,sport
do you even play with chris mcafrey ?,sport
if you drop another game or two if you drop the next week game before the buy and you go to three and six do you even play chris mcafrey this year ?,sport
do you punt on the season ?,sport
i think this is a this ha massive playoff implication massive job implication .,sport
and we are only this is only week eight .,sport
but i think this is this will dictate both team trajectory for the rest of the year .,sport
yeah i agree with that .,sport
i did not even think about this game .,sport
but yeah this is huge for both team and it is prime time .,sport
well see under the light and itll be fun to watch .,sport
i think both team havent been doing great but i think both team can put up a show .,sport
and i think thatll do it then for this edition of the benchro and sport podcast .,sport
a always be sure to this video subscribe to our channel a . follow u on tiktok benchro and our understable support .,sport
and yeah let u know about these big game .,sport
well see what happens .,sport
well be sure to discus it in the coming week a . let u know you think in the comment below and have a good one .,sport
qa review celebrating forty year of audio production welcomed you to this week edition of the glasgow time sport podcast recorded from our studio in the bishop riggs medium centre and by our volunteer working from home .,sport
leipzig star reckons team will struggle at celtic park report by mark walker r.b .,sport
you are watching the adc sport podcast on youtube .,sport
the show start now .,sport
welcome to episode thirteen of the adc sport podcast .,sport
my name is sam frick founder and editor at around the northeast corner covering thirty school across northeast indiana and part of elkart county .,sport
that includes the adc the acac and the northeast aid .,sport
and the first week of the football sectional are completed .,sport
the regional section of volleyball ha been completed .,sport
cross country is now into it final week of the season a the state final will take place on saturday .,sport
and exactly one week from now the first official week of the two thousand and twenty fourtwo thousand and twenty five high school girl basketball season .,sport
college basketball is already underway across the nation .,sport
and we are not too far off from basketball becoming a everyday talk here at around the northeast corner .,sport
and well talk about basketball especially next week a i will have some guest on basketball to preview some of the opening game coming up that week .,sport
but without further ado let go ahead and discus the football aspect of the state tournament .,sport
and fremont came back led by colton armstrong three rushing tds and the fremont eagle defeat the norse by the score of thirty five to twenty one .,sport
and now the fremont eagle find themselves in a very interesting position playing in the sectional semifinal for the first time in a long time at fremont first time since two thousand and eighteen that fremont is playing in the second round of the sectional tournament .,sport
theyll take on a very strong north miami team thats eight and two on the season .,sport
they defeated the black hawk christian in their very first postseason appearance fifty four to fourteen .,sport
i will discus more in detail about those matchup in a later video but congratulation to fremont on their first round win in the playoff for football .,sport
1a forty four south adam cruised to the fifty one to nothing win over the union city indian .,sport
they are going to be traveling down south to try high school .,sport
theyll take on a very good try tightens team that like to run the football .,sport
and this will be the acac game of the week at around the northeast corner south adam looking to punch their ticket to the sectional championship game that sweet .,sport
also by the way madison grant did defeat monroe central .,sport
they are seeing the favorite in that sectional .,sport
they defeated monroe central thirty eight to seven .,sport
they are going to be taking on hanger town madison grant seen a the heavy favorite to win that matchup there a a winning the sectional altogether .,sport
you look at 2a sectional thirty five adam central cruised to the thirty five seven win over bluffton matt heiser with a touchdown and then cameron frable having a strong game defensively of course .,sport
and then jameson rose the quarterback to the bottom of adam central combined for three touchdown total and that win over the bluffton tiger .,sport
they are going to be hosting the cherubusco eagle .,sport
they were down twenty three to twenty early in the game .,sport
they came back to score twenty two on answer .,sport
and they came back to beat the manchester squire the home team in that contest by the score of forty two to twenty three .,sport
angelou iniceli is one of the nominee for the performer of the week at around the northeast corner for football .,sport
he had twenty five carry for two hundred and twenty six yard and three tds .,sport
two catch for fourteen yard and additional touchdown in that win over the squire .,sport
busco is going to have to play their best football going to the landing strip in a row down in adam county to take on the threetime rainstay finalist the adam central flying jet .,sport
you then have eastside defeating whitco thirty five to seven off of the tremendous performance by joe richmond of eastside nine carry for one hundred and twenty six yard and three for ninety yard with three touchdown in that win over the wildcat .,sport
they are going to travel to prairie height .,sport
they are going to be taking on the weedah height weedah height of prairie however you want to call them prairie height panther .,sport
five and five on the season .,sport
they already had the most win in a single season .,sport
since two thousand and thirteen and prairie height is one win away from their most win in a season since one thousand nine hundred and eighty six when they won seven game that year .,sport
i will be discussing this season of prairie height football with your head coach pat mccray later in the show .,sport
but prairie height will be hosting that matchup against the eastside blazer .,sport
and then you look at three ace sectional twenty six garrett cruz to the fifty to twenty six win over lakeland three player rushed for one hundred yard alex guzman cam rubel and calder .,sport
hefty also threw for about i believe it wa eighty nine past yard or something that .,sport
and a pair of touchdown for the garrett railroader a they will be traveling to death valley to take on the tippie valley viking who dominated the woodland warrior fifty one twenty five seventy three tippie valley hosting ten and zero garrett .,sport
and that will be the necc game of the week at around the northeast corner .,sport
west noble dominate and goal forty two to fourteen led by seth carrute .,sport
once again leading the way for the charger backfield twenty two carry for one hundred and forty three yard two touchdown and he became the career rushing leader in the history of west noble high school for rushing yard .,sport
he ha over one thousand six hundred rushing yard going into this week .,sport
and anytime you play a rivalry game in the postseason it amplifies thing a little bit more between these two rival that clearly do not each other whatsoever .,sport
and i think this is gon na be a fun matchup in the near at least at the start well see if fairfield can hang around in this game .,sport
ill get the very good west noble team .,sport
i said earlier with seth pruitt rushing for over fourfive hundred yard going into that matchup and setting the career rushing leader at west noble .,sport
you also have sixty eight career touchdown a . threeeight hundred and twenty eight bishop lure dominated norwell by the score of forty two to seven .,sport
they are going to jay county take on the jay county patriot who defeated belmont forty two to seven .,sport
they had a lineman with a pitch six at jay county that wa austin shaneline .,sport
sorry welcome back .,sport
it appeared at my computer died during the recording .,sport
well go ahead and resume where we left off here .,sport
we talked about three essential twenty eight jay county who faced bishop lure at jay county on friday .,sport
delta defeated the heritage patriot fifty four to fourteen where delta ran i would guess over three hundred yard rushing in that game .,sport
and unfortunately for heritage it seemed they were limping into playoff .,sport
i did not think theyd be limping this much in the playoff but i think in the end they delta simply played better football than the heritage patriot .,sport
thats two year in a row where delta came into the postseason with a mediocre record .,sport
although a very hard conference in the hoosier heritage conference .,sport
and delta is having success far in the state tournament .,sport
mrs. sennewa i can not overlook the delta eagle undefeated mrs. sennewa wa gon na be hosting delta or miss took care of business against okale after a slow first half .,sport
they scored twenty one unanswered in the second half to the beat .,sport
huntington north set a new program record for most point scored in a single game defeating the frankfurt hot dog seventy seveneight .,sport
and the viking now have seven win on the season .,sport
theyll be hosting a five and four marion giant team an underwhelming marion team this season .,sport
and they are one win away from a spot in the sectional final which will be played against either logan sport or lebanon .,sport
huntington north will be on the road no matter who it is .,sport
and logan four and nine and one this season they are coming off a thirty fivethirteen one over muncie central .,sport
probably gon na be underdog in this matchup against lebanon who came back from an early deficit to defeat culver canemies in the fourth quarter .,sport
thirty fivethirty two culver canemies wa seen a probably the slight favorite to even win that sectional .,sport
and now lebanon the tiger of lebanon have a chance to play for a sectional championship .,sport
and for the lebanon tiger only one sectional championship in their entire history .,sport
it go all the way back to one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven .,sport
it is been a long time coming for the tiger and for huntington north fan huntington north with their best season since the two thousand and eight campaign at least .,sport
and huntington north one sectional title a coming all the way back to one thousand nine hundred and ninety three .,sport
we could see a pleasant regional bound team in coming out of this sectional over the next couple of week .,sport
and then we look at for a sectional nineteen to wrap thing up in football coverage .,sport
east noble took care of business against southside by the score of forty fiveseven in kinderville dylan krell once again doing dylan krell thing a he had ten carry for one hundred and sixty four yard and three tds .,sport
that is for all you math folk out there .,sport
there sixteen.four yard for kerry for dylan krell .,sport
and east noble is gon na get that rematch against leo lyon at lyon field .,sport
that is going to be the anec game of the week at around the northeast corner a east noble set to embark on their rematch from week number five where east noble defeated leo thirty fivetwenty nine .,sport
a key matchup that ultimately decided the northeast state in favor of the east noble knight winning the conference to themselves .,sport
east noble looking for their first sectional championship two thousand and twenty leo looking to repeat for the first time since two thousand and eleven for football and they will in the winter that matchup will face either bishop dwainier or the wayne general .,sport
and if wayne win in that matchup against dwainier wayne will be the visiting team in the sectional final at either east noble or leo .,sport
if dwainier win this matchup against wayne dwainier will be the host of this sectional championship .,sport
dwainier coming off of thirty eightnothing went over columbia city .,sport
columbia city columbia city season end at eight and two .,sport
dwainier won thirty eightnothing which i think a lot of u did not expect it to be that lopsided although we expected dwainier to be in this game and i did predict dwainier to advance .,sport
thats not super surprising by the outcome but i think the score wa a little bit more surprising than i think most people anticipated .,sport
and then wayne took care of business against new haven but the general are going to have their hand full against dwainier a team that they did not play this season .,sport
in fact they have not played bishop dwainier in the regular season since before the division were implemented .,sport
now let go ahead and shift over to volleyball over the weekend on saturday .,sport
volleyball regional saturday took place across the entire state of indiana and unlike past year this year wa the first year with a new format for volleyball .,sport
it is pretty similar to the basketball baseball softball state format where you have the one game regional and then you have the two game semistate .,sport
this past weekend wa the one game regional .,sport
we had a few school from the aac area that competed on saturday .,sport
well go ahead and start with the acac and well begin with newcastle and heritage .,sport
heritage unfortunately saw their season coming to an end at the hand of the newcastle trojan a twenty fivewin newcastle team to which newcastle swept the heritage patriot twenty fivetwenty two twenty fivenineteen and twenty sixtwenty four .,sport
heritage had an opportunity to even win this match but in the end newcastle a little bit better that day .,sport
newcastle will be part of this 3a semistate that well talk about in another video .,sport
a far a woodland concerned they did take care of business in the regional and woodland remains undefeated all the time against regional competition three straight sorry not three straight sectional title three sectional title three regional championship for the first time since two thousand and thirteen .,sport
woodland is going to semistates .,sport
i am not one hundred sure but that wa a different format at the time and there wa no semistate back then in two thousand and seven where you had regionals and then you go to the state final which wa semifinal and then the real state final .,sport
woodland i believe wa part of it at one point .,sport
woodland took care of business against lakeland .,sport
they won this match three set to one .,sport
i believe the first set wa twenty five to seventeen .,sport
second set went to lakeland twenty fivetwenty two .,sport
woodland took the final two set twenty fivetwenty and fifty fiveten unless anderson continues to lead the way of the woodland warrior i believe she had over twenty kill in that match .,sport
i think you look at even other player in that matchup that contribute for woodland .,sport
obviously you look at kenna smith at labarrell played a monster game on defense for the woodland warrior .,sport
the front row wa awesome against lakeland especially down the stretch .,sport
you look at a player let see katie bottom the sophomore some big kill down the stretch to seal the deal against the lakeland lakers .,sport
hallardsjackway and defensive specialist had a big game a . i looked at again the front row had a monster game against lakeland .,sport
and now woodland ha the opportunity to get to the safe file .,sport
well talk about woodland semistate matchup in a separate video .,sport
we take a look at the northeast corner conference .,sport
the nea obviously did not have any team advancing past sectional .,sport
it wa the acac and the necc and the only other two member from the necc that played .,sport
fremont played south newton in the regional final .,sport
i believe they were at laporte .,sport
and unfortunately for the fremont eagle they were unable to come back from an o2 deficit and they fell in four set at the hand of south newton .,sport
the rebel of south newton they took the first two set twenty fiveeighteen and twenty fivetwenty two .,sport
fremont took the third set twenty fivefifteen but fell short in set four twenty fivetwenty .,sport
you look at south newton statistically they were led by the central michigan commit taylor creight with twenty two kill on forty seven hitting .,sport
she had three ace two blot seven dids .,sport
you also look around this south newton team number nineteen for them and that is briley iceminger with nineteen dids .,sport
they had a couple of girl with three blot on this south newton team a couple of girl in double figure including number twenty two the freshman jada creight with twelve kill and another senior madison bullinger with ten kill .,sport
and unfortunately for fremont that mean the end of high school valuable career for addy parr for claire folt who going to st. francis for delaney bach and for millenia miller at least i might be blanking one more name .,sport
i think they also have lexi stevens who also a senior and she play on the softball team at fremont .,sport
yeah thats the defensive specialist who you are talking about outside hitter libero defensive specialist another outside hitter slash defensive specialist a a their center claire folt .,sport
they do return some piece back including i would say kaylee neuensschwander would be a one to keep an eye on net season for the fremont eagle .,sport
i looked at maybe play mallory huffnagle huffnagles are pretty known athlete at fremont .,sport
emma crager their center defense specialist who only a sophomore .,sport
i look at her for a potential emergence chloe verden .,sport
they are a sophomore defense specialist another one and then hardly wise another middle who a junior this season .,sport
but obviously it is been a little bit different net season for fremont volleyball but no le the first ever sectional championship in the history of fremont volleyball and they came two set shy of winning their first ever regional .,sport
but thankfully for the folk in angola they were able to take care of business but it did require some drama some stress and some five set and a five set throw .,sport
and a five set thriller .,sport
west lafayette took the first set twenty fivenineteen angola took the next two set twenty fiveeighteen and twenty fivetwelve .,sport
ill be speaking with the two harris sister at angola ava harris the senior center maya harris the junior outside hitter both player committing at the highest level division one athletics .,sport
once their endola high school career come to an end we will be speaking with those two harris sister about this season up to this point a a that regional championship game .,sport
they will be taken on hammond bishopknoll at plymouth on saturday .,sport
i will be talking about the semistate pairing in a separate video .,sport
and then lastly i do wan na make sure i address the ihswa cross country regionals a the two regionals we primarily focus on around the northeast corner .,sport
they take place at new prairie and new haven .,sport
well make this one pretty short for new prairie because i think only a handful of them were able to advance to state or cross country .,sport
one thing i will say for the boy section at new prairie noah bond trader of the westview warrior successfully won a regional championship at a time of fifteen minute and thirteen second .,sport
i am not sure how i remembered it fluently but here i am with my awesome photo memory remembering all the statistic and whatnot and also evan corle of fairfield placed 12th in that regional at new prairie .,sport
keep in mind i am not looking at this now .,sport
this is off of memory .,sport
and i will tell you without any doubt those are the only two that i remember advancing to state from that regional .,sport
now a far a the regional hosted by huntington university which technically would be considered to be new haven a the host nevertheless a lot of local kid were able to advance to that regional hosted by huntington university .,sport
well start off with the lady .,sport
kenya leach at columbia city placed third at columbia city .,sport
and thankfully for the team they scored enough .,sport
i think they had about one hundred and three point and they finished third a a team to advance to the state final a a team for the first time since two thousand and ten .,sport
all of the columbia city player on the girl side they are playing in the state final no matter of their placing .,sport
alans freezing of huntington north .,sport
kenya leach is a sophomore freezing also a sophomore .,sport
she finished in fourth place .,sport
rowan norris of leo finished fifth another sophomore .,sport
chloe gibson of east snow will place seventh .,sport
and then senior ashlyn myers of prairie height finished fifteen .,sport
now among those qualifying that on nonqualifying team usually top fifteen it is usually the state final but keep in mind that there are team that finish the top five that do advance no matter what .,sport
there are some player on nonqualifying team that still advance no matter what .,sport
and that would be sophia haslet of lake park group placed 16th .,sport
katie nile of woodland placed 21st .,sport
madison gerber of adam central placed 23rd .,sport
and then abediel ramseyer of lufthin placed 29th .,sport
congratulation to these lady a they advance to the state final hosted by tarot on saturday .,sport
and then on the boy section ryan garcia of new haven placed second .,sport
followed by zinner now of lakewood park at third .,sport
gavin good of columbia city placed sixth .,sport
andrew stronger of si placed eighth .,sport
memphis martin of lakeland placed 10th .,sport
daniel moll of columbia city placed 12th .,sport
cooper enure of angola placed 13th .,sport
and then for those that did not place on top fifteen but still qualified on nonqualifying team kayden clink of angola placed 19th .,sport
the codisprunner of south adam placed 23rd .,sport
gavin cook of angola placed 24th .,sport
and then jude baumgarner of lufthin getting in those last couple of spot at 25th .,sport
they are all going to the state final hosted by tarot .,sport
and this is the final week of the cross country season .,sport
a the fall season start to wrap up .,sport
i lie there is one other thing i do want to make sure i address here and that is soccer .,sport
unfortunately the soccer season did not go a planned for the remaining school that still managed to play in semistate .,sport
well begin with the boy section of the semistate .,sport
and that wa bethany christian .,sport
they went to kokomo .,sport
they took on a very strong eighteenwin covenant christian team despite the fact bethany came in a the defending state champion .,sport
they went to pks in a scoreless regulation scoreless overtime .,sport
and unfortunately for bethany christian covenant christian wa a hair better in the penalty kit .,sport
they defeated bethany fourthree in the pks .,sport
covenant christian will represent northern indiana in class 1a in the state final .,sport
and the bethany christian bruin season come to an end at fourteenfourfour .,sport
one win shy of a trip back to iu indianapolis .,sport
for a state championship .,sport
disappointing a it sound now still a remarkable run for the bethany christian bruin .,sport
and then lastly i wan na mention the westview warrior .,sport
they were they made a trip to south bend st. joseph to take on faith christian a very strong sixteenwin faith christian team .,sport
again the bethany covenant christian boy matchup this matchup on the girl side needed overtime in a scoreless tie .,sport
it looked it may or could have went to penalty kit but unfortunately for westview faith christian wa able to get one look at the net and they converted .,sport
and that wa hannah bolton with the match deciding semistate clinching goal with about a minute twenty six ago in the second overtime off the feed from bailey pati .,sport
and faith christian is going to the state final .,sport
westview once again one game short of their first ever trip to the state final for girl soccer one worthy of note for westview breed corey stopped eighteen of nineteen shot unable to get the job done for the westview warrior .,sport
and the soccer season for two thousand and twenty four and around the northeast corner come to an end .,sport
and that is the talk around the corner .,sport
and now we get to our interview .,sport
i am here with two very talented player on this androle girl volleyball team ava on the maya harris on the left of the screen here .,sport
and lady how are you doing this evening ?,sport
pretty good feeling good .,sport
yeah we came off an exciting night yesterday .,sport
taking the day off but feeling good. . i heard you lady had a lot of fun last night on your way back from southwood .,sport
yes very very much fun .,sport
it wa a very fun bus ride .,sport
it is a lot of music being played and i am getting to go around the mound with everyone there supporting u . it wa great .,sport
before we talk about that regional championship i want to go back to the beginning of the season .,sport
obviously this team ha went through a lot of success over the year especially with morgan gardy and maya ball class coming through .,sport
and they had a lot of success a . couldnt get it done in the regional but youve returned a lot back despite the fact now that your dad and the coach of the androle program became the head coach of the androle .,sport
oyeball stepped down after last season whatnot .,sport
you also still return a lot of senior and talent back from this team .,sport
when did you realize that maybe this year wa the year that maybe this team could do something that no other team at androle ha ever done before ?,sport
i think we knew from the start that we would still be super good this year .,sport
and then throughout the season a we kept putting work in and we saw how much everyone wa determined to get better and wanted to get further than we have in the past it wa a turning point and how we played and how we acted a a team .,sport
and it helped u to get to the point where we are now .,sport
talk about the senior classroom last year compared to this year and how do the lady from each of those class have implemented and impacted the life of you two especially all the other player on the androle team to make the great program that it is today ?,sport
yeah i think the senior from last year obviously it wa a bigger class but also had a few people going on for college level volleyball .,sport
but this year is mainly basketball player plus ava .,sport
but i think they were also very motivated to want to win and they had that drive in them it pushed u to work hard .,sport
i think a the senior class we stepped up and took leadership .,sport
and i think the way we played and acted towards the rest of the team changed than it ha been in the past few year .,sport
talk about the family dynamic with this program especially with you maya and then ava playing alongside you .,sport
ava the majority of your assist come off of maya kill .,sport
maya kill coming off almost ninety nine of all those assist from ava .,sport
talk about that dynamic there .,sport
we played with each other for a many year that i can remember but i guess having that connection work the best .,sport
we know what we need from each other and we know how to push each other to work our hardest .,sport
and it compliment each other and it reflects off of u onto the team and everybody work hard and want to win .,sport
yeah i think being a setter and a hitter we know when each other is down or messing up and what they need to get back to where they should be .,sport
i think that living together and being around each other constantly it help that dynamic a lot .,sport
angle is a better school amongst the school that anc sport cover in this area but when you look at angola in term of dynamic with the athlete and the player provided at angola high school there a lot of small school family field .,sport
and even this program it feel tighter than ever before with this program .,sport
talk about the connectivity and the camaraderie with this program with the angola community .,sport
yeah i think we have a lot of family obviously we are sister and then we have kendall and bailey holman who are sister .,sport
there a lot of family aspect in that but also weve all played with each other since middle school and we played club together .,sport
i think we came together this year and it is more of a family than it ever ha been .,sport
yeah and i feel this year weve worked more a lot on our team chemistry more than we have in the past year .,sport
it is pushed u together and then that reflects off into how we play on the court .,sport
having that family act around each other it help in the volleyball aspect .,sport
quickly before we discus the state term i do wan na ask a curveball question here .,sport
who the most competitive player on the team and who the most loose i guess to say ?,sport
i say one of the most competitive would be bailey .,sport
she get very competitive in the best way possible and she get that energy out on everyone else too to work hard and want to win .,sport
i think shes very competitive and ha that drive in her .,sport
i would say one of the more looser player is lexi .,sport
she obviously doe wan na win a lot but she also ha fun and she brings a lot of light to the team .,sport
and i think thats good balance to have .,sport
yeah the interesting balance of personality certainly is shown with angola over the year and whatnot .,sport
let talk about the state tournament obviously the sectional that your team always in is always the most competitive .,sport
when you bring an east snowball into calve now it make it even more competitive than ever before .,sport
you obviously took care of bishop dwainer in three set three very close set .,sport
you beat concordia in three close set .,sport
obviously you two played a massive role in that a . the regional going into southwood long trip down there to wabash taking a west sloppy .,sport
talk about the pregame vibe going into that matchup down in southwood knowing the history with going to regionals and knowing that this is one game .,sport
when doe dean you win a regional championship ?,sport
yeah i think we were all excited but also nervous at the same time .,sport
we definitely wanted to break the curse of not being able to win a regional .,sport
we were all nervous but i think on the bus ride down we were trying to get hyped up we were playing music and it wa a lot of exciting moment .,sport
and i think that we got our butterfly to fly in formation whereas other people butterfly might have been flying around .,sport
but i think we took our nerve out and used it to our advantage .,sport
and knowing that everyone stepped up and we were able to not be a nervous and reset when we needed to and being able to be mentally tough too .,sport
and i think it help it is experience wa your best friend going in and whatnot .,sport
obviously west lafayette weve heard about their scrappiness on defense and theyve had some player that are senior that were very good this year for the west lafayette red devil .,sport
you were down zeroone that first set fought your way back and then set four come in an opportunity to close set four west lafayette come back .,sport
i think they scored the final three point to force the fifth set .,sport
talk about the transition between set four and five because for those that do not understand volleyball volleyball is very much a momentum sport when especially going from one set to another .,sport
talk about that transition from going from man we could have had set four to let focus on winning set five .,sport
yeah set five is definitely a hard spot to be in .,sport
you never know which way it will go .,sport
and i think our way of thinking of that is the first to five .,sport
we always try to come out on top first get that energy rolling first we can take that momentum into the rest of the set .,sport
yeah definitely set five is probably the most mentally hard and physically set to be in .,sport
it could go anyones way anyone could win that set but yeah it is first to five and who can last the longest and work the hardest .,sport
and it is show because you jumped out to that big that leah they wa five the one at one point set five eight to three at one point then west lafayette and the one back at the you knew it wa gon na happen .,sport
they tied it a and then you came back and you were resilient showing that battle tested work all season long that value amount and the quality of work that showed over the year finally paid off .,sport
obviously you had some big play on defense from player anna mcclure and you had kendall holman with big kill and you had lettsy stolman with big kill ava with big time set .,sport
and then obviously the last play of the match ava fittingly cross pas to maya harris to win the regional .,sport
talk about that moment when you realized that this wa over and angola wa a regional champion .,sport
yeah but i think on that last point we knew this is it we are winning this .,sport
and a a setter i always have many option .,sport
and i think that everyone wanted to be the one to get the kill which is great .,sport
but i know maya is always there and shes always ready to put the ball away .,sport
but yeah i think maya told me that one of our player savannah vixler on set fourteen wa shaking and getting emotional because we knew that we were about to win this .,sport
and thats a great feeling to have we know that we have it and we are confident in our ability to win .,sport
yeah it wa a great team effort .,sport
i started with a good serve from bailey and she wa able to get a great dig off it .,sport
and then ava put up a beautiful set and then i put it away .,sport
after that knew wow we did it for the first time ever in history .,sport
and it is a great feeling and it brought up our hope and determination to keep on going in semistate .,sport
this is maya and ava harris of angola .,sport
maya is a junior outside hitter .,sport
ava harris is a senior on this angola team .,sport
before we talk about semistate i do want to mention your future home at the college level .,sport
ava you are going to villanova next year .,sport
maya you are gon na have to wait an extra year .,sport
you are going in two year to illinois in the bay of ten .,sport
obviously being a purdue fan thats exciting there and whatnot .,sport
talk about the valid reason a to why you chose those two program .,sport
illinois ive always wanted to be in the big ten .,sport
it is been a dream since i wa little .,sport
knowing that i had the opportunity it ha me forward to choose them .,sport
but also coaching staff is great .,sport
they have a great team chemistry and they are all one big family .,sport
and thats something that i look forward in a college .,sport
knowing that for the next four year that those are the people i am gon na be around every day .,sport
team and the player and the culture that wa probably my biggest drawboard .,sport
yeah i think for me obviously villanovas a great school with good academic and it is a beautiful campus and a great spot .,sport
but i think what pushed me over the edge when deciding wa when i went and visited there the people were amazing .,sport
the coach were great .,sport
the teammate were great .,sport
and i felt that the people there were very similar to me and i would fit in there .,sport
and they gave me a great opportunity and i am excited to be there next year .,sport
that is for sure .,sport
now we move forward .,sport
and obviously this week is preparation for your team to prepare for a long road trip to plymouth which is over in marshall county .,sport
you are gon na be taking on hammond bish of noel in the 3a semistate .,sport
i believe they arranged one spot ahead of you according to some poll in the state .,sport
while you are ranked seven they are ranked six .,sport
looking at the overall number of bish of noel it seems they do serve the ball very very .,sport
they are also probably scrappy westloth yet .,sport
i would imagine this is probably gon na be another long match a we would expect .,sport
and especially with this being a tworound day in semistate because now it is being reversed to two round i am gon na say to go along with basketball baseball and forth and whatnot .,sport
talk about your early impression with hammond bish of noel and the fact you are gon na be playing a two game potentially a two game semistate .,sport
i think we need to work it out and have that mental and physical stability throughout the whole match .,sport
yeah they are obviously gon na be a good team if they are in this spot .,sport
i think we have to take this week to focus in learn more about them and dial in ourselves a we can prepare to play them on saturday .,sport
very very exciting day no le .,sport
my own question for me obviously you wan na get to the state final in mince indiana .,sport
obviously thats the ultimate goal is playing in one of the greatest venue in all of volleyball in the state of indiana in both state and one at worth and arena .,sport
but now you are making history for the first time in the history of the program .,sport
how would science feel for the community your family the parent the past player to be talking about and goal volleyball doing something that no one ha ever done before ?,sport
yeah it is great .,sport
and it is amazing to be a part of this team that is making history and knowing that our work ha paid off and the community support ha been amazing .,sport
and we have to focus on the next game and our next match .,sport
yeah it is a great feeling to make history for our high school .,sport
but i think it is a great feeling to be able to prove to people that we were capable .,sport
yeah thats for sure .,sport
and for you for david harris for senior ann mcclure bailey holman lettsy stillman kendall holman .,sport
i go down the list across the order .,sport
this program a lot of exciting moment a this school embarks history and unprecedented history no le for female sport at angle high school to be this close to playing for the state file which angle ha never done in a team sport volleyball or basketball or football .,sport
it definitely is a signing time no le to be a part of that opportunity .,sport
maya ava any final thought before i let you go ?,sport
thank you much .,sport
thank you for having u . all that is maya and ava harris of the angle lady hornet a they prepare on historic first semestates a they will take on handish of noel at plymouth high school .,sport
lady thank you for taking the time to talk about the hornet .,sport
and good luck this week .,sport
thank you much .,sport
i am here with the head football coach of the prairie height panther pat mccrae .,sport
coach how are thing going for you and your parent ?,sport
all coach before we talk about this season i do want to talk about your time at prairie height over the year .,sport
this is your ninth season at prairie height .,sport
and when you first came in this is the program that went through a lot of struggle .,sport
i think they were winless at that time and went through a little bit of a losing streak at that point .,sport
coach when you look back between when you first came in a a head football coach to now where have you seen the most improvement with the program especially with the way it is handled with the community aspect of prairie height football ?,sport
a far a the community the prairie height community ha always been great in supporting u and our team even when weve had some struggled year .,sport
theyve always been there in supporting u . but the kid our kid are always blue collar hardworking kid .,sport
and this year it is been fortunate to have a big group of senior .,sport
we have sixteen senior this year .,sport
in high school football especially in small school football it is a number game .,sport
and when you have a lot of kid that help tremendously .,sport
that is for sure .,sport
going into this season obviously this last season for prairie height in two thousand and twenty three your team wa winless .,sport
but it seemed the program wa showing a lot of fight still .,sport
and it seemed a young team wa going to eventually improve going into this season .,sport
talk about the excitement about this year prairie height panther .,sport
i think it left off with last year .,sport
we went into sectional zero and nine and went into central louisville .,sport
they beat u in the regular season last year .,sport
i think it wa fifty five to nothing .,sport
and we went into that game last year .,sport
and we ended up losing fourteen to nothing .,sport
but hat off to our senior that we had last year .,sport
i think that the hard work and determination of them guy is sticking through it with the season .,sport
i think that helped to bleed over into this year and help get our kid started off on a good foot .,sport
and we brought in extra kid who did not play last year from that senior class .,sport
and thats helped a lot .,sport
and a good group of kid this year we started off the season with roster of fifty kid .,sport
and in my tenure at prairie height thats been the most kid weve ever had on roster .,sport
ended that season last year .,sport
wasnt what we wanted what we hoped for last year .,sport
but i think that group of boy who played last year helped build on what we are doing .,sport
and any time you get fifty kid at prairie height for football thats a huge deal .,sport
i remember the day when it used to be maybe getting thirty kid at prairie height wa seen a that wa a big deal .,sport
getting fifty wa thats a tremendous accomplishment for your program at prairie height .,sport
obviously you started the season with a win over witco .,sport
i believe it wa fifty six to fourteen at witco .,sport
and that wa a game where jordan club set the record i believe for reception i believe in a game against witco and whatnot .,sport
and it wa the beginning of something that wa something we have not seen in prairie height in quite some time especially with the threeinone start .,sport
you had klump on that team .,sport
you have other kid on that team a . obviously well talk about matt armstrong in a matter of moment .,sport
but talk about the team resilience and then their depth throughout the lineup where at any given point any of these player could come up with a big play .,sport
yeah thats been a big thing especially i said being a small school and having good number that that help because weve had kid who maybe for a week or have been injured .,sport
weve been able to move other guy in and not necessarily freshman .,sport
in the past weve had low number .,sport
and you get one or two guy hurt .,sport
and then all of a sudden it seems you are starting a bunch of freshman to fill in .,sport
and this year that being that weve had more kid on our roster than ever before since ive been coaching thats been a huge benefit .,sport
when youve had a kid injured we do not have to backfill with freshman .,sport
and some guy that have stepped up this year and then it is been amazing .,sport
connor syesmore he a sophomore started off at the beginning of the year .,sport
he wa injured .,sport
he did not play the wickel game .,sport
i do not believe he played week two either against bronson .,sport
and then connor ha steadily worked his way up and gotten better and better each week .,sport
thats been a good thing for u . and then when you look at the lineup with prairie hide obviously you have some multisport athlete on this team that are experienced especially in wrestling .,sport
one of the top sport at prairie hide is wrestling .,sport
you have the hagewood kid that play both way .,sport
thats a huge deal prairie hide because you always have to play both way on this team .,sport
and then youve got obviously we talked about matt armstrong a dualthread quarterback who can run and throw the football .,sport
he obviously recently set the program for career passing yard at prairie hide which i believe wa previously set by ethan hoover a few year ago at prairie hide .,sport
talk about matt armstrong growth over the year at quarterback that ha helped him become who he is .,sport
and he only a junior by the way .,sport
we did one more year talking about matt armstrong at quarterback .,sport
yeah i think it wa his freshman year .,sport
his first start wa against chere busco .,sport
and that probably couldnt have been a worse situation for him to step into a a starting quarterback .,sport
that wa not one of his best game by far a a quarterback at prairie hide .,sport
but at that time we felt hey we were going to give matt a shot and see where thing could take u . and you are .,sport
matt is a dualthread quarterback .,sport
his rushing yard i think now second on the team in rushing yardage this season .,sport
and i think getting those early start a a freshman ha helped him out a lot a he progressed through last year and this year .,sport
and i think there a lot left on the horizon for him .,sport
that is for sure .,sport
let go ahead and shift towards the sectional game .,sport
obviously after going three and one you had a little bit of a losing streak .,sport
then the big wing against fremont happened in week a. you get some momentum going into sectional .,sport
you drew central noble in the first round .,sport
a team you beat in the regular season this year back in week number four .,sport
you beat central noble twenty six to fourteen .,sport
and again talking about the common theme of prairie hide matt armstrong doe what he doe best throwing the football and running the ball .,sport
you got a balanced rushing attack led by the hagewood kid .,sport
you got some receiver at bound that collectively get their target and whatnot .,sport
talk about the ability to get that win on the road against a central noble team that wa hungry for a win .,sport
and knowing this wa going to be the last game for some of these team at central noble how do you be able to come out and gun out that win against central noble ?,sport
i think that go back to a little bit of history .,sport
and i said last year we went into that sectional one game last year zeronine after central noble beat u in the regular season fifty fivezero .,sport
and our kid went out there and fought to the nail every play .,sport
we ended up losing that game fourteenzero .,sport
and that wa the whole thing i stressed to them last week wa do not count these guy out .,sport
they are going to come out and fight you .,sport
and my message to the team last friday night wa we got forty eight minute to go out and earn a shot at another forty eight minute .,sport
and i wanted them to empty their tank .,sport
and i felt our kid did that .,sport
they went out and they fought back a hard a central noble did fought harder and empty their tank .,sport
and we earned another forty eight minute next week .,sport
that is for sure .,sport
a you looked at prairie height football that wa the 11th postseason win in the history of the program .,sport
thats that make it a little bit more special for the program .,sport
you reach five win for the first time since two thousand and thirteen .,sport
and only i believe it is the third time since one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine .,sport
and i know people are getting tired of hearing that year at prairie height football .,sport
this is a big deal for this program going in the direction .,sport
now you have an opportunity to get a six win .,sport
something that hasnt happened at prairie height since one thousand nine hundred and eighty six .,sport
you are going to play east side .,sport
you are going to be a home in front of your very loyal home crowd at prairie height .,sport
you are going to be hosting east side team that beat you by thirteen point in the regular season .,sport
when you talk about the matchup at the east side and obviously it is going to be harder for east side to win that second game because of how hard it is to beat the same team twice .,sport
talked about the matchup at the east side up front .,sport
talked about that matchup knowing you are not to face joe richmond at quarterback .,sport
and then talked about what are thing that your team is going to have to continue to do to have an opportunity to win this game .,sport
yeah excuse me .,sport
east side is going to be east side .,sport
they are a good football team .,sport
theyve traditionally been a good football team .,sport
and our kid are going to have to work hard .,sport
and if we want to win this game we are going to have to be willing to work harder and them guy and fight harder .,sport
it doesnt matter to me who they got at quarterback .,sport
i know that they are going to be the same east side team .,sport
they to run the football .,sport
they are quarterback no matter who it is .,sport
have always been good at running the football .,sport
and they are they are tough kid and they are tough to be .,sport
and i do not expect anything le from them than weve seen in them in the past .,sport
and coach brandiwes done a good job picking up that program and moving forward .,sport
and we are excited to play them guy at home and looking forward to a good game this friday .,sport
i guess we should be forecasting some hardnosed football on friday are not we ?,sport
yeah i am pretty sure east side going to want to run the football thats for sure .,sport
yeah thats for sure .,sport
final question from me coach .,sport
obviously you are a prairie height guy and this community ha embraced you and your family within the prairie height football program .,sport
the feeder system ha been a big part of prairie height growth over the year .,sport
talk about how appreciated that you feel about being a part of the prairie height family .,sport
a very small community that feel it is a big family over there and brushy prairie and whatnot .,sport
that blue color feel of prairie height ha always resonated with the prairie height community .,sport
talk about how much do you appreciate being a part of that prairie height culture ?,sport
man that mean everything to me .,sport
thats where i grew up .,sport
i remember watching guy when i wa a little kid .,sport
when i wa in kindergarten first grade a lot of the football player used to bail hay from my dad and growing up watching prairie height football .,sport
and then a i came up through the program man i love our community and being a part of it .,sport
when lose or whatever we always have great fan who are there supporting u and wanting our kid to do the best .,sport
and i love prairie height and brushy prairie .,sport
thats a badge of honor for guy me and kid at our school .,sport

we might need you brother .,sport
if you are a intense on the field a you are on the set man we are going to win .,sport
we are sure .,sport
it is a lot of talk going on man .,sport
what year ?,sport
whats out there ?,sport
some of these people saying that we did not do our due diligence doing the draft process .,sport
a whole bunch of crap man .,sport
and i know what ive seen when i watch these game now .,sport
no team pay me what i am saying to scout anything that .,sport
but i think i know the game is good enough to know better what i am saying ?,sport
yeah for sure .,sport
what are you hearing out there brandon ?,sport
pretty much the same thing .,sport
i think we made the decision .,sport
i am not worried about it .,sport
you could see whats being produced out there .,sport
i am pretty comfortable where we are at .,sport
definitely exciting for this game .,sport
a win is always nice .,sport
and we want to keep rolling with that .,sport
pretty excited .,sport
and i am excited about the fact that and i go back from the goat this go to i am going to date myself the michael jordan era where he always wanted to play against your best .,sport
he used to talk trash and he wanted you at your best because he wanted to beat the best version of you .,sport
and thats where i am at today man .,sport
i want the best version of jaden daniel .,sport
i want him out on the field and i want to kick him in his teeth and hit him in his rib .,sport
but yeah i think it is going to be a good game .,sport
i am excited about it man .,sport
it is a pleasure and honor to have you guy on the set .,sport
harris is always looking slick .,sport
i your is that a crucial catch hat ?,sport
nah nah this is a hat i got maybe a year and a half ago. . it is no color .,sport
yeah it is a color wave what i am saying ?,sport
yeah i got mine on from last year .,sport
buddy of mine gave it to me at a tailgate .,sport
i said hey nice hat .,sport
he handed a to me on mine for real .,sport
that wa pretty cool man .,sport
brandon i your number two .,sport
you got over there bro .,sport
thats awesome .,sport
i want to see him show out today .,sport
yeah i think no matter what his number are i feel he will .,sport
and i think he going to do a good job .,sport
what do you guy think his number are going to be ?,sport
while i am sharing our podcast i got my head down .,sport
thats what i do .,sport
once we go live i can start to share to a bunch of other facebook group .,sport
please forgive me but piggyback off of that question and talk between each other .,sport
if i can guess i do not think he going to be overloaded he wa last year with over two hundred plus .,sport
i do not think thats going to be the case because we have much around him .,sport
and i am sure the washington defense is going to be keying on him because he had such an explosion last year .,sport
i feel the wealth is going to get spread around pretty .,sport
a far a dj moore out sixty sixty five anywhere from sixty five to eighty yard in the air a touchdown i feel .,sport
about that brandon are you similar ?,sport
or do you think he going to have a little bit more ?,sport
or whats going on ?,sport
what weve been seeing is kaylas been giving everybody the ball .,sport
but i am thinking dj is going to do a lot better .,sport
i am thinking he going to get two touchdown .,sport
he going to get one hundred yard at least with everyone else producing around him a . but i think in my opinion he going to be the allstar in the field .,sport
for the listener that werent here and me out the other day i to reference a lot of thing to food .,sport
and i feel food and our sport have a lot in common .,sport
thats why tailgate go off .,sport
and there such a joy to be at .,sport
when i wa growing up a lot of boy in the house were all sitting down .,sport
and mom always told me make sure everybodys got a plate .,sport
and we are going to second .,sport
make sure everybodys full .,sport
and then you get into third and whatever .,sport
obviously i had some of them too .,sport
but pay attention to everybody else around you because we do not want anyone to not go without .,sport
and you go with more than your share .,sport
and i think thats where calebs at now man .,sport
he in them shoe where he got a lot of mouth to feed .,sport
and it aint one darius said last year where ive got a select few that i could feed early and often .,sport
but mama might have a little extra big crock pot or something today .,sport
she might be cooking up a little extra .,sport
and you never know who it is going to be .,sport
i agree with darius .,sport
i could see exactly where his logic is at .,sport
but i do i am anticipating potentially something above and beyond that in a streaky situation or something were to happen .,sport
i wouldnt count it out .,sport
but if it doesnt happen to where he exceeds high limit i understand why .,sport
if that make any sense thats where i am thinking .,sport
and i think we can all touch and agree on that .,sport
and thats a good problem to have boy ?,sport
because forever weve always been a brian or a locker or what i am trying to say or i am getting at where you have a few guy .,sport
but then if a guy need to go out for a little bit who do you have to replace ?,sport
i feel good about our squad .,sport
after three year i think pohls put together a good product .,sport
and yeah boy i think today is going to be a fun interesting game .,sport
i am excited about it .,sport
it is going to be one of that for the age .,sport
there only been a handful of time where a first round pick and a first round second pick pick one and two that are quarterback matched off since the beginning of the super bowl era of one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven .,sport
and thats a pretty interesting feat .,sport
to say the least the nfl definitely know how to market darius ?,sport
they knew what they were doing when they put this on the schedule brother .,sport
yes indeed .,sport
it is going to be very interesting to see how washington start out a far a their defense is concerned how they look to attack u today .,sport
and i think thats going to be the determination on who and where and who the ball go to .,sport
and help u understand a little bit better about what we got out there a far a the defense .,sport
who to look out for darius and brandon .,sport
who over there in washington ?,sport
because a far a i know the guy that i knew that were the household name they are much gone in my mind .,sport
help u out .,sport
i know that kerrigan is gone ?,sport
he not there anymore .,sport
thats with u . this is a revenge game .,sport
let u know who we got for the listener out there please bro .,sport
you got a hall of famer bobby wagner .,sport
let start on the sideline .,sport
super bowl appearance with the coach a far a he went .,sport
he wa with the atlanta falcon .,sport
i lived here in atlanta .,sport
had the defense born very .,sport
he asked me on stud out there but they are young .,sport
but the audience wa late .,sport
darius is that whats going on here ?,sport
is this a class case of where a coach can help elevate player that we might not typically know and they can play at a higher level than what we think they are ?,sport
and they slide in and do damage that we are not ready for ?,sport
is this potentially what could be happening there ?,sport
i wouldnt say that .,sport
but his experience and him being one of the top coordinator at this time of the game doe make a difference .,sport
he doe understand football at a high level .,sport
and he been very successful .,sport
he wa successful with the dallas cowboy with the same aggressive defense scheme .,sport
but we all understand that it come down to the player .,sport
we have the guy in the middle .,sport
he a hall of famer bobby wagner former seattle seahawk .,sport
he one of the perimeter guy that play middle lineback in his league .,sport
he the leader of this squad .,sport
and he surrounded by a bunch of youngster .,sport
he got st. jude and forbes a far a the corner are concerned .,sport
but those guy st. jude always find himself in good situation most of the time .,sport
i am bad with these guy last night or sometime .,sport
let talk about position for now .,sport
the defensive end they can not get to the quarterback especially with dan quinns listen style .,sport
number ninety nine he a young guy very aggressive .,sport
he know how to turn the corner get to the qb .,sport
now we understand that they are missing the top defense of tackle the leader of that front line with the pet .,sport
is it a torn pet ?,sport
i believe it is all i heard wa chest .,sport
but they still have some young guy in that middle thats saying hungry to make a difference. . what do you think ?,sport
whats your take on all that brandon ?,sport
who should we be looking out for on the defensive side ?,sport
i know the offense get a lot of love but is that defense something that we need to look at ?,sport
i wa going to piggyback off of what he said about bobby wagner .,sport
thats the only person i could think of .,sport
i do not follow that team too much and i havent been doing my homework this week honestly .,sport
i can not say too much about that other than bobby wagner .,sport
i think thats fair .,sport
thats a fair statement because a lot of u know how highpowered that offense is over there and it is something that you spend much time on and you do not look at all the other stuff .,sport
how long did darius how long did rodman fly under the radar while on the bull with jordan and all his awesomeness ?,sport
there some player that eventually you are wait hold up a minute .,sport
you are i am not going to be able to shoot your life .,sport
all these thing .,sport
and who that little eyed that keep passing the ball to the mailman ?,sport
it is thing that that pas u by and when you start to look at these team and they are starting to build momentum and you are hold up now .,sport
it can not be thats cooking it .,sport
there got to be something more to it .,sport
i am excited to see this team see what it is because at the end of the day jaden daniel and caleb in a lot of people mind is going to be around for a very long time .,sport
and to that point i want everyone to focus on something .,sport
we could be very a part of greatness something thats going to be around for a decade plus on both side .,sport
it is been a while since weve had some great qbs and a good qb draft .,sport
let enjoy the moment and marinate in it getting back to my food analogy and be happy that we have some great player out there .,sport
do not get caught up in should we ?,sport
should i cut a wood ?,sport
get the fact get it that we got one of the two in the building and let celebrate and not tolerate the fact that we got who we got .,sport
and enjoy all the other part on the team too .,sport
do not be focused on the qb .,sport
a lot of people do that .,sport
there a lot more player who we witnessed the other day when we were blessed to have earl ochre on this set .,sport
and you guy away bobby wagner linebacker do not forget about him .,sport
he on the team .,sport
he a field general .,sport
he having a coach on the field .,sport
is he the same a who he wa ?,sport
none of u are a we age .,sport
but what happens ?,sport
because of repetition we get smarter and we do not have to work harder .,sport
expect bobby to go out there and be that guy that elevates others around him .,sport
because that is a true definition of somebody that is great .,sport
it is not elevating yourself .,sport
it is elevating people around you .,sport
i do want to get into some fantasy football .,sport
if there anything else that you guy would to talk about let chop it up quick .,sport
let quickly i would to hear your guy prediction .,sport
for those out there there might be a couple that do not know that darius and i are pretty much locked in this week on the same dang score .,sport
but i did change it around a little bit the other day for you darius or marriota versus jaden .,sport
i am going to lock back in on that one .,sport
but let start off with brandon .,sport
let hear what his prediction is .,sport
my god it is winning twenty four to fourteen .,sport
twenty fourfourteen ? .,sport
thats thirty eight point ?,sport
that would be the under on today .,sport
i think the spread wa forty three i think or somewhere around there .,sport
you are calling for a close defensive game .,sport
and but well score ten more point .,sport
thats interesting .,sport
and what ?,sport
i think i saw darius if i am not mistaken another one of our guy or listener in the comment section had a very close similar score too .,sport
i am interested to see if that happens .,sport
and i am not surprised if it doe .,sport
what about you ?,sport
it could .,sport
i do not care what the score is .,sport
be honest with you .,sport
i want to win .,sport
is there any weather condition out there darius ?,sport
do we have any wind or is it cold out there now ?,sport
have you guy looked at it ?,sport
but it is in dc .,sport
and this time of the year it is thin temperature are starting to creep down a little bit .,sport
i am sure it may not be eighty degree it is here where i am .,sport
but i told you i told you i am rubbing that in .,sport
mr. top is over there .,sport
but i am sure a long a it is mild hopefully we do not have to worry about any of the element .,sport

what do you think buddy ?,sport
what do you think about today ?,sport
do you think that possibly we could elevate past twenty four ?,sport
what did you say twenty fourfourteen ?,sport
or do you think that it is going to be low scoring ?,sport
and why did you put it that low ?,sport
i have to come back and ask you that because i forgot early .,sport
i feel if i did predict a higher score it would bite me .,sport
i picked something that wa more difficult .,sport
yeah my prediction aint the greatest but i have some fun with it .,sport
hey thats an average game man .,sport
have fun man. . have fun with it .,sport
win baby .,sport
in the mighty word of al davis win baby .,sport
if we all could predict the future man i am pretty sure .,sport
we have a lot of thing going on ?,sport
gary stradamus over there .,sport
listen i want to get into this fantasy man because it is a lot of wait hold on a second .,sport
this in .,sport
we got a weather report from j2k man .,sport
he saying sunny fifty nine degree and a little wind in dc .,sport
you at that point you can still say ice cold beer but if it drop below fifty do not .,sport
say cold beer or say beer .,sport
i remember in chicago man it wa a december game and this guy wa saying get your ice cold beer .,sport
and i am bro your sale are going to be down if you are pushing cold bro .,sport
i filled out five credit card application i could get a bunch of scar and put it all around me man .,sport

warm up your hand .,sport
i am bro ill take two of those .,sport
sunny and fifty nine .,sport
i think thats good .,sport
you can get a good lather going some sweat going but i do not think you are going to get super cold .,sport
my bos say there heat in the tool .,sport
these guy are going to be running hard to stay warm .,sport
we got to remember that this is an evening game .,sport
it is not a one oclock game .,sport
those guy by the time five thirty sixty oclock those temperature are going to creep down a little bit more .,sport
yeah because itll be three oclock here four oclock there .,sport
and by the time darius said by the time that sunset it is going to be getting dark .,sport
and yeah it is going to start dropping man with a little bit of wind he said .,sport
that wind is more influential when it drop down .,sport
itll get a little bit nippy but we got to get used to it man .,sport
thats bare weather baby .,sport
the scroll say thirty seven seventeen .,sport
thats interesting .,sport
thats close to what darius score is and close to mine .,sport
we are around hovering around thirty one thirty seven to seventeen around that neck of the wood .,sport
bido want to go to the daniel playing .,sport
and bido yes jaden daniel all report are that jaden will play .,sport
nothing ha been confirmed but it look he a go .,sport
and one of the lead team staff member on the team said he a tough son of a gun .,sport
thats good to hear .,sport
let look forward to seeing that young man play .,sport
yeah let see what keiths got to say .,sport
sound he playing .,sport
washington know the defense is going to light up either way .,sport
scroll calebs pass cut through wind butter .,sport
keith jaylen johnson played daniel in college .,sport
shut him down .,sport
a lot of guy are struggling with some pick most notably one of our guy last night a guy that brandon know had a good question .,sport
he had a question about the quarterback for seattle versus jaden daniel .,sport
and i always look at those matchup ?,sport
i look at defense the defense that they have to go against their health .,sport
all that ha a little bit to do with my decision .,sport
and usually my older brother say when i talk after i am done he say brandon start your bench and sit your starter because thats usually how it work after the game .,sport
thats how i look at it .,sport
let get off the top .,sport
this is a guy that sean sean stradamus he good at making prediction and looking and scouting and whatnot .,sport
he with four star .,sport
we have him on wednesday night .,sport
baltimore raven at cleveland brown .,sport
david najoku for this season .,sport
he ha one hundred and sixty five yard .,sport
he average forty one.three per game .,sport
he got one touchdown and twenty nine target .,sport
now najoku saw a league high of fourteen target last week with amari cooper being gone .,sport
that is very important to look at .,sport
we were talking about injury and how they influence your decisionmaking on who to start and whatever .,sport
and well let darius tee off on this in a second .,sport
but he get a big upgrade at qb with james winston starting .,sport
and i am looking forward to looking into the fact of james winston starting .,sport
i think he still got some left in the tank man .,sport
i the guy .,sport
najoku ha earned thirty one first read target rate over the last two week .,sport
thats pretty high .,sport
and he get an extreme passfinal defense against the raven that have allowed nfl low fifty one.seven running back rushing yard per game but the most passing yard this season .,sport
baltimore opponent have the league third highest pas rate at sixty six .,sport
winston threw a touchdown during his only drive last week .,sport
najoku is a top three tight end now .,sport
they are saying by all report start najoku .,sport
what do you say about this brandon and darius ?,sport
they do not have a whole lot of weapon over there .,sport
they are going to be playing some third string wherever seed wa over there a . the quarterback change is the big thing because desonant watson ha not been able to move this offense .,sport
everyone at cleveland would have hoped .,sport
nick chubb is back .,sport
thats going to help james out .,sport
or whoever the star qb is going to be this week tremendously .,sport
for the people who drafted chubb this is the time to play him .,sport
he scored last week .,sport
thats all any time your guy that you draft get his own a always a plus .,sport
against baltimore he had decent success against them .,sport
but with the quarterback thats playing this week i think he going to change thing .,sport
most tight end are for quarterback thats not very it is not in the upper echelon .,sport
hey derrick quickly back to that running back .,sport
i have him and i wa going to elevate him .,sport
but i talked to jim miller about who i wanted to start .,sport
because i have chubbs or i have jsn a my flex .,sport
and he said go with jsn because chubbs is now coming out .,sport
and it could go either way .,sport
but the safe bet is to go jsn who going against buffalo .,sport
i wa a little questioning that decision by jim miller .,sport
i wanted to start chubbs .,sport
honestly if he wa coming off an injury and only had one week behind i think he would have had a different decision behind that .,sport
but whats your thought on that man ?,sport
starting jsn over chubbs man .,sport
i am going to be honest with you .,sport
seattle going to throw the ball .,sport
thats going down the field .,sport
in this particular setting i would take jsn over chubb .,sport
because buffalo defense ha been coming along the last couple of week .,sport
but when you have a guy gino and the offense they are playing in .,sport
because i do not think i know dk metcalf got hurt a did not he last week ?,sport
thats a good listen .,sport
that could thats definitely going to boost up on that .,sport
there he might have touched on that .,sport
very smart very smart counter .,sport
i now thing are starting to line up .,sport
that is a huge part .,sport
hard to leave out .,sport
i am sorry about that .,sport
it sure is .,sport
that make that make the world of a difference .,sport
last i looked wa leading the league and passing yard too .,sport
we already know whats going on .,sport
he going to throw the football a lot .,sport
he going to need some guy that he going to need to i am saying he going to need to lean on the guy that he familiar with .,sport
jsm north and a look out for that one .,sport
that tight end .,sport
brandon i want to tap in quick .,sport
whats your thought on this starting the .,sport
no joe koo is that you think thats a smart move especially with the rocky position there in with switching quarterback and amari cooper and all that ?,sport
i do not follow the fantasy .,sport
i couldnt answer that question to help you out honestly .,sport
you got to edit all these .,sport
i do not weve got to try to go around that when we are alive because thats thats we are never mind .,sport
but at least you are honest .,sport
yeah but he he a good target outside outside .,sport
what we would do is we would think outside of fantasy and think about the logistics of who is going to get the ball .,sport
if this guy is not here obviously there going to be more target .,sport
and then i said earlier he got a lot of target last week .,sport
if they fall suit with that the logical the logical guess it is not a confirmed we do not know what their play is but they potentially would use this guy more because cooper out if that make sense brandon .,sport
anyways moving forward .,sport
also something to look at .,sport
rashad bateman look to become a flex option of zay flower sits .,sport
zay flower is potentially out there .,sport
i have him on one of my family team .,sport
this is what i want to do the show with you guy because weve got another twenty nine minute before you make your final selection .,sport
youve got to make your selection at one thousand one hundred and thirty .,sport
this portion ha been brought to you by underdog fantasy .,sport
enter the promo code csp that chicago sport podcast csp .,sport
the first thousand they match the next thousand .,sport
they gave you a fifty percent back .,sport
darius and i we hop on it all the time .,sport
we all get on there and we do pretty good man .,sport
the minimum that you can place a bet with is ten .,sport
you do not have to throw a lot of money on to win a lot of money .,sport
it is a good time .,sport
it make it more enjoyable to look at thing outside of the chicago bear .,sport
once the chicago bear is done what i am saying ?,sport
yeah thats a flower is a big he been a little blub of a let down this year .,sport
darius he there a change .,sport
schematically once you add a guy a big running back back there yeah it is can you hear you at him back there ?,sport
it is going to change .,sport
you are going to have to offer your offense you are going to lean more and toward that direction but he had a heck of a game .,sport
he had a heck of a game against the commander .,sport
he did not quite get in the end zone but he wa very productive .,sport
when you have an offense thats predicated to the run that you have to take what you get a far a past catcher and thing that .,sport
you those are the thing that you have to be aware of when you are crafting player and also the player that you are choosing to play on a weekly basis .,sport
to go along with what you said darius keith said he stretched thin this week .,sport
he gotten a calf on ir .,sport
there a lot of stuff going on .,sport
they are playing musical chair now on the freaking titanic on a lot of team where they are shipping out and shipping in wide receiver .,sport
thats a premium position because the quarterback are the highest price tag in the league and it is a passing league and you got to have wide receiver to catch them ball .,sport
they are going to be the second highest price tag .,sport
and a lot of people are realizing that they need one more target or they got a guy down this guy doe the referee at running back and you got to have receiver in order to take that take all that into consideration .,sport
keith said problem is what wide receiver do they got ?,sport
they are going to crowd the box on chub .,sport
thats where we were talking earlier about going to that tight end because you got to have somebody he also said higgins echler but i am not playing echler versus barris d. now they do have jerry they have jerry judy .,sport
they have jerry judy .,sport
he not listening .,sport
he not a hollow .,sport
he not one of these super great name .,sport
he had a great name coming out of alabama out of alabama but he production hasnt matched the height that he had .,sport
also a quiet guy he not very he do not jump off the screen a lot of time either .,sport
but playing with james winston or any of the backfubs he have a great rapport with him .,sport
he good for a lot of stuff underneath .,sport
now this is the nfl and all of these guy are great at something. ?,sport
going to this game these defense you have to respect if you do not respect these guy theyll burn you .,sport
i am sure they may start off in the eight man box or whatever but if you get beat down that scene but no if youll change that .,sport
john brought a good point up to u . darius terry mcclaren .,sport
and he ha on fantasy league and he ha zero game this season under fifty yard .,sport
he move around a lot and cliff will put him in favorable matchup avoiding jalen .,sport
john i you are i hope you make it to all of our fantasy man .,sport
thanks for being there man .,sport
we need you in the chat man .,sport
and he absolutely .,sport
he absolutely .,sport
they are going to move mcclaren around because you have to try to avoid him getting under the shadow of jalen johnson .,sport
and the way that cliff cliff kingsbury offensive ran is a lot of east to west a lot of drag route .,sport
now if we if the quarterback break contain and get loose out there that could be an issue a because that make you susceptible to deep ball ?,sport
he absolutely .,sport
now john ha a very important question and they are all trying to make their pick .,sport
well try to get through these a quickly a possible .,sport
i do want to ask brandon a quick question about montgomery because thats the next player well target .,sport
and we have a lot of information of montgomery since he wa a prior bear and iowa football player iowa state .,sport
he say i am five and two in fantasy league facing another five and two .,sport
john i am the reciprocal of that .,sport
i am very jealous of your five and two .,sport
battle for first place .,sport
thats awesome .,sport
he starting per perty over jd five this week .,sport
whats that ?,sport
thats a jaden dane .,sport
maybe the five is a it is number. . or rb should he start a hubbard or stevenson ?,sport
he thinking stevenson. . now this is what i do not know .,sport
who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who the patriot playing against this week. . keith who are the patriot up against this week ?,sport
or wa no that wa john question .,sport
knowledge knowledge on team .,sport
hey thanks for coming back brother .,sport
travis homer is our fullback outside the red zone .,sport
our goal package i would guess thats interesting because i almost gave up against travis .,sport
and now that i know that he our fullback and we released our fullback in the blaston game which i thought wa a decent guy .,sport
that thats interesting to know .,sport
thanks for giving u that knowledge knowledge .,sport
keith said he definitely told me something. ?,sport
it is possible .,sport
i did see him punch one in a few week back and i wa wondering he in on our team .,sport
he said the jet is who they are up against .,sport
now remember remandre stevenson lost .,sport
he lost he lost a bunch of carry because he ha a family issue .,sport
take that into consideration .,sport
and he wa injured but he had more he had probably ball security within the last couple of week a . and remandre he said remandre stevenson versus who ?,sport
hold on hold on hold on .,sport
i think it wa the running back for hubbard hubbard .,sport
chubba hubbard that carolina situation .,sport
and they are back they are back to the young fella .,sport
they drafted too. . pretend crew checking in .,sport
whats up dan ?,sport
i got my hat on backwards this day .,sport
i am going to turn it around because it is a crucial catch that anyways at a respect for you and your crew dan which i wa a part of .,sport
somebody said all noon game sucked this week .,sport
thats a possibility since the bear are playing at three .,sport
ill have to say yes far .,sport
getting back to david montgomery brandon .,sport
interesting tail .,sport
i never wanted to go .,sport
he got my favorite number five on his jersey .,sport
he got three hundred and eighty two yard this year average and sixty three.seven .,sport
thats pretty good when you are considering a timeshare and you are looking at somebody in the red zone to punch it in and he scored on average up until last week .,sport
one touchdown a game .,sport
maybe they gave that guy a little break since he wa banged up the week before but he averaging an over four point yard which is huge .,sport
thats a lot .,sport
yard per catch is six and twenty one .,sport
no no six touchdown .,sport
six touchdown .,sport
i wa twenty one touchdown twenty six touchdown .,sport
and a long a a twenty one yard .,sport
i i he he been at practice this whole week brandon .,sport
and that guy a workhorse .,sport
i think even if he a little banged up brian say a real player play ?,sport
the titan are not an easy run defense though but the lion ran for one hundred and forty four yard against a tough viking d last week .,sport
thats encouraging for them ?,sport
not encouraging for u . james jameson williams is out and the lion have the league highest implied team total of twenty eight and a half point man .,sport
this week detroit is also the biggest favor with eleven and a half on the board .,sport
i think it is a favorable especially starting against starting mason rudolph and likely missing both of it top wide out .,sport
i think that you would start montgomery .,sport
wouldnt you agree ?,sport
even if you he not your goto cowbell he still look to have a lot of yard .,sport
wouldnt she say brandon ?,sport
i would think .,sport
he a workhorse man .,sport
and go i know he turned he turned his ankle last week .,sport
but i think he good to go .,sport
we all know david montgomery is a soldier man .,sport
he gon na get out there no matter what unless unless the limb missing or something that he ready to play .,sport
now here an interesting factoid guy .,sport
moving forward the lion defense is a top three to start this week .,sport
keep your hand to your hat in case you got him out there .,sport
if he in or thats in the free agency or you got a deion by moving forward .,sport
cj stroud man unbelievable character good talent dual threat qb .,sport
far he got onesix hundred and sixty three yard this year .,sport
he averaging twenty three and a half yard sixty six completion .,sport
he got ten touchdown and a qb rating of ninety four.nine man .,sport
and for john i am sorry to interrupt you try for john .,sport
i would go with hover this week. . go with hubbard .,sport
thats a huge huge loss but he in a good spot to bounce back from one of the worst game of his career last week .,sport
stroud ha gotten eight.seven yard per average and three hundred and eleven passing yard with twenty two total touchdown over eleven game during his career at home .,sport
he also owns a six td to zero interception ratio over three game versus colt and those matchup darry said earlier matter .,sport
theyve also have allowed the fifth most schedule adjusted fantasy point to get back to season .,sport
if you got him out there start stroud make it make it happen .,sport
put them on put them on the board .,sport
i do not think we need to say anything more about that .,sport
it pretty much speaks for itself .,sport
remember game there we got twenty le than twenty minute to get through all these guys. . i am trying to skip through some of them but get to the one that we might need to go back and forth about .,sport
please forgive u guy .,sport
this is our second fantasy before pick on sunday .,sport
green bay packer against the jacksonville deck .,sport
jaguar is very important game for u . i am hoping jacksonville can sneak one in because i want the guy from up north to lose .,sport
i am not saying that it is going to happen .,sport
i am wish thinking they are saying to start romeo dowel .,sport
and i am thinking that this is very interesting because i wa thinking about that other receiver thats been hot lately but they are saying start romeo dowel he got three hundred and twelve yard this year .,sport
and fifty two yard average thirty four target twenty three reception and two touchdown .,sport
what do you say about that darius ?,sport
diles ha been coming on the last couple of week but i know you are talking about reed jen reed .,sport
he been he been there guy all year but going up against jacksonville you can not go wrong man .,sport
they give up a lot of big play .,sport
i they allow the most for outside receiver .,sport
you are you are a hundred percent agree about that .,sport
and even if one cook it is possible both could cook .,sport
that go to piggybacking into that .,sport
i would say also start jordan love too .,sport
i remember sean wa saying start i think it wa at least two hundred and fifty .,sport
if not two hundred and sixty i could be mistaken .,sport
i have a screenshot of who sean think to start on underdog fantasy .,sport
maybe you could pull that up .,sport
darius i am not sure but i know that that wa in our group chat .,sport
but that that seems logical .,sport
if anything we can hope for a dog fight with high point and potentially i do not know the jaguar ride hot and win .,sport
thats it is what do you think brandon ?,sport
you think there even a shot at this or no ?,sport
jaguar the one in. . cool man .,sport
that wa nice and easy man .,sport
thats going to be a fun thats going to be a little funky game .,sport
because the jacksonville can move the football .,sport
they they vary inconsistent in office .,sport
he very sent me a screenshot of who he got on his bench .,sport
it is his he you want to know what his team name is this .,sport
now this is not me speaking .,sport
i am reading. . this is keith .,sport
can i tell him what your team name is ?,sport
ill put a pin in this .,sport
jaden jaden waddle is the next guy we are going to talk about boy .,sport
arizona cardinal at miami dolphin the desert the desert cardinal go down there into my into miami .,sport
now whats that ?,sport
it is going to be a shootout man .,sport
it is going to be a shootout .,sport
. . two hundred and sixty nine yard .,sport
jaden waddle forty four.eight average thirty target twenty two reception zero touchdown .,sport
what do you guy got to say about this here with jaden ?,sport
start them .,sport
two is back .,sport
i can go ahead and do it .,sport
two is back .,sport
you think he going to be rested and ready to go ?,sport
or do you think he going to have a little a little gunshot because gunshot because of the third concussed arizona is a great game .,sport
if youve been struggling at the qb position or not getting back .,sport
arizona is a great game to warm up .,sport
get your foot back in the water with .,sport
knowledge wanted to know who baltimore play .,sport
i felt we touched on that earlier .,sport
good mind over there .,sport
but yeah what do you call it ?,sport
miami ha averaged fewer point per game than the last two winless team in the bryce young led panther but well get a huge boost with to his return .,sport
a you said waddle average forty seven and a half receiving yard zero touchdown over twelve game without to to a but he average seventy five.two receiving yard with all nineteen of his touchdown over forty one game with them .,sport
he eats darius say he going to eat with to u . look for them to connect look to be somebody that he very comfortable with and if you have him it sound it is a must start .,sport
mike mcdaniel call again by different tool and a lot of them .,sport
he said i can go ahead and say what his team name is .,sport
it is called sikwan d nut .,sport
we see something this is fun. . it is fun boy .,sport
he show it show me a team dude .,sport
i i need him to draft for me next year because i do not know what i wa doing .,sport
most people think that when i draft it is an auto draft ?,sport
but he got cj stroud barkley mason hopkins .,sport
he starting hopkins .,sport
he a chief .,sport
whats that brother ?,sport
he a chief now .,sport
yeah. . i the playbook familiarity but you got the goat passing to you .,sport
that help ?,sport
yeah thats his last night .,sport
shakir he a sneaking one man. . cause there d and freaking aubrey from dallas .,sport
dude this guy a freaking legend .,sport
keith you need to be on our fantasy every week man between you and darius brandon and i can coast on autopilot dude cruise control .,sport
this guy got it going on bro .,sport
yeah shakir ha a lot of he josh allen in him he the longest he the longest longest tender receiver over there. ?,sport
mm . . since since since fourteen is left allen ha a good rapport with shakir very sneaky pick man .,sport
now now look at he showing me .,sport
somebody else is showing me their team .,sport
it is show one show off .,sport
let get into that after we go over the pick .,sport
deanna want to show me his now .,sport
anyways let get into this .,sport
this is interesting .,sport
let break it down .,sport
weve already heard from mr. darius lock the lock heart .,sport
exactly what to do here but let break this down .,sport
let see what they say about this .,sport
three hundred and seventy four yard ?,sport
sixty two.three yard average which is pretty pretty good .,sport
not high but decent ?,sport
four point yard per catch .,sport
not i am not excited about that .,sport
and you got three touchdown with a thirty three yard long .,sport
it is a running back .,sport
you are you you cut loose on some of those .,sport
thats what i am thinking .,sport
game plan you are playing with the rookie quarterback man .,sport
that make a difference .,sport
yeah you got to do your check down and you a receiver .,sport
a far a a running back you aint going to go deep but what you do is you look for the yak the yard after catch ?,sport
and it do not feel the gym with that defense that defense feel no rookie going to come in there and throw the ball all over .,sport
it is been let down of that .,sport
ive got them on my fantasy and they are .,sport
theyve had some tough matchup man going against them .,sport
pretty good qbs last couple of week though .,sport
darius i hope you are brother .,sport
the game script limited stevenson touchdown last week .,sport
he should be healthier after returning to full practice this thursday .,sport
a few day ago stevenson hasnt even fumbled in back to back game .,sport
thats huge .,sport
jet opponent have averaged the eighth most rushing attempt in the league .,sport
stevenson ha gotten five.two yard per carry and average eighty five rushing yard and one touchdown over two game and drake may give the offense life .,sport
the jet have allowed the 12th most scheduled adjusted fantasy point to running back .,sport
we were talking about tough team and all that but there some tough running back when excluding receiving .,sport
stevenson can be started if needed .,sport
the patriot are a touchdown underdog and have a low league total but running back is thin this week .,sport
i see i see the other side about starting stevenson .,sport
i also see where you could start hubbard also ?,sport
yeah i do not think it is a wrong answer but i looked at the matchup and a rookie court where a rookie quarterback going into facing new york .,sport
it seems they are going to stack the box up on them .,sport
cause the paper is not filled with weapon either .,sport
keith said that both jet safety are out .,sport
thats huge .,sport
three hundred and fifteen yard three touchdown one pick .,sport
let move on to darius neck of the wood at lanagh tampa bay .,sport
they are saying to start rashad .,sport
i think it is rashad with two a white .,sport
two hundred and twenty seven yard three hundred and thirty seven.eight yard average yard per catch is three.seven .,sport
no touchdown and fifty six long .,sport
bucky bucky irving is dealing with a foot injury that could promise .,sport
this is better .,sport
thats a sweet while chris godwin and mike evans are out .,sport
white and sean tucker will see an expanded role in a matchup that should be fast paced tampa game have averaged a whopping fifty five.six point this season .,sport
and white should see even more target than usual .,sport
he the next option this week .,sport
man ill tell you what i wish i had rashad this week .,sport
it sound he going to be the bell cow man .,sport
yeah he definitely is .,sport
but take also take a look at why receiver mcmillan .,sport
and i think thats it is that sterling shepherd .,sport
also the tight end number eighty eight autonomous .,sport
i can not i am bad with these guy name .,sport
a top autotoman .,sport
look at him a . yeah .,sport
ive been seeing his name and going back to what wa the name you said a little bit ago mcmillan you were talking about mcmillan a little while ago man and what ?,sport
i should listen to you because he wa available and i did not go .,sport
maybe i think i did and i did not pick him up which doesnt make sense because if i am in last place i should be first in the way .,sport
wait whats going on man ?,sport
my math aint math garius .,sport
yeah mcmillan he he had chance to slow but he ha a problem with drop but this week i do not think they have much of a choice .,sport
if he open they have to go to him because they are there .,sport
they are two stud are out man .,sport
that this is a term .,sport
this is the time when the term next man up is very critical .,sport
and this next segment is brought to you by tc world of wonder your headquarters for all your dream chicago sport jersey and memorabilia .,sport

let move on to the philadelphia eagle at cincinnati bengal .,sport
what do you feel about this brand ?,sport
and what do you feel about the eagle and the bengal ?,sport
now to me it look a shit show because the eagle are pretty much a shell of themselves and the bengal they won one game that not still making me a believer .,sport
i am i am worried they are saying start t higgins but i heard t higgins is out in the chat .,sport
we are not we are going to move on past this one but i would to hear your take on this game .,sport
man you said man both these team it is hard .,sport
who going to come out with that win ?,sport
they are both struggling now .,sport
but t higgins is out though .,sport
why wouldnt i start him ?,sport
yeah exactly .,sport
what yeah youd have to look at somebody else in that situation with with he being out and i do not know who the next man up is .,sport
camp in nasa name number eighty .,sport
start last night start with a i he going to be he a big he a bigger style receiver similar to higgins but i do not think he ha higgins a opposed to this .,sport
no boy in boy in tennessee .,sport
and no it is number eighty .,sport
last night start with a i i can not pronounce it .,sport
man these guy in the chat they will bail u out early and often man especially a far a i did not know he wa out .,sport
i know yesterday i seen that he wa questionable but if he out they have office office for since then that is not an issue .,sport
they have joe burrow have they have little office line issue but he still delivering the football defense .,sport
i think we can score against that defense even though they have two good pas rusher everything else is a lot .,sport
they leave a lot what i am saying ?,sport
to be desired out there on defense .,sport
everyone they played against ran ran up the number on them pretty much .,sport
knowledge say a white dude rookie .,sport
it is coming .,sport
it is coming .,sport
hey darius brandon i think next show we need to start at ten oclock .,sport
thats my bet .,sport
i thought that we could get through intent from ten thirty to eleven thirty .,sport
i thought we could get through all this because with the bear we can easily get through the bear but thats one team that we are talking about .,sport
you got to get through the whole nfl and all these guy .,sport
you guy start a little earlier especially if we want to get these guy a little bit of help before the eleven thirty shotgun what i am saying ?,sport
thats my bad .,sport
we are learning a we go guy but i appreciate all your help .,sport

i am excited about that .,sport
but yeah let get back into fantasy .,sport
i wanted to give that shameless plug to our to our crew and our team .,sport
man quickly j k dobbin man i am disappointed .,sport
i feel bad for this guy .,sport
the injury and stuff especially baltimore a a team man .,sport
i remember we were three or four deep and i am there no way .,sport
and they seem to always find a guy the niner .,sport
they always seem to find a running back or maybe it is our offensive line and their coaching .,sport
i do not know but j k dobbin is now in los angeles .,sport
and i wa looking for him to show up and show out .,sport
i do not know whats going to happen man .,sport
now he only averaging three point yard per carry since getting over a nine point nine over the first two game of the season .,sport
and the charger are touchdown home favorite against a reeling saint team starting spencer rattler which is a bad move man .,sport
game script should be favorable .,sport
what do you guy say about this man ?,sport
he on my team .,sport
he on my team and i am starting them .,sport
he got he had an injury in between those in between week three and week four if i am not mistaken .,sport
and sandy los angeles is dealing with a challenge of philosophy .,sport
there it is .,sport
thanks keith .,sport
but again but this week i think my man from georgia he wa banged up too .,sport
makaaki ha emerged to be the number one receiver .,sport
and then also the tight end for la disney if i am saying it correctly disney he should receive a whole lot of rep a a makaaki shell open up and shell open up thing for j.k. dobbin to do a thing .,sport
hardball belief in running the football .,sport
i he love to run in the football .,sport
weve seen that over in michigan weve seen that time and time again .,sport
he love running the football and setting up that quarterback .,sport
very smart call .,sport
i agree with that .,sport
thanks again there for that we saw go up man .,sport
got over a hundred in chat .,sport
brandon what do you say about this man ?,sport
it seems a no brainer to start j.k. dobbin bro ?,sport
thats what it sound to me .,sport
id start them .,sport
keith say mckonkey is money in the slot .,sport
there you go bro .,sport
hit that slot machine money maker .,sport
let move on quick to buffalo bill at seattle seahawks .,sport
cooper wa on the field for thirty four of josh allen dropbacks during his first game in buffalo but he had a forty two tprr and led the team in fantasy point .,sport
seattle top corner rick woolen and trey brown are banged up and or out in cooper role is sure to grow in sunday fast paced matchup .,sport
cooper can be a top twenty wide receiver moving forward after the huge upgrade at quarterback .,sport
what do you guy got to say about this ?,sport
yeah look for a mark cooper to see a lot of the field today .,sport
last week wa his first week in buffalo they gradually brought him in but he did score a touchdown for those owner of him .,sport
that wa a good thing .,sport
i expect to see a lot more production out here today a he give more familiar with the offense and josh allen is going to be josh allen .,sport
they have also learned to run the football a lot more .,sport
we should open amari up on the play action a . no yeah i agree with you .,sport
and it make sense to do that .,sport
ive always been a fan of his and and i wish him the best .,sport
and i think he in a good place now .,sport
once i saw that he he moved in a buffalo .,sport
i said good thats that he he would do good with at least i think he would do good with allen .,sport
i do not know all the detail but thinking forward thinking here an interesting thing .,sport
our next is brought to you by river street cavern .,sport
most delish chicago most delicious and fun sport diving dining experience had to river street cavern and they got chicago biggest game man check them out .,sport
and they are saying that we need to sit .,sport
geno smith will be missing dk metcalf and get a run funnel buffalo defense outdoors .,sport
this is interesting .,sport
let let hear what they have to say about this .,sport
i am not in a grudge at all with this .,sport
i do not this is i am not backing this this thought. . allen scored two touchdown during his last game but he the wide receiver and nx 49th wide receiver ranked in expected fantasy point .,sport
allen could return from the buy healthier after playing through a heel injury but it is possible .,sport
rom dunze see a rookie postpied bump a . i am thinking that i do not know why they would want to sit geno smith because he unless you have unless you have someone a more high caliber quarterback .,sport
i do not i wouldnt understand why you would do that .,sport
but hey man your team i do not think thats why though .,sport
you have to look at both side and thats what we try to do .,sport
i do not i can not agree with that side at all .,sport
and it doesnt sound curious to u either but he said it is your team .,sport
i skipped ahead to that bear washington game .,sport
they are saying sit keenan allen .,sport
i am also not agreeing with this one .,sport
i think he going to show out but let see what whats what we got in the note .,sport
allen scored the two touchdown .,sport
he could do better with his coming back from the heel injury .,sport
i understand why they sent that stick keenan but i do not agree with it. . exactly .,sport
caleb williams is unquestionably shown growth and we could continue to improve but his last three game against three easiest matchup in the league he gotten six yard per average and taken eleven sack with the two.four touchdown to interception ratio on the road to open up his career .,sport
this matchup wa moved to prime time but the total sits forty three point .,sport
thanks to marcus mario to likely starting for jaden daniel .,sport
look for those point to grow .,sport
i would bet the over if it is still at forty three because of that because of that .,sport
i think it wa set thinking that this tough kid is not going to play .,sport
if he play i think look to see more point out on the field washington defense is also dramatically improved allowing the seventh few year epa play over the last three game .,sport
the commander have also yielded the fourth fewest fantasy point to the slot over the last month .,sport
allen deserves bench consideration because of being at the slot .,sport
but we also know that kenan allen is a swiss army knife man .,sport
you could put him at x y and z. it do not matter .,sport
he going to eat .,sport
here the thing .,sport
washington play a heavy man concept on defense .,sport
they are heavy man and they feel they feel that kenan is a lot more productive in the zone because he find hole in the zone sits there and the ball is saying find him .,sport
thats why i think people are are heavy on sitting them which is understandable .,sport
but if anybody but it all depends on how your team is set up at the end of the day .,sport
if you can afford it if you can afford to sit somebody kenan allen then but what i am saying ?,sport
i wouldnt sit them for anybody .,sport
obviously you guy know that i need them on my team the way i spoke about my team .,sport
i am not going to tell you to set freaking kenan. . jesus piece .,sport
keith is saying yeah but who is washington played the bear have played ?,sport
good point .,sport
they played boston .,sport
they played baltimore .,sport
they played they played tampa and they played the giant but the giant defense is not terrible .,sport
i did not realize that .,sport
i thought they were still stalwart or maybe is it their run defense ?,sport
that raven is i told guy before raven have the truck or have trouble with speed .,sport
they have speed when they have speed .,sport
they are going to get speed in their secondary to have trouble with it .,sport
and this kingsbury offense you got a lot of little speedy guy around there .,sport
we can not say that because it did not matter if they played tampa in week ten a long a they had number thirteen over there a long a tampa ha number thirteen there .,sport
and they had his number two there they were going to get that against washington regardless .,sport
he say tampa tampa week one week one is a toss .,sport
i am not sure if he meant toss or loss but no he feel everything everybodys even week one .,sport
and thats not thats not true. . here here something else we got to get into now .,sport
that is one of the guy that i traded away him and t higgins .,sport
i traded away for the running back for gibbs .,sport
that wa my trade t higgins and javante for gibbs .,sport
and i thought that wa a smart move because he the cowbell ?,sport
he get a lot of run and he get a lot of reception and he did a great job last year but they are not passing to him a much .,sport
and it look a whole different game plan .,sport
when when montgomery wa banged up i he obviously cooked ?,sport
but now that assuming that montgomery is healthier maybe he take some of that away but getting back into javante he averaging five point yard per carry and sixteen.eight point over opportunity the last four game .,sport
he get a prime matchup against the panther defense allowing by far most fantasy point to run back this season .,sport
bronco are double digit home favorite against a bryce young led carolina team thats seated in the nfl high thirteen rushing score .,sport
denver ha highest implied total twenty six.five point .,sport
williams is a top fifteen running back this week .,sport
thats had williams this week .,sport
williams williams is coming along too .,sport
i think he suffered an injury earlier earlier in the season .,sport
and then i think to get to get the quarterback acclimated to the nfl sean payton sean payton leading on a heavy pas .,sport
offense for him .,sport
the first couple of week he wa throwing a ball that he wa throwing .,sport
he had many past attempt .,sport
he ha come along and again what better way what better game and what better team to see if you are struggling ?,sport
or if you want to what i am saying boost your number .,sport
then it seemed carolina .,sport
and now we are going to talk about sitting chub hubbard who been terrific but is terrible situation .,sport
carolina will be starting young on an offense missing deontay johnson and adam theland against the denver defense allowing an nfl low four.four yard per play .,sport
the panther have an anemic sixteen.five point implied team total and hubbard ha averaged one hundred and thirty one yard from scrimmage and nineteen.four fantasy point in three full game without young in the season he averaged fifty nine.three and nine.nine fantasy point during four game with him .,sport
i would say sit start chub because there not a whole lot of weapon .,sport
i understand the matchup you talked about earlier going against that stout defense where he may not be able to eat brother .,sport
chubb is a chubb is a stud man .,sport
and i said unless you have in the fantasy world chubb is considered a stud and then he said unless you have someone thats equivalent to him ?,sport
but i am going to sit nick chubb for anybody .,sport
whats that ?,sport
i wouldnt sit nick chubb for chubba hubbard .,sport
no no no they werent saying sit nick chubb for chubb they were talking about chubb the whole time. . yeah .,sport
cause they are going against denver and the the stout defense and thelans out and freaking up .,sport
and dehante johnson out who dropped the ball a lot when i dripped .,sport
i traded for him last year because i always do this .,sport
i always get a guy jamar chase and tim and higgins .,sport
and then last year i got dehante and pickens .,sport
i am i got two receiver on same team and you got by week and someone going to eat and sometimes somebody not .,sport
it is it is ridiculous .,sport
i do not know why i do it .,sport
i two good receiver .,sport
if you need somebody to lean on if you desperate carolina ha a rookie out of south carolina number seventeen might have to pick him up or you lean on the sander tight end sander from all of texas. . number zero .,sport
thats if you are in i am saying no man land and you need somebody put there. . yeah .,sport
you got to have a some backup and they are a lot .,sport
some of some of u are in that situation bro because there a lot of there a lot of injury this year man .,sport
already guy are getting banged up and stuff .,sport
and i thought that this whole thing about minus in a preseason game wa going to keep guy healthy .,sport
i do not think football is football regardless .,sport
the next game say kansa city chief at the raider start patch mahomes .,sport
now mahomes ha been a shell of himself .,sport
had receiver or anything that .,sport
he got more interception than he doe touchdown .,sport
and quite honestly when you are looking at all this it show how legit .,sport
their coach andy reed is man .,sport
this guy can get it done even when it is back up against the wall and they are plagued with injury .,sport
i think if we had this many injury with chicago bear wed be losing our freaking mind any team would .,sport
you got the goat over there darius .,sport
mahomes is likely to start performing up to his early adp expectation moving forward but he a solid start this week .,sport
he due for touchdown regression while ranking sixth in red zone pass but twenty two touchdown especially with the addition of deandre .,sport
now deandre can cook in the end zone .,sport
he is a red red zone target .,sport
and i look for him to get some jump ball and get some touchdown up .,sport
i am happy for mahomes that he finally ha somebody that can help him get that going because xavier worthy a a rookie good player but he not no de hop man .,sport
dehop is going to make that team look entirely different man .,sport
and he going to make worthy look better too .,sport
cause he worthy worthy between travis kelsie and hopkins .,sport
defense have to respect those name because of their resume .,sport
that mean worthy could be wide open a whole lot .,sport
hey darius let take a trip down met narrative street now memory lane .,sport
the raider beat mahomes in kansa city on christmas day ?,sport
the last time his team met and they mocked him with the kermit the frog puppet in training camp .,sport
remember that ?,sport
mahomes responded it and he say it will get handled .,sport
he going to take care of business .,sport
it will get handled .,sport
and his personal trainer tweeted we will remember .,sport
he i think mahomes is out for blood in a revenge on sunday bro .,sport
hey hey it aint going to be an easy killing .,sport
and it will not be an easy killing .,sport
a while than this than raider today .,sport
he going to wow .,sport
it will not be easy .,sport
you are killing the wild in the raider today .,sport
on on your what do you call it ?,sport
all of your great clip man .,sport
thats the one thats going to be the one that stand out. . thered be your mount rushmore clip there .,sport
thats a good one .,sport
for sure man .,sport
we are clipping that one .,sport
here here something interesting .,sport
i want you guy to look at alexander and madison .,sport
man that guy looked good .,sport
he look good in minnesota. . he look different though .,sport
he he look a lot more explosive .,sport
and when what what he called helped me out the running back that is absolutely i do not see him anywhere .,sport
the one thats playing now .,sport
is he playing somewhere ?,sport
no they play thursday .,sport
no no no no i am talking about he wa there for for a few year .,sport
he wa there starting running back for a few year .,sport
for quite a few year man .,sport
i am trying to .,sport
dalvin cook he with the cowboy .,sport
he play today .,sport
dalvin got banged up a lot .,sport
every time dalvin got banged up madison came in and he went off .,sport
i am wow i wa looking forward to alexander .,sport
i thought that he potentially would stay with but they shipped both of them out .,sport
but they are saying to sit alexander madison who will be dealing with a negative game script against the chief defense allowing the fewest fantasy point we are talking about fantasy point guy to running back with a wide margin .,sport
no one ha reached even sixty yard rushing yard against kansa city chief this season .,sport
thats interesting to note because i did not know that .,sport
did that ?,sport
there is .,sport
i had an idea but i watched them against the falcon .,sport
the falcon had a lot of success with them doing a run but they had a twoheaded monster with with thunder and lightning down here .,sport
but i listened brock bower if any raider fan i am pretty sure guy that picked them up what i am saying ?,sport
it is on the in the tight end space .,sport
i got one thing this year .,sport
brock bower is definitely a guy to to look into .,sport
did chief had a top two defense last three year .,sport
it is also worth noting that they are one of the top highest scoring defense in the nfl .,sport
and thats why it is important .,sport
even when you have the goat on your team defense win championship .,sport
this team including the coach is being carried by the defense and the head coach while they are being decimated on the offensive side of the field ball .,sport
they called karim hunt .,sport
he wa sitting on the freaking bench and said hey bro you still remember the playbook ?,sport
what are you doing ?,sport
sitting chilling watching maury. . come on up man .,sport
come on up .,sport
he he kicked the dust off and he he did good his first week .,sport
it is what they can do man .,sport
they are freaking andy reed is brilliant man but that defense she he said cheese had top two defense in the last three year .,sport
and chris is a monster .,sport
we got two more game we want to talk about .,sport
i am sure dare is going to have some good nugget of the day with these two in dallas cowboy at san francisco 49ers and the giant at pittsburgh steelers .,sport
well start off with the dallas cowboy at san francisco 49ers .,sport
they are saying to sit deck prescott .,sport
it depends on who you have on the bench .,sport
i i that that hasnt been great this season but from fantasy standpoint he going to throw the ball and he going to throw it a lot .,sport
now daven cook is going to make his debut today against the 49ers .,sport
that could help him out or it could be a lot of the same .,sport
you got these older running back man who been who been very inconsistent over year but either catching on to a team or getting reps. period with him and zeke elliott .,sport
and then you have dotto thats there cd lamb going to get the ball man .,sport
let listen for the weakest part of the 49ers is that secondary .,sport
everyone know that .,sport
unless they are going to double and triple team cd lambo even then thats going to force that ball down the field .,sport
i do not see why .,sport
if for whatever reason i would think that dak would be somebody go to when in term of being a starting quarterback on their team .,sport
but if you have somebody else thats a better option than dak which would be weird why unless it is a two quarterback fantasy league i would still start dak but there some noticeable point and well go over those in the moment .,sport
well jump into the new york giant pittsburgh steelers where they are saying to sit or i am sorry start najee hair .,sport
dallas often showed big improvement after the last buy last season .,sport
and the cowboy hope the same happens this year .,sport
they ranked 20th in scoring after leading the league in two thousand and twenty three but press guard ha finished a a top ten qb once over six game this season .,sport
and san francisco opponent have the fourth lowest passer rating of seventy eight.seven .,sport
the cowboy have the eighth lowest implied team total of twenty.five point during a week with many qb alternative .,sport
there there there the other side to it .,sport
i could see that .,sport
we got to look at forty nine or two on the office man brought party out without iu who blew his acl .,sport
it is the acl or achilles wanted to but he out for the year .,sport
he going to have to lean on guy jenin and pyrrhusaw and it is it is kiddo plan this week .,sport
he he been on the injury list almost every game .,sport
i do not know if i do not have them .,sport
debos debos ha been struggling debo ha been struggling with he had a pneumonia situation correct ?,sport
he in the hospital .,sport
they are going to be run heavy i guess .,sport
and dallas is terrible against the run boy .,sport
ill tell you. . man ill tell you what let let get into the giant at pittsburgh .,sport
now let me tell you this one thing boy .,sport
i am or boy cause brandon ha it came back yet .,sport
i havent hit bridge or scoreboard but anyways yeah .,sport
the giant the giant a a whole ha impressed me especially with their quarterback being a flat out bum why they kept him when they had option to go ahead and grab somebody else in this draft is beyond me .,sport
other than is there something to the the fact of maybe it have a little bit of pride at stake or something and and keeping him and saying i can make this work .,sport
thats why you think it wa there .,sport
i think they paid them .,sport
the fact that they paid them and they they paid them a lot .,sport
and i guess they felt they had a lot more pressing need at other position and they felt if they felt a lot of the bear man felt with justin they felt if they can put a lot more around him hell be better .,sport
listen daniel jones ha a playoff victory .,sport
he meant to the playoff .,sport
he ha a playoff victory .,sport
it is not the only thing only thing missing from him is consistency and being healthy .,sport
and i think a lot of his inconsistency ha come from him being hurt .,sport
i do not i do not him but maybe thats what i am not in love with .,sport
but if you are in a situation the giant you have to you paid them much money you have to lean on them for a while .,sport
sometimes we forget that the money doe have to do with it .,sport
but ive seen where some big money get cut and they absorb it and that there some big big baller move out there where this what pack your bag .,sport
and that money they are done .,sport
usually when it happens that way they have someone else in mind .,sport
they do not they do not have anybody else over there .,sport
and this is a big problem a systemic problem .,sport
i think this is the start of looking at everything a a whole with the new york giant .,sport
call it what it is .,sport
they made the wrong move by signing daniel and not paying barclay .,sport
thats in hindsight man .,sport
i get rid of barclay .,sport
yeah but theyve had them theyve had them for long and they havent been he hasnt made them what they want them to be .,sport
at the time when at the time when they decided to sign daniel jones he had came off a playoff victory .,sport
they felt he wa on the incline up the up climb .,sport
what ? .,sport
he had he had a decent year .,sport
he had three thousand yard year .,sport
he wa very his image interception were very low .,sport
and he looked man .,sport
i want to touch on what j2k said because it is before the game .,sport
we still got a few hour but it is important because this is a chicago bear show and this is good to know .,sport
washington rookie left tackle .,sport
brandon coleman is out today .,sport
he wa the starter .,sport
thats thats important to know especially for our defense and protection a far a jaden doe that move ?,sport
doe that move the needle at all ?,sport
whether jared jaden start or mariota what would you say about that blindside ?,sport
would that move for you at all ?,sport
darius if you are the you are the coach ?,sport
if i am thinking about the future then i would see it .,sport
jaden but i always if you want to win you want to have your best player on the field now .,sport
washington is the first place in the division .,sport
and they want to do whatever it take to keep that going .,sport
in order to do that you have to have your best player on the field .,sport
if he ready to play let them roll .,sport
now with the with the left tackle being out listen dan is very lucid .,sport
he going to find a way to get around the pocket get outside the pocket and get loose and he not going to sit back there and hold it for a long time .,sport
if you watch him he going to sit back there for a minute .,sport
if that first read is not there more than likely you are going to try to get up out of there .,sport
we do not have to worry about the table tennis face daniel said that now .,sport
and what ?,sport
he kill you with rushing get yard too because thats what i am saying .,sport
if he get up out of that pocket and start making play with his foot .,sport
it is it is very listen it is very what i am saying ?,sport
it is a huge let down to a defense .,sport
when it reacts and whether he going to slide if he going to run out of bound or what he going to do with these rib you are going to protect him and be gun shy about getting any hit .,sport
you are definitely going to want to run but what do you do ?,sport
it is going to be interesting to see how he play with this .,sport
ill be looking into that .,sport
thats important to me to oversee what he doe .,sport
i said i feel he going to be around the league for a while .,sport
yeah let check it out .,sport
unless he absorbs a lot of injury and the rib is first to many i hope it doesnt happen but something to take a pain and look at for sure man .,sport
he not trying to anything this man .,sport
he dealt with this and lsu a . yeah .,sport
he had a rib injury before .,sport
it is one against it wa it wa later in the year they planned a conference schedule and he got hurt but he stayed in the game .,sport
staying the game and listen sec is where the physical defense are and he made it through it .,sport
he going to have injury this because he run .,sport
he run with determination but he not very he not very big guy .,sport
he a tall guy but it is very very light .,sport
light you are very very small frame .,sport
i think he need to bulk up put some some weight on for sure .,sport
getting back to the giant pittsburgh steelers start najee harris .,sport
george pickens get a huge fantasy boost with russell wilson starting .,sport
he sharing snap with jalen warren but percentage of run against the light box is nearly double compared to his time with justin field .,sport
the giant have allowed the ninth most scheduled adjusted fantasy point to running back and the steelers are six point home favorite .,sport
monday night they are saying starting najee harris make it .,sport
i added one to my team last night if i am not mistaken because i feel he going to be saying he going to be pretty good after backfield catch a pass on check now such thing of that nature .,sport
but yeah pickens she ever see the boost because the secondary for the giant those corner in in in particular now the giant a far a the pas rush they get they can get there .,sport
they got some guy up front also with the linebacker .,sport
they are pretty good but i think what hurt wa hurting the giant more than anything is that offensively man .,sport
it is twelve oclock .,sport
the the noon game are starting .,sport
you guy can get into sunday .,sport
weve all been waiting this whole week not for the bear but the nfl and the five month of football go fast .,sport
he say he see a upset giant may win .,sport
getting back to the the bear game .,sport
he said he could see daniel staying in the pocket more .,sport
it should free up a spy linebacker for u . thats good news .,sport
i that .,sport
stay in the pocket more and not running out because you got to protect them rib .,sport
ac adam say got ta hit them rib when they get to him .,sport
thats football man .,sport
thats the name of his strategy .,sport
you got to go for for whats easy .,sport
and thats easy there .,sport
remember guy the zebra doesnt change the stripe .,sport
when you out there on that football field you go to instinct .,sport
yeah for sure .,sport
whats going on .,sport
hey the only thing we can do if you decide to creep out there is make them pay a much a possible .,sport
i think we are all in agreement with that .,sport
if it is a resounding let get after him type approach with our fan at least .,sport
key say neighbor is back lawrence in burn and thabadou will get to wilson .,sport
listen getting to wilson is one thing but trusting daniel jones versus thats still a defense man .,sport
try i am trying to go to trying to stay on on topic with the bear and then they get in the chat and switch back over to what we were talking earlier .,sport
it is a weird what we are figuring this fantasy out there .,sport
hey man for the people out there if you got a couple of dollar to blow what i am saying ?,sport
hey if you are unlucky go for it .,sport
make sure you hit that underdog fantasy and put in the promo code csp boy .,sport
i want to lean with ac here man but man jacksonville ha been bad against the past .,sport
they do not go bad .,sport
where did i put my pick at ?,sport
wa that the wa that the main thread ?,sport
i think no i think i put them in both .,sport
you put them in both .,sport
i want to go over those quickly guy .,sport
that it i said the promo code for underdog fantasy .,sport

they are bad .,sport
say brandon you you posted your pick from yesterday .,sport
the one you sent yesterday .,sport
i am going to do it now .,sport
yeah keep them entertained for a minute .,sport
and i am all give me two more minute .,sport
a far a our bear people caught and people call me crazy but i feel if we keep name in their pocket and force them to throw that ball deep well have a lot of success .,sport
let me see who wa in the chat .,sport
lawrence and burn and tivito .,sport
they may get the wilson .,sport
keith you got me thinking though i do not trust daniel jones .,sport
shout out to everybody thats participated today .,sport
hope you guy enjoy this first lady game .,sport
it is it is twelve and one oclock slate .,sport
and get ready to be ready for some football .,sport
three your time for your time for my time .,sport
three oclock your time for my time .,sport
commander versus bear .,sport
here our first pick that weve got on here .,sport
underdog high and low .,sport
thats what it is .,sport
it is pretty simplistic .,sport
you pick who going to go high .,sport
who going to go low .,sport
i picked cj stroud to get over one.five touchdown .,sport
if it get two touchdown passing then you get that pick .,sport
and each pick that you get it multiplies .,sport
you can go up to forty five.sixty four time with some of these and even higher .,sport
sikwan barkley i got over seventy nine and a half rushing yard .,sport
and if i get that i went high on that not low .,sport
i went a high on all these .,sport
but bajon robinson sixty five and a half yard .,sport
i feel a little bit more comfortable about that than sikwan .,sport
but i think thats a good thing .,sport
i feel a little bit more comfortable about that than sikwan .,sport
but cincinnati been stinking up the joint .,sport
thats why i went ahead and went with that .,sport
cd lamb i went seventy seven and a half .,sport
jalen hertz and thats in receiving yard obviously .,sport
because you can get both .,sport
you can do a wager darius know this .,sport
you can do a wager where you get receiving and rushing yard .,sport
and that would be a higher number in the 90 or something that .,sport
whatever versus seventy seven and a half .,sport
jalen hertz two hundred and twenty one.five yard passing .,sport
thats very thats very easy to do .,sport
thats pedestrian type number a far a a quarterback .,sport
i felt comfortable going that way .,sport
same with joe buro two hundred and thirty nine and a half .,sport
i felt very comfortable with that .,sport
hence joe buro when he hot he can sling it and go over three hundred .,sport
but twenty two hundred and thirty nine.five is logical .,sport
again this is some a strategy .,sport
i do not have any insider .,sport
it is me trying to go with it and having a little bit of fun .,sport
marchase sixty nine and a half again pedestrian for him .,sport
if he can do that great .,sport
ive seen him go much higher than that .,sport
i felt comfortable with that .,sport
field goal kicker this one got me but i went ahead because field goal kicker have been doing a lot this year and two.five .,sport

jordan mason seventy eight and a half .,sport
i that one for san francisco .,sport
thats another sean pick .,sport
james cook i got a discount there with james cook .,sport
that slash there ?,sport
it wa at one.fifty nine and a half .,sport
my discount dropped them all the way down to forty one and a half .,sport
i used my discount on james cook versus seattle .,sport
nujoku fifty eight and a half yard receiving .,sport
i that one .,sport
and jaden reed at sixty six and a half .,sport
i got that one for rushing and receiving yard total .,sport

i picked the eagle to win yesterday but it is not the bengal here that defense is terrible .,sport
they got they need to they need to rehire new staff on that whole defense .,sport
it is overdone overdue and yeah no t higgins yesterday obviously hindered the offense .,sport
they got to pay the receiver too .,sport
it is a sticky situation and they do not have brian calvin cal calhans cal calhans doing a horrible job in tennessee but i think he more suited for a an offensive coordinator and i think he had a good relationship with joe burrow .,sport

yo welcome to the bout sport podcast on the second win sport medium network .,sport
it is your boy see a fantastic alongside .,sport
who you hear with your boy reggie .,sport
hey you already know .,sport
and it is got one thing to say to the people .,sport
man yeah who we thought they were bro .,sport
and what we thought they were man a good defense .,sport
good quarterback .,sport
all around good team bro .,sport
but we said we thought we wa better .,sport
and throughout the whole game we showed we a better team .,sport
and down to how it came down to .,sport
but it is what it is .,sport
you got to win the way you win .,sport
what you think about the game bro ?,sport
they always thought they were they defense .,sport
surprised me even though we were supposed to score a little bit more point than what we scored .,sport
penalty held u back .,sport
couple drop pass held u back .,sport
but they defense still stopped u a couple of time forced punt .,sport
we say it all the time frankie louvre .,sport
hey he had me and this is trying to talk about watch out .,sport
watch out .,sport
watch out .,sport
a you are in a bucket .,sport
i wa in that joint .,sport
i wa in here going off bro .,sport
yeah frankie louvre showed out wagner too .,sport
i think i think it came to a point where they got that one .,sport
that i say thats swift one .,sport
that that that got u . and then that that third and fourth answer that we did not go for when jaden he wa down an inch before the first down and it gave a good feel for this .,sport
to get that last one .,sport
i small scale think he got that for real .,sport
i wa i got that .,sport
that wa always lord .,sport
i think i think that hurt score .,sport
i think he scored that touchdown .,sport
they called that .,sport
yeah it wa a few little joint that i wa come on man .,sport
but thats what it is .,sport
you get over there having it up playing with j. and honey ours again .,sport
hey one hundred hour again defensively i want to give a big shout out to johnny newton bro .,sport
he stepped in .,sport
he stepped up that day .,sport
he showed why he wa should have been the first round up .,sport
but thanks .,sport
i thought he stepped up .,sport
the whole defense stepped up .,sport
secondary most of the game what i am saying ?,sport
mine is that st. juice penalty at the end which i wa i said i felt it wasnt a catchable pas but he did grab him a little .,sport
he wa more the route that made him grab him .,sport
it wa a vicious route .,sport
yeah i would .,sport
but overall good one .,sport
and the train keep on rolling .,sport
yeah it is a needed it but we did not .,sport
we it is no way we should have been .,sport
we could have lost .,sport
we should have lost that game .,sport
even romo and then wa we sitting here at the end of the game and chicago might walk away with this game and theyve been outplayed the whole game what i am saying ?,sport
we outplayed them the whole game .,sport
but but we outplayed them .,sport
i think it wa he had thirty nine passing yard to j. and two hundred and it wa only nine to zero nine to nothing. . it is all .,sport
all we playing with food now .,sport
thats how we need .,sport
we needed we needed to get a touchdown early in the game .,sport
probably first second court .,sport
i said it is going to be a race to twenty .,sport
i knew we will hold them under twenty .,sport
and i am we got to probably get about twenty .,sport
this is a race to twenty .,sport
whoever get twenty win the game .,sport
and i wasnt even thinking about that .,sport
i wa if we if we could have scored .,sport
if we would have made that field goal that on the wild on the field goal that it wa a shame .,sport
he shanked it .,sport
if we would have made that i felt the game wa over .,sport
if we could have got one more score of course before the hail mary i felt the game wa over and wa over .,sport
but we couldnt get the score and we couldnt get a first down to it .,sport
when we punted we giving them good field position .,sport
yeah thats a key .,sport
enough field position for one or two first down put you in close to the red zone .,sport
i think i think it would have got a touchdown on that .,sport
it is the keyest joint .,sport
they are not on that play that would have .,sport
that would have pushed u to what thirteen nothing and that could have changed the whole game plan for them .,sport
but because then they wouldnt have been able to hit .,sport
they would never .,sport
god they were still able .,sport
they were still able to run the ball and do everything that one touchdown .,sport
thats out the door .,sport
you aint handed it to swiss no more .,sport
and it is going to be up to what it is on caleb .,sport
it is on caleb .,sport
and at that point caleb he he did not have confidence in his own offense .,sport
the whole day .,sport
it wa i can not do nothing .,sport
all over his face .,sport
he i can not do nothing .,sport
he tried nothing .,sport
one thing i will say caleb got a little more dog in him than i thought because they wa they wa they wa they wa cracking them .,sport
they wa hitting them .,sport
they wa hitting .,sport
they wa hitting them all around and he kept he kept fighting .,sport
he kept fighting .,sport
i give caleb that credit a far a to me to me he wa fighting because the defense kept you in it .,sport
now any moment and point in time that defense would have gave up seven hundred and fourteen .,sport
they would have went behind the eight ball .,sport
i think it would have been different .,sport
but your defense out there fighting and fighting .,sport
and it is i could get a touchdown .,sport
those three here we back in the game .,sport
he not never he not never completely depleted because of the defense making play or u not making play or whatever the case may have been .,sport
now i say we started out the game .,sport
early in the game beeprod wa cooking then the bear they adjusted or whatever and started to load the box up and shut beeprod down and it wa put the game more on jadens arm .,sport
you think jaden wa the same a far a what we seen previously .,sport
and i know even i think tony rowan wa saying the velocity of his pass .,sport
it wa some pretty good pass wa dropped .,sport
it wa it wa a lot of drop but that one the zach erz across the middle that came up a little short might have had something to do with that .,sport
it wa it wa a couple .,sport
it wa a couple of time where i am even the go for it at the end of they are pushed for it for at the end of the first half ?,sport
it wa i think they do not want them .,sport
they do not want to risk them too much .,sport
it wa a few time where i wa i did think he wa faking i think he wa faking .,sport
i think he wa faking the fact that he wa because he looked even when he took the couple hit it wa he did not have no reaction on his face .,sport
but he got hit one time and he wa i saw early they ran them they ran them early which .,sport
i can not be too mad at if they felt he he wa he wa he healthy what i am saying ?,sport
they ran them early and i wa and i saw a soon a he jumped out the outside and he grabbed it wa an immediate reaction to grab at his rib .,sport
that it wa too bad because he ended up twenty one for thirty eight for three hundred twenty six .,sport
i think thats the most you ask me through for on the season .,sport
but i think i think that .,sport
his running threat in the red zone .,sport
thats what open up the red zone more for u . and i do not think that that running threat wa there a much they did not want to use it a much today which is understandable .,sport
i think that could have been the case .,sport
or every time we get down there we get a penalty that put u back five yard having many yard and then it changed the play .,sport
it changed the scenario .,sport
it changed what we wanted to do now .,sport
we can not do that .,sport
we have to do something else .,sport
i said again i wish currie terry had that breakaway .,sport
another one .,sport
look i say man first thing i thought about wa very rich .,sport
i said my god i said come on you got to make me write something .,sport
i said jay jayden when the dude came in his ankle .,sport
jumped up out of that joint ?,sport
i said come on terry man you got to come on .,sport
you got to you got to figure out a way .,sport
but it is every time it a lot today .,sport
it a lot today when currie terry come back on them come back or come across the middle he catch it and he go down .,sport
and i am listen baby it is time to be a playmaker .,sport
it is time to it is time to listen .,sport
it is time to one two one two move and try to try to take it .,sport
he he he he he got hand .,sport
but i want that that extra from him .,sport
maybe if he give u that extra then we will not need that number two .,sport
we need number two .,sport
i would need number two .,sport
but the little know man is being our number two now .,sport
salute to noah but he had some key drop today that that that that that store drive to man .,sport
he had two drop that we needed .,sport
we needed them pass .,sport
and at that time i wa .,sport
man see this is why we need to get cooper man .,sport
this is why we need to get cooper .,sport
but yeah salute to noah for for saving grace with that .,sport
hell game this though .,sport
it is i say and ive been saying it when in week one .,sport
it is showing our turnaround .,sport
i say i say about the chief the chief know how to win almost any type of scenario in the in the football game .,sport
they know how to win if they throw no touchdown get penalty .,sport
my home full pick even though that would never probably happen .,sport
but they know how to win .,sport
they know how to come out with a w. and thats what we did today .,sport
we had penalty .,sport
i the frustration on jay .,sport
and jay wa wa frustrated a lot because we call it early timeouts .,sport
yeah thats another thing .,sport
killed this in the second half .,sport
yeah we call it early timeouts .,sport
and jay and it on his face .,sport
and i am play through it .,sport
it is time to play through it .,sport
it is time to play through it .,sport
and when they score i am we got to play through it .,sport
play through it .,sport
grant this is the first time with that .,sport
first time i seen jayton do that too a far a show visible frustration because that wasnt the first time it happened on that .,sport
that wasnt the first time it happened .,sport
and he wa mad the first time it happened .,sport
but then when it happened again he all now i am going to say what blew me ?,sport
i do not they are going to have to do something with this rule ?,sport
the substitution rule .,sport
yeah no how they had the substitution when when you substitute on offense .,sport
but they call the false thought on u . and they call the false thought but the ref the ref wasnt even set .,sport
the play can not go off the ref not set .,sport
and then i seen time when the ref get out the way it is three second on the clock on the play clock .,sport
it is it get to a point where it is at ten second what i am saying ?,sport
if yall aint served yet then yall going it is going to be where it is going to be .,sport
that might have to be the new rule .,sport
because that that rule is given the defense too much power to control the time on the offense .,sport
that job the job been blowing me a past couple of week for real .,sport
they go they i think they are going to see it .,sport
they going to try to tweak it around .,sport
come next year .,sport
competition committee and get in get involved on that .,sport
and there .,sport
but a man that in the office .,sport
it is what it is ?,sport
it is what it is .,sport
one one through for three but three twenty six the other one through for one thirty one ten for twenty four for one thirty one .,sport
and that one .,sport
what a hundred ninety seven ninety nine .,sport
ninety nine yard of that came in the fourth life .,sport
when they wa fighting to get get back in and take on and take the lead. . yeah it is visible .,sport
he looked all four game .,sport
he looked he looked erratic .,sport
he did not have to look all season .,sport
this chicago bear game wa a chicago bear game .,sport
how theyve been playing all season defense .,sport
and they defense gave caleb an extra win in that last quarter the last couple of drive to where all caleb need is one or two drive a game .,sport
but you run up to a team you run up to the day .,sport
then you are going to need more than one or two .,sport
yeah i think that .,sport
think the football guy wa looking down on u day bro .,sport
we can not .,sport
we can not .,sport
we can not have this .,sport
this can not happen bro .,sport
it can not .,sport
it can not .,sport
it can not .,sport
we want them to do a park ha one week .,sport
hey i am a show .,sport
i am a show bro .,sport
i am when lose we got show but it would have been it would have been it would have been sad .,sport
man it would have been this one would have been this one would have hurt man .,sport
he now you you hold chicago to two for two for twelve on third down .,sport
they couldnt do nothing .,sport
they couldnt do absolutely nothing .,sport
they get caleb thrown it to the fan .,sport
through three quarter .,sport
we probably should have .,sport
it should have been twenty eight .,sport
it should have been twenty eight .,sport
the first drive be rob got u down there .,sport
stardust three .,sport
scurry terry got the bomb .,sport
stardust three .,sport
every time .,sport
but we need to work on though .,sport
soon a he hit that sweep i said man we struggle bad with sweep .,sport
yeah we always struggle with sweep jet sweep any sweep bro .,sport
we struggle with them joint .,sport
what we need though ?,sport
i am going to tell you i said i said last year we shouldnt never get rid of sweat .,sport
mark he fast .,sport
hey slam the how much of a difference maker that man is bro ?,sport
he fast .,sport
and i knew he wa fast with u . but it is he picked up some side .,sport
he aint .,sport
but he aint lose the speed .,sport
and i think it is a prize j. because j. and honestly thought he could outrun him on the edge .,sport
two time that he caught .,sport
he caught .,sport
he probably wa you you fast .,sport
why we get rid of you ?,sport
thats what i said .,sport
i said at that time man i am bro i would trade .,sport
i am fine with getting rid of chase at this point whatever i wanted to keep one of them to though .,sport
and i wa i want to keep sweat but salute to sweat .,sport
man he still balling .,sport
would you trade sweat for one of those detacles we got ?,sport
which one ?,sport
because sweat is only going to be worth two of those .,sport
and it is even the wrong pain of jonathan .,sport
would you trade one of those two to make it ?,sport
because i think i think i think johnny could hold down the other one. . what i am saying ?,sport
johnny johnny showed the data he could what i am saying ?,sport
he could he could do this .,sport
yeah i would .,sport
and even without johnny with ridgeway it wa .,sport
i still want to talk about .,sport
we have to have that edge .,sport
we got to have that edge russia that that that that .,sport
that bona fide past russia .,sport
thats why i am willing to trade up to a second round the full one now at this point .,sport
because that that that take much pressure off your secondary .,sport
if you got a weak secondary what i am saying ?,sport
it take a little bit of pressure off of them knowing that .,sport
we are going to be able to get there .,sport
we are secondary because the past couple game i honestly do not think they garbage me personally .,sport
i think we average in the back .,sport
i do not think we do not have no game change .,sport
we do not got no pure shutdown .,sport
but i think they are all good at what they do .,sport
it is been arguing playing .,sport
i think it is what i do .,sport
yeah and thats what it is .,sport
and thats thats what i wa about to say .,sport
a much a i got a love hate relationship .,sport
for benji st. juice i feel if we can get a playmaker in his back .,sport
and keep everything else in place .,sport
i feel that change our secondary .,sport
yeah but see i think st. juice with st. juice i say that is saying he not a bull .,sport
he might get got a couple of time .,sport
but for the most part he going to give you decent coverage .,sport
he going to be in this .,sport
to me he is when he get beat and when he feel out of place he get handsy and we get penalty .,sport
and thats what i am even these day more wa cry because he wa shutting shutting them down for for the game .,sport
but it wa one player saying if he got handsy with him but caleb got rid of the ball and completed it too fast .,sport
and if he would have waited i felt they would have got the call .,sport
but because he threw the ball quickly it wa simultaneously where i do not let that go .,sport
but he played good .,sport
he played good .,sport
i think i think he a he a he a all corner .,sport
i am going to say he great .,sport
he not a pro bowler nothing crazy but i think he all .,sport
i think we got all up front and make him look better .,sport
you get a little pas rush thatll help him .,sport
but me i want to go for both .,sport
i want one each what i am saying ?,sport
but you can not i do not want to trade everything .,sport
now i i wa pegging this game a the a the breakout for my man forbes he can not get out there .,sport
and i wa and thats another thing what i realized what we do is some day some player going to play there and some day .,sport
yeah thats what they say .,sport
they say if they they they set people up for his compared to the matchup they maybe they thought that these receiver they wasnt and i see what it is they saw which is smart .,sport
they did not play much zone .,sport
they they they they rushed a lot to get the kayla .,sport
may caleb russia made him have to get the ball up by his hand which wa smart .,sport
whats the sex we get today ?,sport
sex i think we got two .,sport
i think we only got two .,sport
yeah two .,sport
but there wa a lot of pressure a lot of pressure .,sport
but thats caleb wa a magician back there bro .,sport
i wa they got it .,sport
no how you get out of that ?,sport
caleb got out of a lot back there man .,sport
he got out of one of them .,sport
he couldnt get away when he went one on one with frankie .,sport
you remember that ?,sport
court of an awesome .,sport
get away from that one .,sport
to my man down yeah but caleb he he more lucid in that pocket than i thought he wa man .,sport
i wa i knew he could move around it but i know i know his awareness his pocket awareness wa that that i call him more fear .,sport
then awareness because he wa running for his life .,sport
he wa running for his life .,sport
but we couldnt get him .,sport
but you say a hundred of them you all came in the fourth quarter .,sport
no you werent completing nothing .,sport
he couldnt do nothing .,sport
i think he wa looking at the pressure come most of the first half .,sport
wheres coming from this time ?,sport
let me see how i am how i am going to get out of here .,sport
because he knew it wa coming .,sport
and to hold them out .,sport
i do not know how many first down they got early but they went on them two drive late in the fourth quarter .,sport
and we held them the 15th first .,sport
man you got that one .,sport
you go to me you said man deandre swift he he got .,sport
look thats all you got to look for .,sport
i am here in the .,sport
little music that you play .,sport
but it is cool .,sport
yeah. . what wa you saying about swift ?,sport
no no no i said we had to had to watch out for .,sport
and but thats he had a good game .,sport
i had to have to switch .,sport
the yeah yeah swift wa swift wa cooking swift wa cooking .,sport
yeah that it wa it wa mainly that run though .,sport
it wa a lot to do with that run. . and our defense i do not know what it i think .,sport
we wa more focused on stopping that pas maybe with caleb .,sport
and getting pressure on him that we wasnt a focused on the run game. . yeah i do not know .,sport
think swift wa nobody had to do .,sport
he got got through .,sport
he got through .,sport
got through with u and had that long run .,sport
but yeah i want to go around the league though .,sport
do want to go around the league real quick .,sport
and talk about .,sport
talk about some of these other game that went on .,sport
first i want to talk about them them dolphin .,sport
two came back today .,sport
they played against the cardinal ?,sport
played against the cardinal .,sport
calamari went off twenty six for thirty six for three hundred and seven with two touchdown and two ahead wa twenty eight for thirty eight to thirty four with one .,sport
but want to talk about tour with this one because the dolphin they jumped out to a lead .,sport
and then the cardinal came back .,sport
but do you think tour is that much of a difference maker for them ?,sport
because they look they look a lot better today .,sport
he is a hell of a difference maker for .,sport
they lost in the losing effort he played .,sport
they looked completely better .,sport
yeah completely better .,sport
yes eight chain had one hundred on the ground sixty through the air .,sport
how we had about six for seventy through the air .,sport
a lot of player who wasnt getting involved without them started to get involved .,sport
yeah he opened that offense up man i wa saying last week man .,sport
i do not think he all that .,sport
i think he probably i said probably .,sport
fringe top ten in a league or whatever .,sport
but in that system .,sport
it work with him nothing nobody business .,sport
but he might have made me rethink that the way .,sport
the difference the difference that he make with them .,sport
and i might have to revisit that because man they looked dead in the water most of the year since he been out .,sport
and now they look they .,sport
they aint that bad .,sport
yes they look .,sport
and they lose the effort .,sport
they lose the effort .,sport
i aint looked that bad .,sport
but the baltimore .,sport
how about the next thing i wa going to say baltimore in the brown man .,sport
baltimore lost to the brown twenty four to nine .,sport
lamar jackson had two eighty nine with two touchdown .,sport
jamis winston started for cleveland and got their offense going more than this been all year .,sport
it went twenty seven for forty one for three thirty four .,sport
they also got new play calling new play calling .,sport
yeah no jamis winston for the browns. . he i could tell by his pregame speech that they wa coming out to do something .,sport
he went eating no dub used by you when eating dub .,sport
yeah nah he he had him looking better man .,sport
he had him looking real good .,sport
think the team rally behind him because he somebody who going to push you down the field .,sport
i do not know whats been going on with the sean .,sport
i do not know if the team gave up on him for real or whatever .,sport
but they look they wa out there fighting for jamis .,sport
in baltimore. . they had it .,sport
should have been that game .,sport
should have .,sport
kyle hamilton had an interception .,sport
jamis over through the dude and kyle hamilton had to pick there in his bread basket and dropped it next play touchdown .,sport
and did not get bored of more time to get downfield man .,sport
but yeah cleveland look a lot better .,sport
i am think i wa rooting .,sport
i wa rooting against cleveland because .,sport
i want them to hurry up and go in and get that fire sale we could get denzel ward or .,sport
i am i am wanting to go ahead and go ahead and hurry up and get them folk up out of here man because we all they need to come to this real good situation man .,sport
in the division only division game from early is eagle eagle and bengal man .,sport
how you would think about the eagle ?,sport
i i believe i always feel it is hard to stop a team that ha a running quarterback .,sport
and when you add that a they call him barkley on top of that twenty two for one eight wa safe .,sport
and then of course no jalen score three three i am one .,sport
i think he wanted to he wanted to say why i got him down there .,sport
he wanted to get let say why i get it .,sport
but they they the brotherly shove king man .,sport
thats what they went with .,sport
and borough wa twenty six for thirty seven .,sport
two hundred and thirty four one touchdown one pick .,sport
and yeah jamar chase he had nine nine catch but only fifty four yard .,sport
what what let me ask you what do you think about the eagle ?,sport
cause i said in the last week how sneaky i think the eagle are .,sport
cause they they sitting here they sitting here on our heel .,sport
it is and do before we did what we did today with the hell murray ?,sport
i am man we about to give up number one .,sport
we about to yeah .,sport
i think we still would have had it by half a game .,sport
i think .,sport
because now we both got two .,sport
that would have been our third one .,sport
we would have i do not want to be behind them because they would have had it because how they they game they they game style .,sport
they they run the ball they quank and get them down there .,sport
and when they down in that red zone they probably the hardest team in the nfl to start .,sport
i wa i wa thinking for a much crap a they put serrani they .,sport
wanting to fire him every week .,sport
he keep keeping them in contention .,sport
yall doing this man ?,sport
but shouldnt have let them get safe one .,sport
i know that much because .,sport
safe one having a whole resurgence to his career .,sport
he showing out up there man .,sport
yeah he showing out .,sport
he showing out man .,sport
and then now they got aj brown back .,sport
devonte smith devonte smith finally he had a bad he had it down a couple of week but he showed out today .,sport
thats gon na be we are gon na thats gon na be a battle bro .,sport
thats gon na be a battle man .,sport
take care of business there .,sport
and we go to pittsburgh .,sport
and i am gon na tell you this stat line and i want you to tell me what you think the final score wa in a win or in a loss .,sport
twelve for fifteen eighty five passing yard .,sport
do you think that quarterback won or do you think that quarterback lost ?,sport
twelve for fifteen .,sport
eighty five with a head to be lost though but .,sport
i know you asked for reason .,sport
that quarterback that quarterback won fifty two to fourteen .,sport
there you go .,sport
thats crazy .,sport
thats crazy .,sport
he had three touchdown but yeah had three touchdown .,sport
fifteen eighty five yard .,sport
there that wa all for what ?,sport
i think they ran back a special team kick or punt kick .,sport
theys listening .,sport
khalifa raymond with a ninety yard punt punt return .,sport
all short pass .,sport
the porter for three yard pas touchdown same round for one yard joint .,sport
rock for eight .,sport
yall said last day they ballin .,sport
no they did not .,sport
they are bad at the nfc .,sport
look because they got a nice they got good defense .,sport
to go on top of being able to only throw for eighty five yard .,sport
thats ridiculous .,sport
nah they they they clicking on all cylinder bro .,sport
they clicking on all cylinder man .,sport
defense got two pick on mason rudolph today .,sport
rudolph went twenty two for thirty eight for two hundred and sixty six .,sport
but man tennessee one of them team .,sport
they one of them team looking for one of these footer back .,sport
number one number one drive pick .,sport
fighting for one of these .,sport
this number one pick .,sport
try to get a quarterback even i say i said before not sold on none of these quarterback this year coming out .,sport
if i wa a team i start taking for for arch or something try to get that man in blood line .,sport
we going to be garbage next year too .,sport
we going to be garbage next year too .,sport
cause yeah thats but yeah man .,sport
who else wa earlier you had ?,sport
yeah the jet .,sport
jet who can not get .,sport
i know devonte adam is hurt bro .,sport
he he done left one situation to go to another situation and it is he can not get to a good situation to save his life .,sport
thats exactly what it is the situation .,sport
yeah it is bad .,sport
it alludes to the patriot .,sport
when drake may went out with a head injury brissette came in went fifteen for twenty four one hundred and thirty two .,sport
and rogers there go seventeen for twenty eight for two hundred and thirty three .,sport
but the patriot came in though won in the game .,sport
and he came in and won in the game man .,sport
he keep getting these situation .,sport
and doing good .,sport
he he looked he should be the starter .,sport
he prized he better than drake .,sport
he did start the year a the starter and they wasnt that .,sport
it aint i aint can not be too mad .,sport
but yeah he better than drake may at this point now .,sport
they it is one of those situation where joe flacco coming for the coach and look he better than anthony richardson at time .,sport
he is better than he is better than anthony richardson .,sport
hey i do not know .,sport
maybe they want to develop .,sport
they want to develop drake and i get it because they not looking to be world leader now .,sport
and but drake may have sold raw to me .,sport
thats why i did not him coming out the draft because i did not his teeth .,sport
he got that .,sport
the arm is ridiculous .,sport
but i did not his tape .,sport
i did not his decision making .,sport
i did not his progression .,sport
i did not there a lot of thing i did not about drake which is why i wa i aint drake probably be my fifth quarterback that i would .,sport
he wa probably fifth for me .,sport
and it wa probably only fifth because wouldnt i probably would have had him over both next deal .,sport
he probably fifth .,sport
do you think if the best and go back would they drag would they still draft caleb number one ?,sport
high side two thousand and twenty no .,sport
i do not think .,sport
i think they i think they know now at this point jaytons better .,sport
not saying in a future caleb can not get what i am saying ?,sport
it is but i think for the situation that the bear wa in with their coach you can look at their coach their gm they are they they damn they lame duck .,sport
they they went all in to win now .,sport
they put all the pressure on caleb to win now .,sport
and caleb is not prepared for that now .,sport
four or five year from now caleb might be the next pack my home .,sport
but to put that on him now no he not prepared for that .,sport
thats more of a situation where jayton wa more prepared for .,sport
jayton wa more to work on with caleb than what you got to work on with jayton .,sport
jayton wa more to be put in a situation where you we we ready to push .,sport
you can look at our situation .,sport
we wasnt ready to push .,sport
he put u there .,sport
what you mean ?,sport
look this is what we are going to do .,sport
we might be we might be a little bad this year .,sport
we might win about six seven game .,sport
when we are six seven we gain .,sport
six seven what ?,sport
six seven by we gain .,sport
let me ask you this because it is another player who i did not see on the field today .,sport
going back to the eagle game is jehan doxon .,sport
i saw him on the sideline when they they had a play he came out wa yeah good play .,sport
hey whats up ?,sport
got you playing up there bro .,sport
do you think it could have worked out here with him ?,sport
nah i do not i do not because the play style is not jehans play style .,sport
they want dog they want .,sport
you are going to have to block .,sport
you are going to have to crash into the pile .,sport
you are going to have to what i am saying ?,sport
you are going to have to be physical .,sport
you are going to have to run you got to tasmanian double some stuff .,sport
and jehan more of a finesse pretty game .,sport
i would run this little slick route .,sport
he more of that type .,sport
they do not want that .,sport
that aint going to work .,sport
nah they do not want that .,sport
nah they do not want that .,sport
they want aj brown and debo sandal .,sport
i want aj brown or debo sandal .,sport
maybe maybe we slip up with somebody .,sport
yeah they got to make some money for brock do not they ?,sport
they got to .,sport
they almost got to .,sport
they got to free up some money from brock from somewhere .,sport
they got to pay brock because if they do not pay brock i am a quarterback .,sport
i do not want to go to the san francisco .,sport
what i got to do to get paid .,sport
salute to the people on nbc the ujjaka .,sport
halftime they got hail mary to the command .,sport
hail mary to the command .,sport
i am surprised i still got a voice after saying that .,sport
hey sometimes i wa curking out bad .,sport
i am yeah my name is mad at me now .,sport
they wa curting .,sport
i did not say much stuff joe .,sport
i think i called everybody in my contact book .,sport
everybody wa probably they probably hit him in the nose .,sport
they wa screaming .,sport
the one person who answered wa the eagle fan .,sport
i am sorry but you got to hit this .,sport
you got to hit this one too j. you got to hit this .,sport
hey your man bounced back after last week bad game .,sport
they struggled .,sport
they struggled .,sport
twenty five for twenty seven for two hundred and eighty five .,sport
last week he had what eighty yard ?,sport
last week wa terrible .,sport
but this week i am going to stop using struggle sometimes because they in the nfl and these to field nfl team .,sport
and i the coast win because i say yeah these the game you are going to have to win .,sport
but yeah my colleague coastals four and three coastals four and three coming in .,sport
i would imagine most people would have had the texan winning that game but the coast stayed four and three at least they aint but i can never i could never believe in anthony richie .,sport
and it is sad because he went to florida .,sport
but i can not believe in anthony richardson bro .,sport
he ten for thirty two one hundred and seventy five one touchdown one pick .,sport
but he he not accurate to me man .,sport
now thats why he could throw a hundred yard .,sport
arm is stupid man .,sport
but see thats why i am i do not trust that a much .,sport
i the tape .,sport
thats why i wasnt high on drake may .,sport
because drake got an arm that .,sport
got a arm crazy sip the ball throw every throw and do that .,sport
i the process .,sport
anthony richardson got no accuracy .,sport
he won those player to look good or look good but when they do not look good they look bad .,sport
if that long ball is completing he wa the alec pierce in week one every time he decided to throw it sixty yard down the field it looked good .,sport
but when you throwing bomb after bomb after bomb and it is not being completed it is .,sport
i think i think they wasting the career jonathan taylor too bro .,sport
hank you think he career being wasted ?,sport
bro he a top running back .,sport
and who won the top running back in the league bro ?,sport
it is .,sport
but thats why they got thats why they break them .,sport
how it is .,sport
thats what i wa saying about tennessee with derek henry bro .,sport
tennessee wasted all them year of that dude career bro .,sport
and it is the same situation with jonathan taylor in indianapolis .,sport
jonathan taylor need to go ahead .,sport
see we got braw about you .,sport
who you ?,sport
who you about to say ?,sport
what everybodys super star bro .,sport
matter of fact i love braw .,sport
but but i know .,sport
if i could get somebody over here where i could almost guarantee a hundred plus on the ground again .,sport
jonathan taylor different .,sport
i hope well be able to keep braw a that red zone with great blunt type of road .,sport
thatd be fun .,sport
and have jonathan .,sport
yeah that would be fun .,sport
and keep echola and move him to the nickel .,sport
the nickel wa i wa our third down back .,sport
our third down back .,sport
yeah third down back .,sport
thats it .,sport
third down back .,sport
pas catch him back .,sport
yeah you get hey hey you get we get jonathan taylor with our line and i restops quarterback .,sport
ill be get somebody that .,sport
a i said he started out good .,sport
i said we gon na cook because the best run they got one weakness is that it is their run defense .,sport
i said braw about to cook .,sport
i can see it but they i said they they they they stepped up and they they clamped down on them to hold it down .,sport
but he only had he had sixteen for sixty five .,sport
it is full yard four.one carry or whatever .,sport
but i do not know .,sport
see i tell you i am old school bro .,sport
i remember if you are if you are running back did not get twenty five run .,sport
whats wrong with you ?,sport
running back not the same .,sport
running back not the same .,sport
league aint the same .,sport
we had at the point for this .,sport
in the game we were almost in .,sport
in the game where we had the lead for most of the game jayton almost threw forty time thirty eight time .,sport
the running the running back i think we run two running back .,sport
there wa twenty four twenty four run to running back .,sport
that used to be one running back .,sport
and your backup might get ten .,sport
and thats why i throw twenty five time a game .,sport
and thats why it go back to me .,sport
when i say thats why it is hard to stop .,sport
i can send those running quarterback .,sport
because jayton added another eight run .,sport
it add another what i am trying to say .,sport
for example you said what thirty that old school you released thirty to thirty five touch for a running back. . if i go look at philly say q1 twenty two per ten thats thirty two .,sport
you give game another five .,sport
thats thats and then shipley got two .,sport
thats almost forty curry .,sport
philly philly still keep that old school grinded out style .,sport
they always had they always wa that wa that wa all .,sport
it is always meant philly .,sport
i can not think of a philly quarterback .,sport
something that will be will be a dominant .,sport
will be unstoppable .,sport
and thats when we look our best when echler clicking when b rob clicking when jay able to run in the passing game float off of that .,sport
i did not realize everybody in scary turd popping open running chris rope .,sport
i aint know he had that many rush yard .,sport
i aint realize he wa he wa cracking that many open .,sport
thought they wa following him up but i thought he wa getting locked up for real .,sport
for real .,sport
thats all the game around the league that the falcon falcon beat the buck .,sport
falcon beat the buck .,sport
it wa close .,sport
back at the two pick .,sport
but yeah the buck the injury show .,sport
thats going yeah thats going thats going to hurt .,sport
thats going to hurt too much for them to overcome bro. . let me look and see who wa there .,sport
if you say thats what we said .,sport
i am going to have to be kay bucky .,sport
we have to be aughton .,sport
and richie y. bucky had seven catch for forty .,sport
kay had nine for eighty one .,sport
ive been in that .,sport
it wa there .,sport
for thirty eight .,sport
it wa all two four touchdown .,sport
they do all that .,sport
they only lost by five point .,sport
they bottled up b. john .,sport
thirteen run for sixty four sixty three .,sport
i aint going to say bottled up but they did not run a lot .,sport
the average almost five a pop .,sport
but yeah cal piss came got off .,sport
yeah cal piss .,sport
but he received that tight end .,sport
i feel he should be .,sport
he should average at least sixty yard again .,sport
especially on a on a receiving court .,sport
it is not that strong .,sport
yeah i i am not crazy about them .,sport
they are receiving court .,sport
he he he decent but i said he a good receiver .,sport
to me cal piss is better than drake london .,sport
cal piss is cal piss should be the best tight end in the lead .,sport
skill wise and ability wise .,sport
thats what everybody thought coming out .,sport
but i do not know what it is man .,sport
it is got to be a want to or .,sport
work tactic something .,sport
it is something what cal piss on why he he aint getting it done man .,sport
last thing i want to talk about .,sport
i am going to switch all around .,sport
i am going to switch sport bro .,sport
whats going on with him man ?,sport
see bro i did not step on that floor .,sport
it is easier for me to talk when they not making crazy decision that .,sport
you make it a little bit easier for me to talk to talk about them .,sport
but i have to see .,sport
i have to see because they always come out strong this .,sport
and then once the league starting to heat up i think the warrior might be undefeated too .,sport
but well see .,sport
i what anthony davis doing .,sport
anthony davis is he could be the decent player of the year .,sport
if he play ad plan .,sport
yeah ad plan with a fire on them now .,sport
i want to see if he can stay healthy .,sport
because thats been his whole thing bro .,sport
he come out and he missed half the season because he do not .,sport
thats what i say .,sport
i want to make a move and get another and get another player .,sport
what you need ?,sport
what position ?,sport
if we can get with lebron favorite shooter i still do not feel we have a consistent shooter .,sport
i u to get when we had contiguous car will poke a three and d. yeah .,sport
i am going to play defense and make some three .,sport
because when you play with lebron it is not even about what we want .,sport
it is not even about what we need .,sport
it is about what lebron feel .,sport
what lebron feel is best for the lakers .,sport
let me see who yall can say that again .,sport
what lebron feel lebron feel is best .,sport
i would imagine that they would want dalton connect to be that .,sport
that three point that shooter and then college thats what he shoot .,sport
boy could play .,sport
he nice .,sport
but i am not coming from college to the pro and this is almost any sport especially basketball and football .,sport
you got to come show me .,sport
you got to come show me .,sport
what you did in college look at marquel folk marquel folk wa probably one of the best college player ive seen .,sport
now to cause winning .,sport
i do not think that ive seen but in the past couple maybe five six seven year what he did up in washington wa got him got him got him drafted .,sport
number one .,sport
but it couldnt translate translate .,sport
but thats the thing .,sport
thats the thing .,sport
i say i i could agree with you on that because connect aint it is you look at skill set what i am saying ?,sport
connect aint got no speed .,sport
he aint a physical power .,sport
it is is this going to translate to the next level ?,sport
somebody zion or kyrie ai they got they got a skill set that youd .,sport
my goodness aint going to be to keep up with him .,sport
and thats what you need .,sport
you even need to be you said kyrie irvin or i feel you need to have one specific thing that he do breathe to make it mean .,sport
and you say how you say ronnie need to find that that one thing to stick with .,sport
he do not have that yet .,sport
but i feel if connect going to come in he need to be able to shoot at a higher rate .,sport
he got to he got to he got to he got to make a roll .,sport
he got to make a roll for itself .,sport
look at because you are not having .,sport
god i forget the bad man name every time i think about him play with the hawk wa a three point shooter .,sport
there a lot of them over there with the hawk .,sport
i am saying he played he played with him before though .,sport
he i think he retired now but he wa all he did wa shoot her .,sport
nah that wa him shoot three .,sport
cow cove cow cove .,sport
cow cove .,sport
i could i forget his name every time i think about him .,sport
that man he made a roll for itself .,sport
it is he the dude .,sport
he going to shoot three .,sport
thats becoming a game to do .,sport
thats what the league is .,sport
yeah cow cove up in there .,sport
you need three put them up in and he going to get double when you need the three .,sport
no. . yeah three .,sport
yeah undefeated .,sport
yeah the warrior undefeated this in the west .,sport
yeah the warrior and the thunder .,sport
i the thunder .,sport
are you worried ?,sport
thats all about the a. are you worried because i think the warrior i think they time is .,sport
i think it is the thunder time now .,sport
between thunder and probably still nugget ?,sport
are you worried about the thunder now ?,sport
no the thunder .,sport
the thunder is a great team .,sport
i think they young .,sport
i think that they they need to experience more loss .,sport
to to be able to get over the hump that they do not realize that they are going to hit come play off time because they are going to be a playoff team .,sport
they might finish number one in the west but i do not see them .,sport
i do not see them winning the ship because lack of experience .,sport
of experience .,sport
but i do think i do think the timberwolves .,sport
it is going to be a sneaky team .,sport
because they got rid of big cat .,sport
thats thats thats thats thats upgrade with that .,sport
you saw that you can start with that .,sport
getting ready him wa wa .,sport
but yeah i havent had any .,sport
because because now how far they made it last year .,sport
they know what it take now to get over that hump .,sport
how the celtic the celtic what lost in the easter conference what i am saying ?,sport
a couple year paying back one and a ship they know what it take to get over that hump come play all the time .,sport
they know it is a turtle race and it is not necessarily a sprint .,sport
and a much a i hate to say it but i love to say it because it is my team you can not sleep on lebron eighty .,sport
bron somehow some way he always got the magical moment in him bro .,sport
much a i hate to say it i am an advocate lebron hater what i am saying ?,sport
i respect this game but i always i am gon na root against that dude in everything .,sport
and it is crazy .,sport
i do not know how that how that can .,sport
it is crazy .,sport
it is crazy .,sport
nah i miss the best role player ever to play the game .,sport
i feel you though because if he came to the wizard i would have been the same way .,sport
i can not i can not help u win but i want you to be garbage .,sport
but last thing on the mv i want to ask wiz you think the spur gon na take another step up with wimby and them this year ?,sport
first yeah .,sport
i think the experience that wimby got i say sometimes you got ta take loss to gain the experience and win .,sport
i think the loss that wimby took to the usa team in the olympics is gon na motivate him even more to play harder to understand how he ha to work to understand a lot more about the game .,sport
he gon na come with vengeance in his career not this year .,sport
in his career i wa looking at an interview that wimby did and he wa how he lost respect for nba player because he thought they worked way harder than what they worked .,sport
he wa i thought these guy wa busting eight young men .,sport
i know they work hard .,sport
these dude on the club had to do it .,sport
he said he came to the league and they wa nah some of them work hard but a lot of them do not work a hard .,sport
i the mentality .,sport
i remember going to club down here back in the day man .,sport
now the wiz player on ill be out there sizing them up man i could probably go out .,sport
ill be looking up i could probably go out .,sport
this man .,sport
but nah i think they could take a step up and depending on wimby they could be a threat because chris pol i think he gon na be a big difference maker there for me .,sport
not point not scoring wise leadership wise and facilitating the offense .,sport
i think thats what they needed is somebody who could facilitate .,sport
he gon na get the ball where it need to be .,sport
he gon na set wimby up with the pas that he need .,sport
chang gon na be able to get open shot heard some bar better look what i am saying ?,sport
i think that open it .,sport
it is gon na open it up for them man .,sport
i this first .,sport
i this first .,sport
i think they still gon na need one more piece .,sport
yeah i think they need one more piece pry .,sport
yeah i think they need one more piece .,sport
i think pry .,sport
i do not wimby playing the center .,sport
i do not for the role that you need him to do with the cause wimby is the number one option .,sport
but when you are the number one option and you wimby you you you you tall but you do not have a joe and b type of playing to be getting down there banging with all of those center .,sport
i would for them to i would for them to get a center .,sport
even if it is a brook lopez even if it is a center that where you could slide wimby somewhere else where he not taking a punishment .,sport
you have to check the the and b the joker .,sport
yeah thats gon na be thats gon na be a lot .,sport
and tap on the office and ask him to come around and go dunk on these player or sprint the floor hard or whatever the case may be .,sport
yeah but you think hell be exposed with his long linky self against some of them power forward though ?,sport
no no cause he he he a athletic a them .,sport
thats shit .,sport
they might be exposed .,sport
they better hope he do not come .,sport
yeah plus cause these fall are small .,sport
these fall you got ta think and what you wa saying plus you get cause wimby liked to play around that three point line and stuff that .,sport
he probably been perfect there .,sport
it is it is yonus yonus can go play the center but why would i have him go take that punishment ?,sport
thats brooke there where brooke can stretch the floor and grab rebound take a little bit off of yonus .,sport
then when i need yonus to grab a rebound and sprint the floor hard he able to do that .,sport
they should try to get somebody a i say our boy mcgee or what you call it .,sport
kevin looney or somebody .,sport
yeah i i used to call robert williams .,sport
but yeah hey looney one of them .,sport
yeah somebody that .,sport
yeah i can see that .,sport
i can see that .,sport
and then move everybody down chan could play the two .,sport
they can all go back to natural position cause when we had the bos it is asking a lot for him .,sport
yeah it is asking a lot .,sport
but yeah thats it bro .,sport
thats it for the day .,sport
salute everybody who watching what i am saying ?,sport
and yeah check u out .,sport
shout out to the commander .,sport
shout out to the commander .,sport
hail to the commander .,sport
came out with that dub .,sport

what do you mean now ?,sport
i am saying cause the best fan want to act listen if it is still the best fan out there who think that caleb williams .,sport
i do not even think that they believe that coming into the game .,sport
but if they still believe that after today performance then i commend yall cause i probably said the same thing .,sport
he wa on the command .,sport
i do not know what true but i probably still said the same .,sport
shout out his toughness .,sport
shout out his toughness .,sport
shout out shout out shout out to the commander .,sport
shout out noah brown .,sport
shout out skurry terry mcclellan .,sport

but yo on to the giant .,sport
on to the giant .,sport
it is to be hopefully we playing better .,sport
hopefully we beat them by thirty .,sport
how we supposed to beat them the first time ?,sport
how we supposed to beat them ?,sport
yeah we gon na get them cause our offense clicking now granted they got a kicker now .,sport
there aint gon na be no excuse .,sport
that they do not have no quarterback at all .,sport
they got a kicker with no quarterback .,sport
our defense should cook again .,sport
i am i am i am on top of that .,sport
on top of that .,sport
i want to see i am a whole dog from now on .,sport
i want to see if they gon na start through lock with dan jones .,sport
either way either way do not matter .,sport
and my prediction to this to today game would have been a little bit closer if we did not kick many field goal .,sport
yeah now you wa there a far a u moving the ball or whatever yeah i think i had what twenty seventwenty .,sport
no twenty seven yeah twenty .,sport
i wa thirty year ago .,sport
i had twenty sevenseventeen if jayden played twenty twenty to seventeen if marcus played .,sport
we do our offense and our penalty made their defense look better than what it wa .,sport
i do not want to take everything away though because their defense they play .,sport
i am corner their secondary they played .,sport
and then i say sweat up front wa a difference maker .,sport
sweat played man .,sport
sweat played ball today .,sport
salute to that dude man .,sport
i never wanted you to go my boy .,sport
but we moved the ball easily .,sport
and thats what ive seen .,sport
you said you said that that jamison came in and made a difference for the brown but their defense wa the same .,sport
and we moved the ball easily on them .,sport
we hooked the ground .,sport
we moved it easily on them .,sport
they mightve got a seventy five jaden a day .,sport
but we do not have a back to a couple week from now .,sport
it aint gon na be a hundred next week either .,sport
we got to get used to it .,sport
and how physical the giant game are .,sport
hey we to play .,sport
it is gon na be a dog fight .,sport

but well see all that later this week .,sport
well be back on here later this week .,sport
to preview that giant talk about whatever going on in the nba and in the field .,sport
city that going cowboy they losing now fourteenten .,sport
thats it yall .,sport
peace out .,sport
hey everyone welcome back to a. we are gon na be taking a deep dive into something pretty controversial .,sport
it is france ban on hijab in sport .,sport
and you guy shared an article with u from donian.com and it is all about how the un is taking france to task over this whole thing .,sport
i think this deep dive will be super interesting especially because the paris two thousand and twenty four olympics are around the corner .,sport
the timing is crucial with this .,sport
this is not some abstract debate .,sport
this is about real woman and girl who are being told they can not compete because of what they are choosing to wear .,sport
exactly and the article make it clear that this ban is impacting athlete at all level from aspiring olympian to young girl wanting to play football or soccer with their friend .,sport
it go beyond football too .,sport
the french basketball federation also ha a very similar ban in place .,sport
let get to the heart of it .,sport
why is france doing this ?,sport
to understand that we need to understand this concept called lélysée dêtre .,sport
which is the french approach to secularism. . and it is much stricter than what we see in a lot of other country .,sport
imagine it this way .,sport
the government want to be completely neutral when it come to religion. . a referee in a game they are not picking side .,sport
that make sense .,sport
but how doe that connect to banning the hijab in sport ?,sport
the french government argues that allowing any outward religious symbol the hijab in a public space the sporting event go against this whole idea of neutrality .,sport
they see it a blurring the line between state and religion .,sport
to them the sport field should be a space where everyones religious belief are essentially invisible .,sport
in their eye it is about making sure that everyones treated equally regardless of their religion .,sport
but the un is calling foul on that ?,sport
they are saying that these band are discriminatory .,sport
the un is arguing that by singling out the hijab france is preventing muslim woman or girl from fully participating in society. . think about it .,sport
you are about to go to a basketball game with your friend .,sport
one of them is told she can not play because of her headscarf .,sport
how doe that make you feel ?,sport
yeah no it would make me question the fairness of the whole thing .,sport
and the article specifically mention that there a group of eight independent un expert appointed by the human right council who are making this criticism .,sport
it sound they are not pulling any punch .,sport
yeah thats .,sport
these expert are pretty much the un heavy hitter when it come to human right issue .,sport
and they are saying that by banning the hijab france is limiting freedom of expression and denying these woman and girl an equal chance to participate based solely on their religious belief .,sport
it is we have a bit of a headtohead here .,sport
france say the hijab disrupts neutrality while the un say the ban itself is discriminatory .,sport
it is trying to fit two puzzle piece together that do not quite match .,sport
yeah it is a great analogy .,sport
yeah they are both important piece .,sport
the finding a way for them to coexist is the challenge .,sport
it highlight the complexity of the situation .,sport
there no easy answer .,sport
and both side have valid point .,sport
but let dig a little deeper into the un argument here .,sport
they are not saying that france can not have any limit on religious expression at all .,sport
what they are saying is that any restriction have to be demonstrably necessary and proportionate .,sport
it is saying you can have a rule but it need to be directly related to a specific problem .,sport
and it can not be overly harsh .,sport
in this case the un is essentially asking france to show me the evidence that allowing woman to wear hijab in sport cause harm or undermines the principle of secularism .,sport
exactly. . and they are raising a important point here .,sport
what if this ban is based more on assumption about the hijab rather than any real demonstrable harm ?,sport
thats a good question .,sport
it seems we are getting to the core of this whole debate .,sport
it is not about a piece of clothing .,sport
it is about how we define and uphold individual right within a society that also ha collective value .,sport
you are hitting the nail on the head .,sport
and this is where thing get even more interesting. . because the un is not focused on the hijab ban itself .,sport
they are also concerned about the wider context of intolerance and stigmatization towards hijab wearing woman and girl in france .,sport
wait they are suggesting that this ban might be a symptom of a bigger problem ?,sport
they are indeed .,sport
and thats something well explore further a we continue this deep dive .,sport
this is already giving me a lot to think about .,sport
what stand out to you the most far ?,sport
whats fascinating to me is how this case in france throw a spotlight on this tension between individual right and collective value .,sport
it is a tension that exists in every society .,sport
and finding that balance is never easy .,sport
and i am curious to see how the french government responds to all of this pressure from the un especially with the paris two thousand and twenty four olympics on the horizon .,sport
thats a great point .,sport
the timing of this debate add another layer of complexity .,sport
itll be interesting to see how this all play out .,sport
all let take a moment to absorb all of this .,sport
before we continue our deep dive there still a lot to unpack here .,sport
and i have a feeling this is only going to get more interesting .,sport
weve established that the un is questioning france justification for this hijab ban in sport .,sport
they are urging them to prove that it is absolutely necessary and proportionate .,sport
yeah you got it .,sport
and whats interesting is that the un is not stopping there .,sport
they are calling out france for this wider pattern of intolerance towards hijab wearing woman and girl .,sport
yeah the article mention that they are urging france to actively protect these individual and promote genuine equality and respect for cultural diversity .,sport
it almost sound they are saying hey you need to check yourselves and make sure that this ban is not part of a bigger problem .,sport
they are suggesting that this ban might be a symptom of some deeply rooted prejudice .,sport
remember that hypothetical we talked about earlier the young muslim girl feeling pressured to wear the hijab even if she doesnt personally want to ?,sport
the un is saying that france need to make sure they are addressing the root cause of that pressure rather than focusing on the outward symbol .,sport
thats such an important point .,sport
it is treating a symptom without addressing the underlying illness .,sport
how is france responding to all of this ?,sport
the article did not go into that .,sport
thats because the situation is still unfolding. . but i can tell you this is not the first time that france ha faced criticism over it secularism loss. . especially when it come to the hijab. ?,sport
in fact there a whole history there .,sport
i did not realize this had been going on for long .,sport
can you give u a bit of that historical context ?,sport
france ha this very specific and somewhat unique approach to secularism which they call laicite .,sport
and it go beyond separating church and state. . it is about ensuring that religion is kept entirely out of the public sphere .,sport
no religious symbol no religious holiday celebrated in public school that thing .,sport
exactly. . and this concept of laicite ha been a cornerstone of french identity for over a century .,sport
it stem from their history of religious war and the struggle to establish a republic free from the influence of the catholic church. . for many french people laicite is seen a essential for ensuring equality and preventing religious conflict .,sport
i am starting to understand why this debate is sensitive for them .,sport
but even with that historical context it is hard to ignore the fact that this ban specifically target muslim woman and girls. . how do they reconcile that with their claim of neutrality ?,sport
thats the million dollar question .,sport
france argues that the hijab is more than a religious symbol .,sport
they see it a a political statement even a potential tool for oppression. . they point to case in some part of the world where woman are forced to wear the hijab against their will. . i can see how that would raise concern .,sport
but is not that generalizing an entire group of people based on the action of a few ? .,sport
surely not all muslim woman who wear the hijab are being forced to do .,sport
thats precisely the argument that the un is making. . they are saying that france need to be careful not to conflate the action of extremist with the belief and practice of everyday muslim .,sport
they are pushing france to provide concrete evidence that the hijab itself pose a specific threat to public order. . or to the right of others .,sport
it boil down to whether the french government can justify this ban with concrete evidence .,sport
or if this is more about their interpretation of the hijab and it potential impact on french society .,sport
and thats where this debate get tricky .,sport
because how do you measure something the potential for social disruption ?,sport
what evidence would be convincing enough for both side ?,sport
thats a great question .,sport
and it is something we need to keep in mind a we continue this deep dive. . it is clear that we are dealing with this complex web of historical political and social factor .,sport
and there are no easy answer .,sport
but i think we are getting a much clearer picture of why this debate is contentious and why it matter much not to france but to the world .,sport
you are spot on .,sport
this case highlight the challenge that many country face when they are trying to balance individual freedom with societal values. . it is a conversation thats happening in different form all over the globe .,sport
and a we delve further into this it is becoming increasingly clear that this is not about a piece of clothing .,sport
it is about how we define religious freedom how we address cultural difference and ultimately what society we want to live in .,sport
and with the paris two thousand and twenty four olympics around the corner the world is watching to see how france will navigate these complex issue .,sport
what message will they send to their own citizen and to the global community ?,sport
i do not know about you but i am definitely hooked on this story now .,sport
me too .,sport
it is got history politics social justice international relation .,sport
it is a real life political thriller unfolding before our eye .,sport
and it is a reminder that these issue are not headline .,sport
they have real world consequence for real people .,sport
let take a moment to let all of that sink in before we move on to the final part of our deep dive. . i have a feeling there even more to unpack here .,sport
we are back and ready to wrap up our deep dive on this hijab ban in france .,sport
yeah it is been a fascinating conversation .,sport
it is amazing how something seemingly simple a piece of clothing can spark such a complex global debate .,sport
it highlight how interconnected we all are .,sport
what happens in france especially with the olympics coming up .,sport
resonates far beyond their border .,sport
speaking of the olympics the article did not get into that too much .,sport
but it is hard not to think about how all of this will play out on that global stage .,sport
imagine a muslim athlete being told she can not represent her country because of her hijab .,sport
itd be a powerful image for sure .,sport
and it would force the world to confront this tension between france commitment to lécité and the principle of inclusivity that the olympics are supposed to represent .,sport
it is such a tough situation .,sport
on one hand you have france a nation thats deeply proud of it history and it value trying to uphold what they see a absolutely essential for social harmony .,sport
and then on the other hand you have this global event thats supposed to be about celebrating diversity and bringing people together .,sport
it is almost a microcosm of the challenge facing the world today .,sport
how do we navigate these increasingly diverse society while still respecting individual belief and identity ? .,sport
and where do we draw the line when it come to regulating personal expression in the name of this collective good ?,sport
it is not easy .,sport
and i think this deep dive ha shown u there no simple answer here .,sport
definitely not .,sport
but what strike me is that both side in this debate genuinely believe they are fighting for something important .,sport
france see lécité a the cornerstone of their republic a safeguard against division and conflict .,sport
and the un is equally passionate about protecting individual freedom and ensuring that everyone ha an equal chance to participate in society .,sport
thats what make this compelling .,sport
it is not a case of good versus evil or versus wrong .,sport
it is about two set of deeply held value that are coming into conflict .,sport
and finding a way forward requires understanding empathy and a willingness to engage in some thoughtful dialogue .,sport
what i am wondering is listening to all of this if maybe the way we frame this debate is part of the problem we keep talking about it a this clash between secularism and religious freedom .,sport
but maybe it is more nuanced than that .,sport
yeah thats a good point .,sport
perhaps it is le about these opposing force and more about finding a way for different principle to coexist instead of focusing on what divide u . maybe we should be looking for that common ground .,sport
i think youve hit on something important .,sport
it is not about one side winning and the other side losing .,sport
it is about finding a way to live together that honor both individual right and those collective value .,sport
and that requires compromise understanding and a willingness to see thing from different perspective .,sport
this deep dive ha given me a lot to think about .,sport
and i am sure our listener feel the same way .,sport
whats the key takeaway that you would want to leave them with a we start to wrap up ?,sport
i think the most important thing is to remember this is not a story thats happening over there in france .,sport
this is a reflection of challenge that we all face a we try to build these inclusive and society in an increasingly diverse world .,sport
it is a reminder that the answer are very rarely simple or easy .,sport
and it take that ongoing dialogue a willingness to listen to those different perspective and a commitment to finding that common ground .,sport
this ha been an incredible deep dive .,sport
and i hope our listener feel equipped to continue exploring this topic on their own .,sport
the conversation far from over .,sport
and i have a feeling well be revisiting this issue again in the future. . the world is watching and the stake are high .,sport
they are .,sport
thanks for joining u for this deep dive everyone .,sport
thanks for listening .,sport
until next time keep questioning keep learning and keep striving for a better world .,sport
is absolutely free .,sport
hello everyone and welcome back into the gsmc fantasy sport podcast .,sport
we are now on our third segment of the day here .,sport
i am going to take a little respite from the world of the nfl for a little bit and talk about the world of college football a always .,sport
we talk about nfl fantasy star .,sport
he not a effective a a passer a we want out of a dual threat qb and weve seen it throughout the season .,sport
weve seen him put together very solid rushing performance but havent necessarily seen him pas the football a effectively a you would for someone of his caliber and for someone playing that program .,sport
but against navy at metlife it all came together .,sport
and they are still very much in the discussion .,sport
remember a an independent it might be tougher for them to truly prove to the committee without being in a conference their strength .,sport
and they needed this win against a ranked navy side who for all intent and purpose wa looking they could have upset notre dame with their style of play but ultimately came up very disgustingly short .,sport
navy could not necessarily get anything going .,sport
and notre dame roll on and if you want to see riley leonard succeed this wa the performance that showed that he can succeed in both manner .,sport
the air into the ground and it is a very important one because they face another military academy looking to knock them down a peg in the army .,sport
this performance is truly paramount to the success of riley leonard and it is notre dame team a . congratulation to riley leonard for making this list for the first time .,sport
the running back position this is a guy who going to turn a lot of head in the playoff race especially in the acc thats getting that much more congested a week go on .,sport
how about the shard smith of the smu mustang .,sport
twenty six carry one hundred and seventy seven yard two touchdown twenty seven.four fantasy point .,sport
week before a big game against pitt that prof what those school would be an acc contender .,sport
not for nothing i feel smu is one of those team who relies on the explosiveness they have on the off and the side of the football .,sport
they are going to win game by beating you by scoring a many point a possible before can even blink your eye .,sport
i feel if smu doe not look prepared for that game then they are challenging .,sport
but for the time being i feel smu is going to be a team ready for anything here in the acc down the stretch .,sport
but it is going to be dependent on guy for shard smith to step up because a much a i love kevin jennings there might be a time where his dualfight ability to get exposed and pitt could be that team .,sport
you need that balance on your offense if you are smu but for the time being where shard smith is definitely deserving of a place on my list .,sport
at the wide receiver position it is a little bit tough to parse through these wide receiver performance .,sport
no one stood out but i feel this guy is making his second appearance on my list is one of those guy who you wouldnt have expected starting the year to have a much of an impact a people think .,sport
but a someone who ha been all too familiar with him this season and all too familiar to what he brings to the plate for texas a a texas longhorn spain i think we are starting to see the growth maturity of this young man in the andre moore .,sport
i feel he one of the younger player in that wide receiver core .,sport
he is going to be someone who for many year here at the program would be someone who potentially ha much more room for growth because of the fact no one expected him to break out this early in his career here .,sport
but this game a very rough game for texas where they needed every bit of their offense production fiber reception ninety seven yard two touchdown for a total of twenty four.seven fantasy point for the andre moore .,sport
you are going to need versatility in your offense .,sport
thats the name of the game for texas and what thats what their cradle is that they live by .,sport
look for the andre moore potentially a the season grows on get more and more look at the yrc position .,sport
most importantly have the translate over into many more year of the archimanding era of success for him and this team because i feel this season for texas ha proved to be a wake up call a little bit in their first two real big sec test .,sport
at home to georgia they got knocked down a peg .,sport
on the road to vanderbilt it is now becoming a very tough team to play against at home and not necessarily a pushover anymore here on the sec .,sport
i feel texas is starting to realize what it need to truly compete year in year out in the sec and the andre moore could be an x factor to their success in this conference for many year .,sport
but these are two guy who on national title contending team could prove to be vital integral to their team success .,sport
without further ado let talk about damien martinez and then discus bo pribula .,sport
if there are any game coming up where cam ward ha a slow start is not a effective a you would him to be or your receiver core is a little bit unsettled and look for damien martinez to be a breakthrough star down the stretch of miami .,sport
i feel i do not want to get ahead of myself talking about this game but seeing the hype or that campus expect beaver stadium to be very packed that weekend expect what happens in this one for penn state to stick with this team .,sport
come on down and join u friend we got fun football trivia plus bridge is giving away a gorgeous fifty fiveinch highdeaf bear vision television along with unbelievable drink special and the coldest and most refreshing game beer in chicago land thanks for joining u friend .,sport

if he wa that good hed be a starter what ?,sport
magic i do not think ive ever seen anyone that high completion percentage a a rookie but i think it is your smart pas and smart pas yeah yeah i agree .,sport
weve seen caleb evolve from a shaky rookie two month ago against tennessee in a poise game changer who wa thrown for seven score against one interception over the last three game where ha he improved the most since his first two nfl game ?,sport
this is montez sweat revenge game .,sport
this is huge all over man and i will say this i think that that is big for him .,sport
i think thats big for him to to come in and then ride high .,sport
weve had three win .,sport
i look for a fourth one man .,sport
i think thats thats very important yeah here a deal .,sport
here a deal .,sport
it is a duel and he doing against daniel .,sport
what statement are you looking for from caleb to make today ?,sport
what what do him doing ?,sport
thats all it matter baby win baby yep for sure man .,sport
yeah what they are trying to do is what the team did to caleb in the first couple game which wa put a lot of try to come with a lot of pressure yeah i think i think there going to be a lot of a lot of pressure .,sport
hey jimmy league .,sport
thanks for showing up man thanks for helping u out back there now i i couldnt agree more man who will be the xfactor on the bear defense to containing the league top scorn offense between the defense of land and the linebacker but i think youll accept .,sport
there going to be edward and edmonds .,sport
i am going to give it to to contain the run if they have no plan edward and edmonds .,sport
yes edward and edmonds .,sport
yeah i could believe how quick we think well be the x factor receiver for williams today do you think that dj moore is going to go off and get three touchdown and two hundred and thirty plus yard ?,sport
hell show up and show out and he also a type of guy thats going to make other player better around him and thats what you need in aroma dunce and i think he even helping dj more out iron sharpens iron or you get exposed absolutely for sure .,sport
i i think that to today it is it is funny and i talked about this on a few show i talked about it friday with brian earl ocher when he wa on the chicago sport podcast show thats pinch yourself .,sport

i am here for all of that .,sport
and i know him basketball .,sport
football they say he an animal .,sport
since you talk about basketball let start there .,sport
let start with basketball because there wa a moment what i am saying ?,sport
shes talking about prep .,sport
he asked who won championship .,sport
there wa a moment in the nba what i am saying ?,sport
that wa her round of world not her but scene round of world .,sport
it wa something that wa led up to a lot of medium behind .,sport
and i want to know if you got if it got you to the point where it wa supposed to get you to did you had the warm and fuzzies ?,sport
why would it give me the warm and fuzzies ?,sport
listen people say it wa a monument .,sport
first time of a father against the play on the court with his son .,sport
no listen thats dope .,sport
you can not take that away from anything that .,sport
regardless of how we feel about king james and bronnick should be there whatever the case may be we are talking about a dad playing with his kid at the biggest stage of a professional sport event for that sport .,sport
you can not get nobody that .,sport
it felt it wa they were doing it he cut me history .,sport
we all know that .,sport
but at the end of the day is it still thorough ?,sport
yes all that .,sport
it would be a hell of a moment for if i am the dad it would be hell of a moment for me .,sport
but outside of that i do not think people care .,sport
no the people care .,sport
they do .,sport
they care .,sport
they do not care .,sport
but people a lot of people care .,sport
the medium care .,sport
it felt it is manufactured .,sport
you played the play .,sport
it wa manufactured for him to go .,sport
but thats what i am saying .,sport
thats why it missed the mark for me .,sport
people keep it all the way through .,sport
it wa when mr. mark for you regardless .,sport
there wasnt too much that could happen .,sport
when he got drafted it did not matter .,sport
yeah that wa what it wa for .,sport
it felt manufactured .,sport
he made the nba and they played together .,sport
i wa thats double shit .,sport
you think i hate lebron but thats not a hypothetical .,sport
lebron would have been leaving all of this behind between me and me .,sport
if he wa good he would have been the same tall friend .,sport
yeah but he not good .,sport
he can play basketball .,sport
he not a nba player now .,sport
no he not .,sport
when nobody say he not an nba player he got nba prospect .,sport
he not .,sport
he a good basketball player .,sport
could be nba nba player eventually .,sport
yeah he also got work on the body .,sport
what six three ?,sport
yeah if that and he got a true point guard .,sport
i am saying it is i do not know if he would have been a doper moment .,sport
he can play defense .,sport
yeah but at least he got skill .,sport
he got something with skill set .,sport
he not a defender a lot of them defender .,sport
no he not .,sport
he too small .,sport
he could become one .,sport
he should be in the g league .,sport
it is great in both now .,sport
yeah i do not care because it is not it is not my team .,sport
all that warm and fuzzy it is not it is not there for me ?,sport
if this wa allen iverson and his son that may be a little different for me because iverson played on my team .,sport
thats my guy .,sport
whatever but it is dope .,sport
shout out to them man .,sport
if it wasnt manufactured if it wa more natural he deserved to get drafted .,sport
and would that have done anything more for you to still feel the same regarding it ?,sport
i do not think there nothing i do not think there anything that could have made the the the the the brown and brown join force .,sport
yeah i do not think there anything it is what it is .,sport
it is a cool little moment .,sport
shout out to them .,sport
they got to do some stuff that never had been done before on the nba level .,sport
they got to have a moment a a father son and then cool .,sport
not a season going what ?,sport
yeah hell pop up on the team from time to time .,sport
they said the yemo they said the boy connect there .,sport
but a much a cat get hurt ?,sport
and brownie is a big enough name that he going to get him caught .,sport
hell get a call up if the injury happen at least once during the league .,sport
at least once .,sport
i refuse to believe whether he deserves to play is another thing .,sport
i agree with you .,sport
i think he at least get whats his name ?,sport
i thought you were going to say something else .,sport
you were saying that you were going to go to the ranch .,sport
how we feel about this nba season man ?,sport

yanis is only down here .,sport
sometimes being if you do something what i am saying ?,sport
yeah but guess what ?,sport
you are one trick pony .,sport

i am not saying he a he a he he more versatile .,sport
i am saying when he want to do the one thing that he doe he doe it probably especially in playoff .,sport
to this point he done it better than joe than than ambitis .,sport
hell do better than hell do better than than than bull .,sport
i wanted to talk about injury real quick .,sport
she had a part i do not i do not care about money .,sport
she had a part she had a part .,sport
that that that what did that come on ?,sport
the mics hot .,sport
yeah not not not with d. george washington and his cart cart cart .,sport
i am not even a little bit of slander. . that wasnt disrespectful. . hey all let talk .,sport
what you want to talk about ?,sport
she did a podcast when she talked about her .,sport
he came prepared .,sport
he came prepared .,sport
he want you to get what you i am going to pull a driveline .,sport
what you are not going to do is you are not you are not going to speak for me when i am when i am trying to help you out because clearly you want to get to where you want to go .,sport
i do want to talk about no do do the .,sport
do get out the way .,sport
what we say about it .,sport
she did a podcast when she talked about her mba salary and how much she make it .,sport
how much she make versus how much she spends .,sport
she say shes living outside of mean .,sport
her salary is seventyzero .,sport
eight thousand .,sport
no but eightyzero a year .,sport
no but eightyzero .,sport
no but eightyzero .,sport
no but eightyzero .,sport
no but eightyzero .,sport
no but eightyzero a year .,sport
no eight thousand a month .,sport
eight thousand a month .,sport
thats over here .,sport
wish our thought on that type of logic from a. from a sport star .,sport
the thing is the thing is when you talk about her she looking at her she do not know her finance .,sport
shes young .,sport
shes probably do not .,sport
she probably got somebody else .,sport
she probably got somebody else working on her finance ?,sport
but she wa asking .,sport
she did not even know that .,sport
she did not even know what wa going on .,sport
she did not know her money .,sport
she wa saying this .,sport
she did not know anything .,sport
what i am saying is shes looking at her wma contract .,sport
thats first .,sport
that she only made seventyzero apartment .,sport
eight thousand .,sport
but guess what ?,sport
her endorsement and anything else cover that .,sport
she did not look at individual stream of income. . shes looking at .,sport
i can afford this stuff .,sport
let me let me phrase it this. . let say this wa your daughter. . and they are going strictly off of what she said in the interview. . i am going to get a rebog or because strictly what she said in the interview .,sport
we do not know the logistics of it .,sport
she got all those contracts. . and shes being in front of the fact that shes living outside of mean .,sport
what would you say to her ?,sport
but shes not living outside of mean .,sport
shes living outside .,sport
the thing is shes living out of her mean if she only had that one stream of income .,sport
thats the thing is the thing is the issue is and thats how i said she did not know what it wa because she got other multiple stream of income .,sport
but technically shes not living out of her mean because she got the endorsement .,sport
she got that now that that shoe deal she got paper .,sport
but if it wa if it wa if she wa only if she wa a regular wma player ?,sport
guess what ?,sport
she wouldnt be having that eightzero apartment whatever it is .,sport
i can guarantee that .,sport
she probably wouldnt even even even close .,sport
she probably wouldnt even be trying to have an eightzero contract because one thing that i am saying male or female one thing that come along with when you go to the wma .,sport
you are a male or female one thing that come along with when you become a high profile athlete is that you got to live a certain way .,sport
you got to get the perception that you live a certain way .,sport
you need a certain little security too .,sport
i think i get what don wa saying .,sport
i know the other guy .,sport
i did not say that .,sport
i said i do not know what i know what i know .,sport
i did not say that .,sport
i did not say that .,sport
i did not understand don what ?,sport
it is three night of louse and then have to tell you what to call for it .,sport
who third ?,sport
yeah who third ?,sport
he not louse .,sport
he is not part of the deluge .,sport
he not louse .,sport
yall aint standing that far apart from each other .,sport
when we do the skin complex we are not going to get into the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the skin complex .,sport
we not going to get into that .,sport
i am not going to do this .,sport
no i am saying yeah to chris point shes without without hearing the whole without hearing the whole full context of everything she wa saying going off of the thing ive heard and read .,sport
shes not saying that shes broke .,sport
shes shes what i what i think shes doing i think shes highlighting at the time because i am pretty sure i am pretty sure there a collective bargaining grating and grating .,sport
i am pretty sure there a collective bargaining grating and grating .,sport
i am pretty sure there a collective bargaining grating and grating .,sport
i am pretty sure there a collective bargaining agreement or some contract or something that ha to be .,sport
it is not but thats a there something that or there i am sorry they are trying to they are trying to force a renegotiation .,sport
yeah. . of their of their salary .,sport
mind you the wnba reported that this season wa the first one .,sport
they lost forty million .,sport
but they they want to update contract .,sport
the buying up the the bill thats dropped after the first month of spring .,sport
but the어 cl of people in the snow the the the deuxième bookium lunchsafe that wa the out to the ω and the beach they gon care what ?,sport

that wa about to go on .,sport
ask what nfl .,sport
what we doing ?,sport
natted youve identified some thing that youve identified a or wrong .,sport
do you think the trend continue though ?,sport
now how doe it go from this point ?,sport
i still think it is not a way to halfway point .,sport
the choice seem to be .,sport
not a way to halfway point .,sport
give me three more prediction .,sport
now that youve seen half a football three more prediction you can base it on what youve seen thus far .,sport
whats that ?,sport

i predict that the red the commander continue going throughout the season .,sport
cowboy continue to diminish .,sport
i predict the .,sport
can they hear you ?,sport
it is a little he wa talking to the air .,sport
we probably look crazy now if they can not hear you .,sport
you want to see the speed .,sport
whats the third one ?,sport
you want to see the cowboy do ?,sport
you said that one already .,sport
you gave u two .,sport
they were looking for you to give a third one .,sport
you did not give it to me .,sport
he did not say that .,sport
he said it wa top three .,sport
yeah he said give u your third one .,sport
do not stop trying to check me .,sport
bro you be low key condis .,sport
i said stop worrying about whats coming out .,sport
thats what you talk about .,sport
all type of wildness .,sport
i am going to give my three prediction because i do not want any of this smoke .,sport
because you are talking about it now .,sport
i think yall coach get fired .,sport
i think .,sport
wait wait when fire win .,sport
you think end season ?,sport
not now but i think in the latter couple game of the season when it is clearly .,sport
once that x or whatever it is the astros for elimination or whatever i think that i think baker may feel continues to be whatever the fuck this is that we are watching now .,sport
and i think tampa bay win the division .,sport
thats in three way .,sport
my trippin and my mrs. atlanta .,sport
and they are not soft .,sport
their record should be .,sport
atlanta five and three and whats four .,sport
four and four .,sport
it could be. . but i think baker continues to excel .,sport
and i think what you are going to play i am not saying he nice that but i think the patriot got themselves .,sport
they have something of something that they have to at least continue to evaluate .,sport
and i think that they i think that they will win more game than they probably want to win .,sport
the not being at top two or three to even though they do not need a quarterback to have the ability to trade that pick god forbid you get one .,sport
then you got everyone trying to get shador or whoever is the number one quarterback .,sport
and i think i think minnesota come .,sport
i think they fall fall off a little bit .,sport
i not not for a whole season .,sport
i am going to go with i think detroit is the team to beat nfc .,sport
full compliment team office and defense .,sport
brings to the anchor that defense which i think the eagle messed up because they should have picked them over known smith but whatever .,sport
and then their office is dynamic passing office of line running they got the best office in nfl now .,sport
i think on the opposite side no keep it in the north nfc north i think three team in the north will make the playoff .,sport
and the thing is it could be it could be all four but i guarantee they got a picture .,sport
it is going to be three for the beard .,sport
i think the beard is is there a beard is a hard out .,sport
now they started you play the bear out of easy out defensively .,sport
they got a great defense and then young boy caleb in that office he got weapon .,sport
it is not a hard out .,sport
that and i do believe that if this is what game three or four the nichols out .,sport
this is three coming up .,sport
three coming up .,sport
i believe that no i am sorry this is thursday it is not one more .,sport
four year .,sport
next wa the week before .,sport
i believe that houston texas when nicole collins come back probably the best team in the afc .,sport
kansa city is playing but they are barely winning .,sport
i think i think houston is going to be the best team in the afc once nichols once nichols come back .,sport
both predictions. . ill go i think josh out of win mvp .,sport
i thought that wa a little i thought it wa a little bit of a time thing .,sport
i think i agree with jerry from minnesota falling back down the earth .,sport
i think ill go nfc .,sport
i would say i got i think i think baltimore unceased kansa city .,sport
if i go who the best team in the afc if i go i would probably baltimore .,sport
i think i think he might deserve it .,sport
i do not think they are going to give him another one .,sport
i think it is it is one of those thing where it is fatigue what i am saying ?,sport
and i think they are going to look at here what i think a lot of josh what buffalo six and two ?,sport
i think they are going to look at josh out in season and say he did it with nobody .,sport
if they keep it up they are going to win the division .,sport
the division terrible now .,sport
they are going to win the division .,sport
all my three i think the division is two of his last season in the nfl .,sport
i think this is it .,sport
bull prediction .,sport
yeah thats the ball .,sport
i think this is yeah i think i think yeah i think he done .,sport
thats going to change our name in miami .,sport
i think that i think that if cincinnati loses i am going to say two more game i do not think jamar stay in cincinnati .,sport
he hasnt gotten his contract yet .,sport
that wa already an issue .,sport
and if they continue to lose this i do not see why he would want to stay .,sport
ill be curious to see what that look .,sport
and then number three slowly but surely on the low bronco sneaking to the playoff on the low .,sport
nobody paying attention to them .,sport
no one paying attention to them but on the low they they they moving .,sport
i can see that happening and sneak in there .,sport
yeah thats a good thats a good i got one more .,sport
we all go with me .,sport
everybody got one more now .,sport
there you go .,sport
i think that i think the cheese is going to it is going to be ugly .,sport
i think they are going to flirt with a long undefeated type type season .,sport
i could see them being fourteen fifteen and old type shit .,sport
and resting piece to my man mercury morris but i wouldnt be shocked if i am one of them dude that i storyline and shit .,sport
i wouldnt be shocked if the year that he after he pass that that wouldnt be the first year that we see someone go undefeated .,sport
and the only game that i if i am looking at this the only game that looked crazy for them wa it wa ant buffalo .,sport
ant buffalo versus houston and the atkinson .,sport
i am saying now those three i do not think my one more ?,sport
those aint this those aint this .,sport
whats up ?,sport
i think i think we about to be saying i am not we are we are .,sport
i think we bought the resurgence of let rus cook .,sport
it is about to be here .,sport
do not let ryan you say it for real .,sport
doe that mean that you put that a the piss the piss what they i think i think pittsburgh will win the division .,sport
you did what it wa ten and seven ?,sport
no i got them they probably gon na go twelve .,sport
listen here one thing one thing for certain two thing for sure .,sport
we can we can disagree about a lot of thing .,sport
i hope you all disagree with this .,sport
j.j. watt t.j. watt is hand down the best defensive player in the nfl ?,sport
i am saying the best defensive player in the nfl .,sport
i think he the best but if someone argued me mile ago i wouldnt do too much .,sport
i agree with you .,sport
but i t.j. watt he ha a knack for making clothes out please i do not know .,sport
he both he playing here .,sport
he playing here .,sport
but yeah i think rus will we bought the we bought the here starting here in the name again a little bit .,sport

thats what we must say .,sport
that wa my one more .,sport
yeah my one more is that i do not see i do not think san francisco will win the nfc west .,sport

the ram ?,sport
if san francisco you hurt i can see it but .,sport
i am gon na say i do not see you got they all they all four and four .,sport
yeah but san francisco is hurt .,sport
nobody else is everybodys outside the chief .,sport
no one playing more football than san francisco in the last four year .,sport
and i think we are seeing it .,sport
thats thats thats thats i think .,sport
i do not always read that .,sport
no i think i think i think i think me personally i think that arizona is gon na take a step .,sport
now i do not think nobody reckons it is gon na be high .,sport
i think arizona will out out .,sport

cause the north is going to they may have three team in it .,sport
i wa with it until i did .,sport
thats my thats my thats my bold prediction .,sport

i am correcting you because i did not say dak wa a number two .,sport
i said that it is funny how yall think dak is not even in the top five when he comparable to josh island .,sport

and my man said you are reaching you are reaching .,sport

but i am gon na be accurate with it .,sport
i said josh island and dak were comparable .,sport
this wa leading up to that .,sport
i am not i am be realistic at the end of the day .,sport
he playing trash .,sport
is that press got a top five course ?,sport
you get a foot down twice the same foot ten .,sport
no it is got to be two foot no .,sport
twice that he can score a touchdown with good .,sport
unless it count a football move .,sport
you get one foot in twice ?,sport
if you can do it a a if it is one foot if it is called if they say it is a football move then they count it .,sport
he got a touchdown .,sport
thats not a football move .,sport
you can make a football move .,sport
he got two touchdown but do not have no touchdown .,sport
he aint saying it can be passed yeah .,sport
he got two touchdown but do not touch the ground .,sport
he gon na go for a better .,sport
see you must have the whole job .,sport
let talk about it .,sport
everyone stopped and watched the george .,sport
they couldnt make it .,sport
don none of yall clearly want to .,sport
do not make me not argue about it .,sport
i do not want to argue about it .,sport
there no argument to be had .,sport
whats your way of arguing ?,sport
yall should talk .,sport
i do not know yall play .,sport
you should get your shit off .,sport
it is confident when the eagle win a game .,sport
i am supposed to not be confident .,sport
who that ?,sport
who saying it wa a shit ?,sport
yeah i am confused .,sport
you are not supposed to be confident .,sport
hold up .,sport
we got five .,sport
which yall got ?,sport
i get you not qualified to talk about this .,sport
which yall got two win ?,sport
see here the thing jerv .,sport
when we lose i do not mind coming to a podcast and talking about it and owning it .,sport
when yall lose yall even show up to the freaking podcast .,sport
then it disappear when yall have a bad game .,sport
then there only when the game let say it wa a monday night game .,sport
would you be here if the eagle come in late ?,sport
can i ask you this ?,sport
can you answer my question first ?,sport
i am about to answer your question good brother .,sport
i am gon na answer your question .,sport
can i answer it now ?,sport
you lowheight .,sport
because you look you are not your height .,sport
every monday i ask don is this the monday chris is gon na be at the podcast or not ?,sport
if don say only reason i showed up the day because i did not think chris wa gon na be here because chris week would have been last week .,sport
yeah would be .,sport
but there wa no show .,sport
only reason i definitely showed wa because ryan said he wa not gon na be here .,sport
however no matter what happens this weekend let me tell you again i told you two week ago when you said this same shit when you said the same shit let me tell you i will not be here next monday .,sport
however i will be here the following monday .,sport
here the thing .,sport
he will not .,sport
thats my point .,sport
well play .,sport
well play .,sport
we to watch it .,sport
i do not watch game with the eagle fan .,sport
i am damn sure not about to watch game with people that do not want my team to win .,sport
i do not even watch it with people that want my team to win .,sport
hey some people are very insecure .,sport
no some people to be by themselves and watch forty of it .,sport
it is safer that way .,sport
i am saying we do not come to the eagle play .,sport
because we to watch .,sport
i want to know that .,sport
i am getting a little bit of that eagle fan are confident now .,sport
this is going to be a little bit of a run .,sport
you want to hold the hope. . no no no .,sport
ask me about the eagle .,sport
ask me about the eagle .,sport
here you go .,sport
i have a realistic eagle conversation with you real quick .,sport
i said when aj brand you wa in here i got you .,sport
do not cut his shirt .,sport
because i heard you say nigga we about to lose .,sport
hold on .,sport
now ive given my weekly prediction however many time it is a separate one week .,sport
i probably have picked the eagle lose at least three times. ?,sport
there no homerism there sir .,sport
now what ill say is that if you ask me about my squad i think the defense is playing better .,sport
they are not playing a an elite defense but they are not playing a a bottom feeder .,sport
they are middle of the pack .,sport
and thats cool for now .,sport
i the improvement .,sport
i how nicoby dean is getting better .,sport
and i think that with my man darius slay being injured every other play .,sport
and then what i wa putting koop is .,sport
thats not who i am .,sport
thats not who i am talking about .,sport
i am trying to say cooper being put in the slot .,sport
thats what i wa trying to say .,sport
cooper being in the slot ha helped out the defense. ?,sport
and i think that jaylin hertz now is playing better football .,sport
they are still .,sport
we have offensive line issues. ?,sport
we have a coach issue still because he a buffoon and special team .,sport
and it is cool .,sport
but bottom line is i am not sitting up acting we .,sport
my man said the lion are the best team in football .,sport
we did not say that the eagle no one had .,sport
keeping it being until you brought .,sport
no thats what he said .,sport
until this until you brought up the eagle now and said i see this .,sport
but i am showing you the difference .,sport
if this wa two year ago but if this wa two year ago youd have been hearing equal shit all season .,sport
i am not saying you are not confident .,sport
there still hole in the team .,sport
i am saying listen we are a weak what ?,sport
and normally it is a weak but this is the first week where i heard our chest is pumped .,sport
that sound a good team .,sport
thats not my argument .,sport
i am saying this is the first week .,sport
you are asking if we are confident .,sport
i would say that i feel healthy .,sport
i feel if our roster go up against any roster in the nfl if they are healthy i feel we have a chance to beat anyone .,sport
and it is not two year ago where i felt whoever the fuck it wa it did not matter .,sport
we were beating them .,sport
but i think now there not too many team where i am damn we play them .,sport
we can not beat them .,sport
i think we have a chance .,sport
there no team thats scared .,sport
they scare me .,sport
however i am one of them people that go it is detroit ?,sport
the fucking ball bounce supposed to bounce out of bound but somehow somewhere when it come and it blow the ball back in bound and it stay in bound against the scuba score for touchdown or something. ?,sport
shit happens .,sport
i think we could be detroit but if i am not shocked that when we play detroit if we were to play detroit the detroit the favorite .,sport
and again i would fully expect detroit to go in a the favorite .,sport
fully healthy fully healthy .,sport
fully healthy .,sport
i our team to say anybody fully fully healthy .,sport
i do not think i do not think there not a corner in the nfl that can fuck with aj brown .,sport
and that not even trying to talk shit .,sport
i do not think there a corner in the nfl that can fuck with aj brown .,sport
and i how the young bull quinn quinn mitchell is is playing .,sport
quinn mitchell is playing better .,sport
he playing against number one receiver .,sport
i am excited about that shit .,sport
there no there no gimmick .,sport
there no there no he happens to pick off pass because no he doesnt get kept for shit .,sport
can not get for shit but you are not going to get shit .,sport
he he go it is going to be in completion .,sport
you prefer wedding because he not going to pick it off .,sport
it is going to be in completion .,sport
but i our chance against majority of the team in the nfl .,sport
and i think we have an opportunity to be one of the four team remaining .,sport
and once you do that anythings possible .,sport
we doing this .,sport
is it my other team ?,sport
can you take it ?,sport
on the eagle .,sport
whatever you want whatever you want to talk whatever your little hard desire daryl .,sport
honestly i honestly knew i wa going to win .,sport
i have a question for yall though a eagle fan .,sport
not coach but coordinator .,sport
you say even if your team is fully healthy are you confident in your office or coordinator the way ?,sport
thats because i know you .,sport
i know you are coordinated .,sport
thats why i am asking you .,sport
when it come down to it i believe that also now yall going to play off .,sport
yall in the playoff or now ?,sport
because the issue is both you have you have a good team .,sport
yall roster is crazy ?,sport
but your coordinator i your d quarter seems to have a to your point you are up and playing d better but your office is still your office .,sport
now jalen hurt had a good game but is that going to be consistent ?,sport
he probably one of the last couple game but i got you talking about one specific game .,sport
the issue is .,sport
listen these are my coordinator .,sport
the coordinator called some pretty good call .,sport
it is it is jalen seeing the field .,sport
thats thats my issue .,sport
it aint it aint a plate calling .,sport
it is the quarterback seeing the field at time .,sport
the issue is for me pound and ground and pound absolutely .,sport
they got to .,sport
i think we have to be i do not think anybody can fuck with it .,sport
i think itd be a run first offense and then pas the bat .,sport
and we are going to the honestly i heard a clip from seriani and he said and this wa after last week when she caught at one hundred and seventy six he wa saying we never lose our identity .,sport
that wa a good game but we are going to see how each game go .,sport
and we do not know if we are going to run the ball .,sport
every time we won last year is we ran the football .,sport
every time we lost one of the pas walking the nfl wanted to be a passing glorious through the ball around the field .,sport
thats me .,sport
we run the ball with the line that we have to shake off barkley with jalen hertz and then play action off of that and throw it to the receiver .,sport
thats what i see .,sport
and defensive play much better .,sport
and the reason why we play much better is because we are doing thing we havent done since jimmy johnson been in this blizzard .,sport
we are in blizzard till this year .,sport
yeah there you go .,sport
do i have concern about kellen moore ?,sport
yeah this is probably the most weapon he ever had .,sport
maybe this is the year he doe .,sport
maybe this is the year he doesnt fall short .,sport
and this is not a shot at you .,sport
but if kyle shanahan people can tell me that all the shit that ive seen every single year is not about to happen this year ?,sport
one year it is not going to happen .,sport
most likely one year .,sport
kyle shanahan will lead a team whether it is the niner or the next team whatever hell lead a team most likely to a championship. . why can not you man ?,sport
i know itll sting because not one of the eagle and they are also damn he can not do that shit for u . i do not think your head go with that .,sport
your head go with final and messed it up .,sport
i do not think our head .,sport
i think one thing weve seen in the last couple of week ever since the whole talking to the fan and all that shit .,sport
homie i do not think he doing too much to be honest with you .,sport
it is serious .,sport
i think yall have .,sport
when it come to that i think you have .,sport
i think anytime it is something bad you are going to blame sirianne anytime .,sport
it is not bad .,sport
the band if it is not it is not the word bad .,sport
it is anytime the offense look stale .,sport
it is .,sport
when they do something i get it .,sport
thats not it is not it is not even out of place .,sport
it is when they do the shit that that it is when they do the shit that doesnt make them look other nfl team which is little simple shit motion .,sport
you blame the guy .,sport
no i blame the guy that thats the consistent guy thats here .,sport
whenever the motion i am saying i think i think kelly moore ha been calling the police .,sport
i think everything that i do not know that is the most .,sport
and i think yall do not i do not think you let jalen check out of a lot of stuff too .,sport
that might be part of the problem too .,sport
i might be part of the problem too .,sport
i do not think that either .,sport
you do not think jalen is checking out ?,sport
i do not want to say he doe not check out because i am sure he doe .,sport
but i do not think it is at the rate that you are probably insinuating that he checking out .,sport
and the reason i can say that i can tell the difference between what appears to be a serianity called not maybe maybe a oneoff play note .,sport
ill say this .,sport
ill say this .,sport
i wa listening to the game .,sport
i wasnt watching .,sport
it wasnt much motion .,sport
it wasnt any .,sport
they throw it up to aj brown throw it up to the vincenzo. . it looked the same .,sport
but people will say thats more a opposed to saying it is the same shit .,sport
i agree with that .,sport
he a difference maker .,sport
i think i think i think and i think all fan to a certain extent have this notion. . when when the bad when the bad thing have you want to blame it on the person who you do not because it is easier .,sport
and when the good thing have you went he did that .,sport
it wa i give it when when when mike mcdaniels first went to miami ?,sport
and we would have a sale drop .,sport
no it is the same .,sport
they did not say my brother called the place .,sport
it is he happened .,sport
i think that for eagle and for the eagle in particular it is the first year he got here the office looked very still .,sport
it started to and then halfway through the second halfway through the first season he publicly give up play calling to my man is now in indianapolis .,sport
brian johnson not a brian .,sport
he give up play call .,sport
and then the following year the offense look completely different than anything weve seen out any other year .,sport
that one year look completely different ?,sport
and that wa the one year where we knew for a fact he wa not in charge of the place .,sport
then last year when you go back to it we took the play call because stike stike and left .,sport
last year they took the play call .,sport
brian johnson wa a court .,sport
hear me out .,sport
hear me out .,sport
what we are not going to what we are not going to do is we are going to look at this through regular eye and not be .,sport
if there is a quote unquote offensive head coach and a they get an offensive coordinator who is not ha no experience .,sport
ninety nine.nine of the time the head coach no matter who the fuck the offensive coordinator is is calling the place .,sport
it happens everywhere .,sport
if it is an advice person if it is a defensive guy and the defensive coordinator come in and he never been a defensive coordinator ever before the head coach is the one controlling the defense .,sport
the guy is learning .,sport
thats what happened with brian johnson .,sport
and in fact the shit wa being said that damn we do not even know brian johnson is even good because we do not know what wa his and what wa not his .,sport
we know that this offense that we saw last year looked very similar to the offense before stiking .,sport
here took over my only rebuttal .,sport
i am not tripping on what i live for the off here and i i am i watch these .,sport
here the thing ?,sport
when we watch football we all watch football ?,sport
when somebody call play .,sport
what are they doing ?,sport
they are going to cheat and doing this .,sport
you do not see that from nick sarian .,sport
unless it is motherfucking. . no no no .,sport
i am out. . i am not .,sport
hear me out .,sport
hear me out .,sport
he not sitting there with the board .,sport
let break that down .,sport
prior to the game they go over the game plan .,sport
nick siriani run not this year i am saying last year with brian johnson .,sport
kelli moore ha experience he not gon na be a handson with kelli moore at least i would think .,sport
he run through different scenario and tell brian johnson in these situation these are the play that i want you to choose from to what you call it .,sport
each situation the head coach will let if the head coach is yo not run the ball the office court are now asked to run the ball .,sport
if the what i am saying ?,sport
he may not it is this .,sport
this is what to your point this is what it is ?,sport
it is your playing madden you go into the formation .,sport
three play pop up on the screen .,sport
that is the three play or madden suggests is your play ?,sport
the offensive play to run .,sport
therell be three play up on the board .,sport
that is what madden is telling you .,sport
these are the three play .,sport
now obviously it is a little different .,sport
you can scroll and shit that but that is what it is .,sport
he ha three or four play .,sport
these are the play that sirianne would want you to run in this second and four at this field position at this point in the game .,sport
he may get to pick the play out of this small window but that window is created by the guy thats the head coach .,sport
in this particular case is sirianne .,sport
i hear you and i listen .,sport
you say he creating a friend .,sport
he the head coach .,sport
pull up the week schedule .,sport
can we talk about the same friend in dallas dave ?,sport
what you want to talk about ?,sport
dallas aint shit and the same friend .,sport
we are the most hated team bro .,sport
you couldnt get through this show without saying something .,sport
because i wa talking about this scene .,sport
he wa dallas baby with r.g .,sport
thats the topic .,sport
yo thats the thing .,sport
he not the same friend in dallas every year .,sport
that that that that that yeah .,sport
get your shit on .,sport
but that that that that .,sport
no thats not a robbery ?,sport
but the same way yall sat here and said if we help you we can be anybody .,sport
i think we help you .,sport
i do not think this year .,sport
we got the most injury in the league and we still average the most point per game in the league .,sport
we got twenty four point in detroit .,sport

man it wa definitely ... i wa definitely nervous in the beginning bro .,sport
when i saw that tenthree score .,sport
it wa seven up and then tenthree .,sport
and it is .,sport
whats happening here ?,sport
and i got a little ... i felt a little better when we tied it up .,sport
they tried to rob u . one and a half time .,sport
they tried to rob u . they did try it .,sport
they did try it it wasnt in 4k .,sport
they tried it but ... that out the jail of hurt .,sport
shout out to the people in the booth for looking out for u . because i did not know how they wa going to challenge that .,sport
because they did not call .,sport
they did not say it wa a touchdown .,sport
a far a i understand the rule ... it looked it wa about to be another play run. . it is a far a i understand the rule it is only an under review if it is a touchdown a far a i thought .,sport
i wa hey but it worked out for u . and we went in the ... in case yall did not know he wa talking about going in the halftime .,sport
going in the halftime we wa down tenthree .,sport
we had drove to the goal line .,sport
we wa trying to punch it in .,sport
it took u two try and it wa a ... it wa a touch push .,sport
and we did not get in and they reviewed it and they see jail and hurt .,sport
fort and gave enough effort to where we got to seven .,sport
then we went in the halftime tenten .,sport
we got a little bit of hit of ourselves at halftime but do you remember when it looked it wa about to go for two after we scored there ?,sport
do you remember whats feeling when you seeing that ?,sport
and what yall doing trying to go ... what they did .,sport
i wasnt ... i wa perplexed .,sport
i wa perplexed .,sport
i wa definitely why are we trying ... whats the difference between one point ?,sport
and then at the longer they took the hike i wa he trying to get through them all .,sport
once you start doing a hard count we knew it .,sport
but in the beginning i am what is we doing ?,sport
in case yall did not know the score we talked about it wa tenten and a halftime but this is the way it ended up .,sport
thirty sevenseventeen .,sport
beat them by dubb in cincinnati for the first win of the man .,sport
yall know tenten .,sport
but when in the halftime first of all we did not score a point in the first quarter .,sport
let address the elephant .,sport
that stat can go on another week .,sport
thats a weird stat .,sport
and i do not know whats going on with that .,sport
and i am not saying we wasnt rolling in the first quarter this week because we did score on our first drive this week .,sport
the stat will not necessarily show you that .,sport
but cincinnati when they came out they went down the field you said .,sport
they drove every third down converging .,sport
they wa getting it looked they were going to have the answer for our defense and all the philly fan the group text social medium not this again .,sport
they were snapping .,sport
they went down the field score seven .,sport
but that drive took almost eleven minute .,sport
and when we got the ball back we went on the long drive a . but we wound up getting three .,sport
but we did score on the first possession even though it wasnt in the first quarter .,sport
but we did start a little slow .,sport
but it wa back and forth man .,sport
they drove we drove .,sport
they drove we drove .,sport
this wa two team that shout out to the bangle because they are a good team .,sport
they are a solid team .,sport
but this wa a situation where it wa a dog fight .,sport
we showed some perseverance throughout the game .,sport
i think the first half i want to salute the defense because it looked it wa about to get bad man .,sport
it looked it could have they could have scored three time at least fourteen the way they went down the field in first two drive .,sport
but the defense made a few play man .,sport
off top smith nolan smith you starting to hoop bro .,sport
you starting to hoop .,sport
i aint going to say about time .,sport
this is second year .,sport
he starting to do his thing .,sport
he starting to get to the quarterback regularly .,sport
i am about to start expecting that from him now .,sport
he seemed he figuring it out .,sport
josh i think youve been solid all year .,sport
carter of course they wa double teaming him .,sport
i watch him all game man .,sport
they got to double him .,sport
it is they do not got no choice too .,sport
bryce huff had a few pressure but the defense played today man .,sport
shout out to fifty three man .,sport
that guy that guy solid bro .,sport
that guy is solid .,sport
i did not know about him .,sport
i aint know about him .,sport
i wa upset they did not let them white play .,sport
i did not that they let him go that .,sport
but looking at how i wa playing out with zach bond and dean .,sport
yeah i wa going to say mccoby dean you got to give them prop too man .,sport
especially we need honestly we need him to stay healthy because last season .,sport
this season for him and he got hurt .,sport
the problem is it we need him to stay healthy .,sport
but he always been considered tom on the kobe ha always been considered a good prospect for u . it is that can he play a full season ?,sport
and he starting to show that he definitely one of the guy that him and bond is definitely we got some good linebacker man .,sport
yeah yeah they played today .,sport
they played aggressive bond forced to turn over a crucial turnover .,sport
i think it wa in either late third or early fourth. . we punched the ball out of an awareness play .,sport
the defense played .,sport
thats what we getting to now .,sport
we getting around to saluting the defense .,sport
cornerback corner thats a that wa a tough we said we said last week that that wa going to be a tough matchup .,sport
jamar going against jamar chase and t higgins .,sport
and yeah yo we held him to seventeen point man .,sport
i only scored two touchdown .,sport
that that all if our cornerback stunk we should have got that score should have been flipped .,sport
it should have been worse .,sport
there no reason it shouldnt have been worse .,sport
and t higgins did not play today .,sport
he had a little quiet injury .,sport
he suffered friday and did not play .,sport
but jamar chase wa out there .,sport
boy wa out there and they got solid backup receiver and they got another quarterback .,sport
you definitely expect them to be able to do thing more thing versus the eagle in the pas game .,sport
and it doe show that our cornerback are here .,sport
and we did have slag with elwood injury .,sport
it looked a groan injury .,sport
i think that wa the second quarter .,sport
and he did not return .,sport
he made a hell of a play i think in the third quarter .,sport
it might have been the fourth quarter where he tipped the ball to put some cj dj to get a pick .,sport
and that added to that momentum we had at that time .,sport
but you said man sorry sorry coach you all but honestly you could debate if slay would have been able to on that route that particular route you had to have somebody fast to keep up with jamar chase even. . it is the biggest .,sport
you already know i said what we one or two i wa already questioning slay .,sport
it is yeah .,sport
and it is in some way the injury wa we still need him .,sport
we need all hand on deck .,sport
yeah yeah yeah yeah healthy slate .,sport
it wa a blessing in disguise kinda in the sense of i do not know if he would have been able to keep up with jamar chase to even deflect that in the cjs hand .,sport
. . and to put it in perspective bradbury aint play all season .,sport
he still more injured and reserved .,sport
a lot of people forgot he wa on the team .,sport
slade been playing he been playing but he went down he been bad on through injury the last couple of week .,sport
they caught up with him a little bit .,sport
but the young boy stepped up ringo came in made some play .,sport
isaiah rogers wa in there .,sport
we had cooper degene flying around .,sport
we had the youngers out there and they were holding their own .,sport
it did not look they were and cincinnati had the pas .,sport
they were down .,sport
it wasnt they came in there and they wa running the clock out on the other side .,sport
we got some piece in that deep back man .,sport
that we can stay healthy and keep it all together man .,sport
i am feeling good about our defensive back move before especially because we got james bradbury coming back .,sport
yo you got ta stop this james bradbury .,sport
you bring it up james .,sport
this quin yaw mitchell is playing .,sport
you up here talking about james bradbury .,sport

he he starting to be he doe what he doe .,sport
this is good to hear .,sport
it is already looking he doe what he doe man .,sport
he definitely doe what he doe man .,sport
and he did what he had to do today and the eagle did what they had to do today .,sport

and the defense definitely did their part of making sure we had a great week .,sport
but the offense had a few thing they wanted to say too .,sport
man how you feel about your boy jalen hurst today ?,sport
what man ?,sport
i think i may have to .,sport
it is one of those thing where it is sometimes when you are in relationship and stuff that .,sport
and you you have this expectation that these thing you want to happen .,sport
and then you end you settled in the relationship .,sport
and then you realize there come a point where you got to realize i got to see this person for who they are .,sport
who they are .,sport
who i am with .,sport
he doesnt have the arm the arm talent maybe that you want to necessarily have in regard to arm strength .,sport
arm strength if you want to have in your quarterback possibly .,sport
i could see that .,sport
and that play where he faked it here everybody on the left side .,sport
and he faked it to saquon and ran in for the touchdown .,sport
thats a cut .,sport
and then he balled .,sport
he doe that .,sport
he you do not think i have arm strength ?,sport
watch this .,sport
did it on the ground .,sport
did it through the air .,sport
check you out man .,sport
giving jalen praise at the same time dropping some real relationship advice for people out there thats watching .,sport
yall may be in relationship .,sport
you got to love the person you with .,sport
you got to accept the person you with .,sport
love their quality .,sport
do not expect something else .,sport
but you definitely got to hold them to the expectation of where they are doing what they should be doing and can be doing .,sport
and now jalen is doing that .,sport
and he balling today man .,sport
over two hundred yard passing .,sport
got to come over to hit .,sport
mad fact let go ahead to the stats man .,sport
and shout out to lauren over there on facebook checking u out .,sport

and we agree with that one hundred .,sport
shout out to you for tuning in .,sport
let go to the stats .,sport
thats what we are saying .,sport
he wa hooping .,sport
he wa sixteen for twenty .,sport
two hundred and thirty six yard one touchdown zero interception .,sport
thats the big one there .,sport
zero interception .,sport
thats the big one there .,sport

zero interception .,sport
thats big .,sport
not turning the ball over .,sport
and jalen hurt he also come with his foot what he do on the ground .,sport
he had ten for thirty seven and three touchdown .,sport
and that wa not one .,sport
but shout out to jalen hurt man .,sport
he definitely hooped .,sport
now i got to say man it is one of the best game i watched jalen hurt play .,sport
this year for sure since he been to eagle i know the number wasnt sexy .,sport
but they got the job done man .,sport
shout out to hurt man .,sport
this is one of the best game i say .,sport
my biggest problem with you is turning the ball over .,sport
you can not do that man .,sport
can not turn the ball over at that rate that you wa .,sport
and you cleaned that up man .,sport
i do not think you turned the ball over .,sport
last two game i think .,sport
last two game .,sport
at the brown he aint turned it over .,sport
he aint turned the last three game he did not turn it over. ?,sport
because remember we hit the tailgate .,sport
and if yall did not see the tailgate i think that wa episode number six or episode number five .,sport
we wa live at the eaglestales game .,sport
eagle versus brown .,sport
in case yall did not know this is the no box sport podcast .,sport
both of you buy no box sport entertainment man .,sport
this is our second season .,sport
this episode eight for u . but we got a whole season on youtube .,sport
go check out the archive the whole season one .,sport
we do a lot of eagle a lot of six .,sport
we mentioned the phillies and flyer sometime .,sport
but we do what we could do when we could do it .,sport
go check them episode out and catch up when we hang up off here today and tap in with u man .,sport
if you out there talk to u man we are going to start bringing fan on .,sport
we host and watch party .,sport
we doing a lot of thing .,sport
we trying to interact for the community with the community .,sport
because the esmer sport are the best man when it is done in community .,sport
when we get to share this win and this energy that man .,sport
but besides hertz man what stood out to you the most about the eagle win in cincinnati ?,sport
i am feeling good about .,sport
continue to feel good about saquon .,sport
first of all i do feel bad about will shipley .,sport
i wanted him to get that touchdown .,sport
the end of the game .,sport
that would have been great .,sport
he continued .,sport
i it is on the one hand i do not want jaylin to keep doing the tush push because i want him to preserve his body .,sport
because i thought saquon coming in would help maybe stop that .,sport
but honestly speaking if the idea is we trying to preserve saquon for the playoff i guess i got to fall back and say we got to do we got to do .,sport
but to saquon he continues to yo .,sport
that guy a great guy .,sport
a solid football player man .,sport
solid football player .,sport
and we not conserving him that .,sport
thats twenty two carry there in the board form .,sport
thats a lot of carry a lot of tackle a lot of not to mention the blocking and other thing that come with saquon .,sport
saquon is definitely carrying it man .,sport
we definitely got no complaint about that guy man .,sport
and when you finish in the game we finished in the game with a lead .,sport
and now we get to run the ball .,sport
and we are handing it to him .,sport
he already tired in our old line getting stronger .,sport
and shout out to the old line .,sport
let not go no further without paying homage to the old line man because .,sport
we are not even at full strength .,sport
nowhere near full strength .,sport
we down two starter man .,sport
and guy are stepping up .,sport
shout out to them .,sport
i did not look at this game today and feel we had a deficit at the old line .,sport
we had a penalty here and there .,sport
but overall you would expect u not to look we looked today .,sport
shout out to the old line .,sport
shout out to hertz .,sport
shout out to barclay .,sport
what i love about barclay man is that it is not only that he find the hole and we protect we give him the protection that he need to make those hole .,sport
but the bull also punishes guy man .,sport
he not giving no pass though .,sport
ken of gangwell ha to find a hole and hit it .,sport
and maybe duke a little bit of spin hell get through .,sport
but it is he not knocking guy over ?,sport
what ? .,sport
but saquon it is he can make a five yard carry .,sport
he did today make a five yard carry turn it to a ten yard run. . you got to tackle saquon .,sport
he quite he quite eight hundred pound .,sport
saquon not playing with people .,sport
when it come to tackling him in that fourth quarter off .,sport
yeah he in .,sport
i aint even going to speak on that .,sport
we got to get back healthy .,sport
jalen hurt i love the way you playing man .,sport
and and when miz wa on the show miz wa on episode seven .,sport
yall make sure yall go check that one out .,sport
miz talked about how he want to see jalen hurt more decisive when he going to run. . and today weve seen that .,sport
i see him hit two reed today and take off .,sport
and then thats what i want to see .,sport
i know lamar jackson is eight year in almost nine .,sport
but lamar jackson got to a point this year to where if you watched the raven play even if you watch that game of day he is doing whatever it take to win .,sport
whether that mean i am going to rush for ninety or i am going to throw for three hundred .,sport
it do not matter any given play .,sport
he got the ability to do it .,sport
if the play is there he going to if the play is to run he going to take that run .,sport
he not going to hesitate .,sport
but he also but also to your point he not always quick to run .,sport
he doe i need to i need to throw the ball to get this long first down .,sport
i am going to do that .,sport
but if i got the run ill do it .,sport
he definitely is .,sport
he going through that evolution now .,sport
i feel you start off doing what and he running a a quarterback .,sport
then you get to the point that we are what you wa saying ?,sport
i wa going to say my only concern when it come to u with the running with jalen is we got two number one receiver .,sport
and from my understanding of history number one receiver they want the ball .,sport
when you show those i am looking at those stats that you show .,sport
aint a lot of reception .,sport
between two number one receiver .,sport
it is six and five thats hopefully they good with that .,sport
hopefully whatever it take to win hopefully they good with that .,sport
if that becomes the formula where we doing they only getting six to five reception .,sport
i do not know how many target each of them have but let the six to five reception seems for two number one receivers. . hopefully everybody is about the team .,sport
thats my only concern .,sport
last year you heard a lot of stuff going on in regard to behind the scene where it is stuff there wa drama and stuff that .,sport
and they are working together yada yada what i am saying ?,sport
and thats definitely a concern .,sport
definitely a concern depending on the dynamic of your team .,sport
but i do think we got good dynamic with this team .,sport
they home a you can tell .,sport
we le likely to have a situation where one of them is hating on the other .,sport
and it seemed they both eating .,sport
they taking turn eating .,sport
and i think at the end of the year they both gon na have a thousand yard again .,sport
aj probably have a little bit more touchdown but smitty probably be there behind on .,sport
they both got their check .,sport
thats not a lot of ball to go around .,sport
but i when we win that .,sport
no i when we win that for sure for sure .,sport
because we playing solid .,sport
a win is a win but for u a fan but i do not know how we hope i hope that the guy if it is about hopefully they have the same mindset what i am saying ?,sport
they all got paid .,sport
that should also help too .,sport
the fact that they all did .,sport
they all got the check .,sport
it is not a thing where they playing for contract and you yo i need more ball .,sport
they got they got their money .,sport
hopefully that also help what i am saying ?,sport
but it is definitely if there ever a concern that could be a concern .,sport
people not that team chemistry being not a good a we hope it hope it is. . the defense i went to that .,sport
the bengal wa a good test .,sport
i definitely thought that going into this game the bengal wa a good test .,sport
it is knock them now they three and five because we made them three and five .,sport
thank you .,sport
but it is three and five for show .,sport
they are three and five .,sport
and it is you could skeptic the skeptic can say maybe they are not a good a we thought .,sport
they were what i am saying ?,sport
we are not doing that .,sport
we are not doing that today .,sport
we are not doing that at all man .,sport
you said what stood out to you the most in this win is saquon barkley .,sport
ill say what stood out me the most in this win is the character thats being developed by this team .,sport
to see cincinnati come out score first first drive .,sport
and then we go back with another long sustained drive and score three .,sport
and then cincinnati come out of score three and then we score .,sport
and then we keep building on that .,sport
we are standing there in barrage battle through injury battle through flaky call here and there .,sport
but at the end of the day shrink it together .,sport
and at the end of the game he looked at team in a face and say yall not effing with u . and he closed the book on them for real .,sport
and thats not a light team .,sport
thats not an easy team to do that too .,sport
they not shouted out with patrick mahomes .,sport
they not shouted out with the best of them .,sport
they not went to the super bowl already .,sport
thats not an easy team to sit there and do that too .,sport
this eagle team i do not know man .,sport
i am feeling good about this win .,sport
everybody feeling good about this win .,sport
you think we are turning the corner ?,sport
are we turning the corner a a football team ?,sport
it is this the start of something great for the eagle ?,sport
i aint ready to say that yet .,sport
is this the start of a super bowl run for the eagle ?,sport
i aint ready to say that yet .,sport
i aint ready to say that yet .,sport
we won three straight but they wa against the browns. . the giant .,sport
and the bengal .,sport
out of those three the bengal probably .,sport
thats cool .,sport
thats solid team .,sport
we aint play no bum there .,sport
what you mean ?,sport
the bum we play .,sport
the giant they aint that great .,sport
they got daniel jones .,sport
they not great .,sport
they are nfc east team .,sport
and they tough with anybody else .,sport
they play it is that we send them around that .,sport
the giant got a few win this season .,sport
they they carry that a little bit .,sport
they got the best the most sack in the league .,sport
i am not going to act they a walk over team because we walked over .,sport
the brown beat the raven today .,sport
and we going to have a look around the league .,sport
boom. . boom. . i aint saying we going but philly fan .,sport
i do not know about you .,sport
but i am the type of fan that want to win a championship every year .,sport
and if we can not win a championship is it take the joy out of it for me .,sport
but this one of them year where i am looking this this the door is still open on this year for championship .,sport
but hey i aint saying it .,sport
yeah me. . we turn in the corner now .,sport
now what should we do ?,sport
i think thats too early man .,sport
too early .,sport
i think it is too early .,sport
you got to see who we play next week .,sport
but i feel it is too early bro .,sport
what you need to what you need to see to say we turn on the corner two more win in a row .,sport
two more win .,sport
thats it .,sport
see some people see before others .,sport
i am going to say this wa a my you medal win in our season .,sport
and a long a we can build on this and not lay a egg next week and we see this team stacking it together because it looked the type of team that take the step and stack the box up and at the end they stepping at the top .,sport
hold on .,sport
you said it is they turn the corner .,sport
it wa a big one .,sport
yeah it wa a big one .,sport
turn in a corner .,sport
but i do not know about saying if i say they turn the corner .,sport
you do not think this defense you do not think this defense is getting to a point where they understand the scheme and confident and running around and using their talent making play .,sport
they are making play but we but but you also have to consider the level of talent they are playing against .,sport
and this is the first one .,sport
we got we need more good team were playing against where i can say that .,sport
we i do not agree with you about the giant and the brown but i will not belabor it .,sport
but thats my we disagree on it .,sport
he think we need to slow down eagle fan .,sport
he is of the elk that you need to chill .,sport
you need to see some more .,sport
this is a season eagle fan saying that i am a season eagle fan saying that listen we turn the listen when you walk around that corner before your body get there in our shoulder come around that corner now we aint all around it .,sport
but we to .,sport
who about round there ?,sport
yeah super bowl around the corner .,sport
all i am saying is eagle fan stay on stay on .,sport
we ride this thing .,sport
it is a beautiful thing .,sport
but enough about our eagle .,sport
and we are going to go take a little glance around the league because when we talk about turning the corner the rest of the league got this around that corner .,sport
but we did talk about the brown already .,sport
you mean they beat the raven .,sport
we going to look around the league .,sport
the brown did beat the raven .,sport
i do not know if youve got a chance to see anything a far a that go .,sport
but listen that game wa wild .,sport
that wa that wa it went down to the last play man .,sport
incredible play .,sport
hell mary hell mary play .,sport
if he got the ball in the last play thats a scary sight .,sport
but cleveland survived .,sport
james winston stephen started for the first time for his homey to sean watson and got the win .,sport
man they put up some bucket .,sport
i played against i played .,sport
i had the raven defense and fantasy and it aint go too for me .,sport
but i am shot out to the shot .,sport
i wa shocked by that .,sport
he he pulled up twenty nine point .,sport
thats impressive .,sport
twenty nine .,sport
it wa twenty nine to four .,sport
james winstons pas for three thirty four three tetties .,sport
yeah he went twenty seven for forty one .,sport
he wa out there hooping man .,sport
let keep looking around the league .,sport
though what else happened today ?,sport
detroit man they foot the .,sport
fifty two with the team .,sport
do against the titan .,sport
yeah they did with the team doing against the titan .,sport
detroit is the most .,sport
if i had to pick the best team in the nfc now on some non bias stuff i would have to say detroit is the best team in the nfc .,sport
they have shown it the most consistently .,sport
the firepower is there at elite firepower .,sport
and they got some defense to back it up .,sport
they is missing a hut to say he went down with the injury .,sport
but they looking good .,sport
the bill beat the seahawks thirty one ten .,sport
josh island on josh island thing .,sport
they are super bowl contender for sure .,sport
keep your eye on that .,sport
hold on man .,sport
look at all that .,sport
let talk about the big game that happened at the end of the day .,sport
come on man .,sport
thats out of the vision .,sport
thats the big game .,sport
that man .,sport
the bear washington commander versus chicago bear man .,sport
and that wa it wa a it wa a thriller .,sport
i do not know if you are seeing it or not .,sport
but how did it end ?,sport
what wa the last play of that game ?,sport
he threw up daniel threw up a hell mary pas .,sport
the defender tipped it to believe noah brown .,sport
and he paid attention and caught that john in the end zone game over .,sport
that a lot of time those hell mary pass man .,sport
and it doesnt he always the guy dropped it for every reason .,sport
it come to me whether it is the thing or he caught the ball and they won the game off that job .,sport
but i got to say that wa the perfect tip .,sport
but this is the case yall do not know the the washington one eighteen to fifteen .,sport
it wa a pretty low scoring game .,sport
it came down to the end .,sport
chicago had drove down and scored a touchdown with fifty second left .,sport
and it looked they wa about to win in washington and washington somehow getting to the position .,sport
throw a hell mary and win the game on the last play of the game .,sport
walk off touchdown .,sport
they look crazy .,sport
if you aint see it yet go check it out .,sport
it is definitely worth going to go watch the highlight man .,sport
and now the washington command is a six and two and leading the division .,sport
i think we got to match with them in two week .,sport
it is going to be a battle man .,sport
they a tough team down there to get magic at the last second now .,sport
they are going to be something to deal with man .,sport
but we aint got to deal with them now .,sport
but that game wa something that the cowgirl i think they playing now .,sport
they playing a 49ers and the score look it is seventy three to cowgirl winning this early second quarter .,sport
well see what happened in that game man .,sport
and thats nasty .,sport
hey man whoever played the cowboy i am sorry it is always going to be against the cowboy .,sport
it is always going to be whoever i am always rooting for the team against the cowboy .,sport
but i guess i can root for a draw .,sport
ill go with that .,sport
we can go with that .,sport
i guess ill go with that .,sport
but next week man we got to turn the page .,sport
we celebrate the night but we do not stay there for too long man .,sport
we got business to handle .,sport
the next opponent i think is the jagwell jacksonville jaguar man .,sport
jacksonville jaguar they coming to philly dougie p trevor lawrence .,sport
who else they got ?,sport
brian thomas junior travis etn tank bigsby .,sport
they got some piece .,sport
they can put up a good game .,sport
they are that type of team that if you do not prepare properly ?,sport
and you think they sweet you will end up in a dog fight that you do not need to be it .,sport
let hope this team thats when i say we got to build those block up .,sport
the next block will be coming in next week and handling them how we supposed to .,sport
not having it look crazy it is shaky again .,sport
next week man let preview the game a little bit .,sport
we got the eagle .,sport
we might we might be missing slay not sure .,sport
we had some encouragement by the rookie db .,sport
we should be all .,sport
otherwise i do not know the status on my lot of .,sport
and i do not think he going to be back .,sport
the boy beacon .,sport
yeah god it wa out with the hand me .,sport
i do not know whats going on there .,sport
this is after the game .,sport
we do not got the health report .,sport
but monitor that .,sport
but even with that in mind man how you feeling about that game versus jacksonville ?,sport
jack it is an expected win .,sport
they say what they say those those loss are scheduled .,sport
that should be a schedule one for u . it shouldnt be twenty to sixteen .,sport
again but i am not going to jinx them i did against the brown .,sport
i am going to be quiet on the score .,sport
but it should be a win it is yeah we should .,sport
and i am definitely going to pick a win too .,sport
i pick it a win a a win before the season .,sport
although for transparency i did pick u to lose today because i knew we never won in cincinnati and i now watch some weird game in cincinnati and this trauma behind this cincinnati the eagle in cincinnati .,sport
and today seeing the win felt real good because i never seen that before .,sport
this is the first win .,sport
now it make sense in the history .,sport
when i seen that on the schedule i wa no it is it is not going down .,sport
but thats why you thats why you are excited about all the time in the corner .,sport
could you try and make up for the fact that it might be it .,sport
it might be it .,sport
that might be it .,sport
i aint going to let the therapist might say the same thing .,sport
if she heard me say thats what that could have been .,sport
but we still .,sport
even if you do not see our shoulder we you hear u . you hear that the eagle come around the corner .,sport
but no i feel we should win too man .,sport
i feel we should beat them .,sport
i do not feel it should be close .,sport
i am not going to say we should cook them by a certain amount but i feel we should have the game in hand in the fourth quarter .,sport
well ship .,sport
we should finally go ahead and get the kid touchdown at the end of the game .,sport
and we five and two after seven after eight week of the nfl season .,sport
and this is what i had a at five and two .,sport
it happened very different than i said it would happen .,sport
that is true .,sport
but this is what i had to say .,sport
i had u losing to green bay and i had u losing the cincinnati far .,sport
the team .,sport
but we are what i thought we would be .,sport
it is the part of the season where i thought we can hit a shrine and let the league know we serious and get our rhythm going to see can we start to dominate team a we get into our identity which nick sariani said is physical .,sport
physical identity .,sport
but shout out to the philadelphia eagle man on getting that win today man .,sport
we are wrapping up the eagle talk but today wa a good day for many of reason .,sport
many of reason man .,sport
we see multiple way today .,sport
and then a certain sport we seen the first one .,sport
it wa a day of first man .,sport
it wa the eagle first ever win in cincinnati. . and it wa the 76ers first win of the nba season in the overtime thriller to the indiana pacer man .,sport

we had nothing to match it .,sport
but then we went into ronto and we lost .,sport
they handled u down there .,sport
defensively the left bothered u . they were they were sharper than this .,sport
and maxi wasnt on he been shooting a lot but not at a efficiency rate .,sport
and they got u . today we wa going to indiana who wa a good team a team that went to the eastern conference .,sport
find those last year team that suspected to do thing a team thats healthy .,sport
we were imposing looking at the sixth schedule without him being in pg .,sport

he he had a great game today although he almost made a mistake that cause at the end but it did not cost u . oobre still squished army knife whatever you need. . kenyan martin jr. and elevated minute .,sport
i the way he look .,sport
he athletic smart basketball player .,sport
he playing andre german doing his thing .,sport
yeah seventeen board thirty seven minute .,sport
that is major .,sport
and he say he the greatest rebounder of all time .,sport
thats what he is telling people .,sport
seventeen rebound you backing it up .,sport
you can not have anything now with you the greatest rebound of all time .,sport
you got at least twelve .,sport
but shout out to the sixer man .,sport
you give your way to early assessment of how they look .,sport
and even though we a little fracture now we looking we are without george and it be we look we solid .,sport
if we got those guy we do not have those guy .,sport
we are we are probably a ninth seeded team if that .,sport
and i am sorry about maxi but maxi not that guy yet .,sport
he not .,sport
he not that guy yet to carry a team to top five in the conference. . but but when those guy come back i am definitely encouraged that yo we look a solid team .,sport
we look a solid team .,sport
but we got to have those two guy back .,sport
we got to have those guy back .,sport
but i will say my early assessment is the nba is in trouble because what he said without without pg without him being i do not think he his ninth place .,sport
i think he carried it there maybe six seven .,sport
now you got to realize we looking this because we we wa preparing to go without him be .,sport
but the pg injury happened last week .,sport
weve been playing with pg .,sport
weve been setting up the offense with pg .,sport
not there now .,sport
it is maxi and them .,sport
they trying to figure this whole thing out on the fly and weigh the buck .,sport
we should have people saying we should have been toronto .,sport
toronto might be a tough team around that six to ten area fighting .,sport
they got playmaker .,sport
they got a length .,sport
they compete and we be the playoff team .,sport
maxi aint necessarily look good this season a far a efficiency condition in a good but he he a little bit off and more of them should not start falling today .,sport
but but i think if we had to keep building with this team we would get the point to where we would be toronto .,sport
not saying we will be cooking them but we will be a solid team somewhere around six seven .,sport
but even saying that i do not want to even think of a world of where we would have to do that because we got two star .,sport
we are about to insert back in .,sport
my thing is that we could be a six seven caliber type team that can go at a number one team without two all star and one generation of talent .,sport
also future hall of famers .,sport
when we put them two back in we are going to have to figure it out .,sport
but i might start looking how the eagle look where we play our game .,sport
is not much anybody going to be able to do .,sport
and then thats what i am seeing with the sixer team .,sport
i am not saying they turn in the corner because we did not even see it yet .,sport
but it is about the ashley .,sport
they walking down the block .,sport
they walking down the block .,sport
i am about to ask you .,sport
i say you feel they turn .,sport
here. . there .,sport
they here .,sport
we are going to be all man .,sport
yeah we need those guy back .,sport
we definitely need those guy .,sport
we are not without those two guy .,sport
i am not sure i am with you on the faith walk .,sport
i do not even want to think of our team without those guy at all .,sport
thats fair .,sport
pistions down here .,sport
i am at the at the whats we call the well fargo center now .,sport
i do not know how long it is going to be the well fargo center .,sport
they talking about some other thing .,sport
some aint the secret moving and moving the stadium .,sport
but we down there we wanted to play the detroit piston .,sport
they own three .,sport
but k. cunningham is hoping now .,sport
i feel we should be able to get the two and two versus them .,sport
i do not know how you feel .,sport
i do not think we have until we get our two guy back .,sport
far the three game that weve shown i do not feel overly confident about anybody .,sport
there nobody that we can say we should win that game .,sport
no it is going to be a good game to probably .,sport
it might be a close game .,sport
it is the piston and they supposedly still stink .,sport
we probably gon na be close for u . philly .,sport
you are we philly .,sport
one thousand and thirty .,sport
id be about one thousand and thirty .,sport
one thousand and thirty twenty four .,sport
i thought of something .,sport
philly this is three day from now .,sport
whats that ?,sport
that wednesday .,sport
the wednesday .,sport
and b might be back that game .,sport
they say and b could play at .,sport
they say he might sit the first three game .,sport
this wa planned .,sport
they say hell be reevaluated .,sport
he can possibly be in the lineup .,sport
he not recovering from an injury .,sport
he gearing up properly .,sport
they do not want him to go from .,sport
they do not want him to .,sport
you got an old car and you build you trying to speak somewhere you can not go zero to twenty .,sport
thats why somebody pulled up one of you at next to the light in the old car .,sport
you look straight .,sport
you do not even look at him .,sport
when your car got that giddy up you looking over whats up ?,sport
it doe and b he that type of car that is vintage can do whatever any car can do .,sport
but we got to ramp him up .,sport
we can not let him go .,sport
and i am surprised that nba is hating on it hard because he sitting back .,sport
the bag are not playing early .,sport
i get off fire situation man .,sport
i guess the art .,sport
thats the age .,sport
i will not say age but thats the argument that people have in regard to you .,sport
it is i get that aspect .,sport
when you go to see the temptation back in the day or any group it is you want to see the 10th .,sport
you aint want to see a bunch of fake people want to see david weffin .,sport
you aint got to try to see .,sport
i come to see you on this drumming .,sport
i am saying it is come on now .,sport
you want to see the star .,sport
that aspect i will not go against at all .,sport
thats drawn .,sport
i do not care about that though .,sport
it is called gambling and sport and entertainment .,sport
anything can happen .,sport
anything can happen from game to game .,sport
you spend that money even if they are not playing .,sport
you go down to the stadium .,sport
you have a good time .,sport
you get in the mix and you enjoy it because you paid your money .,sport
whoever regardless of who on the floor .,sport
but i think thats their issue .,sport
i think thats their issue in regard to why they do it because they try to at least give the front at least give the perpetration that we are trying to do what we write whats for the fan and stuff that .,sport
i am thats why they do these whole investigation and stuff that .,sport
i do not think they should have came out and said it i do not .,sport
i do not know why and be .,sport
i am not going to play back to back .,sport
why are you saying that and be i probably never again in my career .,sport
he get to the point where he do not care no more .,sport
i do not know about your impression but you are a funny guy .,sport
you got a better impression than me .,sport
you got to trust it .,sport
no would you write it ?,sport
you write it is it is ill allow .,sport
no you write .,sport
they should they should have did what quiet them always .,sport
they he can not play tonight for whatever reason make up an injury .,sport
do not write it .,sport
i say all that to say and be might be back wednesday night and even if he not back with the team i am projecting to beat them if the team with him be the team without him be .,sport
and to be clear somebody coming back to the city that day he coming for blood .,sport
