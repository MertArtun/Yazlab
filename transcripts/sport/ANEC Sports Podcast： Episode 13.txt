 You're watching the ADC Sports Podcast on YouTube. The show starts right now. Welcome to episode 13 of the ADC Sports Podcast. My name is Sam Frick, founder and editor at Around the Northeast Corner, covering 30 schools across Northeast Indiana and parts of Elkart County. That includes the ADC, the ACAC, and the Northeast AIDS. And so the first week of the football sectionals are completed. The regional section of volleyball has been completed. Cross country is now into its final week of the season as the state finals will take place on Saturday. And exactly one week from now, the first official week of the 2024-2025 high school girls basketball season. College basketball is already underway across the nation. And so we are not too far off from basketball becoming a everyday talk here at Around the Northeast Corner. And so we'll talk about basketball, especially next week, as I will have some guests on basketball to preview some of the opening games coming up that week. But without further ado, let's go ahead and discuss the football aspects of the state tournament. And I think when we kick things off with class 1A, I think we have to discuss with, obviously, 1A sectional 43, the Fremont Eagles down seven sets, I believe early in that game, there was a delay due to some light malfunction at Northfield, was the host of that game. And Fremont came back led by Colton Armstrong's three rushing TDs and the Fremont Eagles defeats the Norse by the score of 35 to 21. And now the Fremont Eagles find themselves in a very interesting position playing in the sectional semifinals for the first time in a long time at Fremont, first time since 2018, that Fremont is playing in the second round of the sectional tournament. They'll take on a very strong North Miami team that's eight and two on the season. They defeated the Black Hawk Christians in their very first postseason appearance, 54 to 14. I will discuss more in detail about those matchups in a later video, but congratulations to Fremont on their first round win in the playoffs for football. 1A 44, South Adams cruised to the 51 to nothing win over the Union City Indians. They are going to be traveling down south to try high school. They'll take on a very good try tightens team that likes to run the football. And this will be the ACAC game of the week at around the Northeast corner, South Adams, looking to punch their ticket to the sectional championship game that sweet. Also, by the way, Madison Grant did defeat Monroe Central. They are seeing the favorites in that sectional. They defeated Monroe Central 38 to seven. They're going to be taking on Hangers Town, Madison Grant seen as the heavy favorites to win that matchup there, as well as winning the sectional altogether. You look at 2A sectional 35, Adams Central cruised to the 35 seven win over Bluffton, Matt Heiser with a touchdown and then Cameron Frable having a strong game defensively, of course. And then Jameson rose the quarterback to the bottom of Adams Central combined for three touchdowns total and that win over the Bluffton Tigers. They are going to be hosting the Cherubusco Eagles. They were down 23 to 20 early in the game. They came back to score 22 on answers. And they came back to beat the Manchester Squires, the home team in that contest by the score of 42 to 23. Angelou Iniceli is one of the nominees for the performer of the week at around the northeast corner for football. He had 25 carries for 226 yards and three TDs. Two catches for 14 yards and additional touchdown in that win over the Squires. Busco is going to have to play their best football going to the landing strip in a row down in Adams County to take on the three-time Rainstay finalist, the Adams Central flying Jets. You then have Eastside defeating Whitco 35 to seven off of the tremendous performance by Joe Richmond of Eastside nine carries for 126 yards and three for 90 yards with three touchdowns in that win over the Wildcats. They are going to travel to Prairie Heights. They're going to be taking on the Weedah Heights, Weedah Heights of Prairie, however you want to call them, Prairie Heights Panthers. Five and five on the season. They already had the most wins in a single season. Since 2013 and Prairie Heights is one win away from their most wins in a season since 1986 when they won seven games that year. I will be discussing this season of Prairie Heights football with your head coach, Pat McCray, later in the show. But Prairie Heights will be hosting that matchup against the Eastside Blazers. And then you look at three ace sectional 26, Garrett Cruz to the 50 to 26 win over Lakeland, three players rushed for 100 yards, Alex Guzman, Cam Rubel and Calder. Hefty also threw for about, I believe it was like 89 past yards or something like that. And a pair of touchdowns for the Garrett Railroaders as they will be traveling to Death Valley to take on the Tippie Valley Vikings who dominated the Woodland Warriors 51, 25, 73 Tippie Valley hosting 10 and 0 Garrett. And that will be the NECC game of the week at around the Northeast corner. West Noble dominate and goal 42 to 14 led by Seth Carrute. Once again, leading the way for the Chargers, Backfield, 22 carries for 143 yards, two touchdowns and he became the career rushing leader in the history of West Noble High School for rushing yards. He has over 1600 rushing yards going into this week. They're gonna be hosting the Fairfield Falcons, their arch nemesis from Highway 33, Airfield defeated the Concordia Cadets in the first round of the sectional by the score of 48 to 34, 31 carries for 270 rushing yards and three TDs from Breck and Marin, one of the seniors on this Fairfield team and Coach Stoner has the Falcons flying high going that matchup against the West Noble Chargers. And anytime you play a rivalry game in the postseason, it just amplifies things just a little bit more between these two rivals that clearly do not like each other whatsoever. And I think this is gonna be a fun matchup in the near at least at the start, we'll see if Fairfield can hang around in this game. I'll get the very good West Noble team. Like I said earlier with Seth Pruitt, I mean rushing for over 4,500 yards going into that matchup and setting the career rushing leader at West Noble. You also have 68 career touchdowns as well. 3,828 Bishop Lures dominated Norwell by the score of 42 to seven. They're going to Jay County take on the Jay County Patriots who defeated Belmont 42 to seven. They had a lineman with a pitch six at Jay County that was Austin Shaneline. Sorry, welcome back. I apologize in advance. It appeared at my computer died during the recording. So we'll go ahead and resume where we left off here. We talked about three essential 28 Jay County who faced Bishop Lures at Jay County on Friday. Delta defeated the Heritage Patriots 54 to 14 where Delta ran, I would guess over 300 yards rushing in that game. And unfortunately for Heritage, it seemed like they were limping into playoffs. I didn't think they'd be limping this much in the playoffs, but I think in the end, they Delta just simply played better football than the Heritage Patriots. That's two years in a row where Delta came into the postseason with a mediocre record. Although a very hard conference in the Hoosier Heritage Conference. And Delta is having success so far in the state tournament. Mrs. Sennewa, I cannot overlook the Delta Eagles undefeated Mrs. Sennewa was gonna be hosting Delta or Miss, took care of business against O'Kale after a slow first half. They scored 21 unanswered in the second half to the beats. The O'Kale Golden League, the O'Kale Golden League, the O'Kale Golden League, the O'Kale Golden League, down in Gas City, shifting over to Class 4A, we're gonna be talking about four-challenge, very briefly because it's sectional where most of the matches were not particularly the most exciting. Huntington North set a new program record for most points scored in a single game, defeating the Frankfurt hot dog 77-8. And the Vikings now have seven wins on the season. They'll be hosting a five and four, Marion Giants team, kind of an underwhelming Marion team this season. And they are one win away from a spot in the sectional finals, which will be played against either Logan Sports or Lebanon. Huntington North will be on the road, no matter who it is. And Logan's four and nine and one this season, they're coming off a 35-13, one over Muncie Central. Probably gonna be underdogs in this matchup against Lebanon, who came back from an early deficit to defeat Culver Canemies in the fourth quarter. 35-32, Culver Canemies was seen as probably the slight favorites to even win that sectional. And now Lebanon, the Tigers of Lebanon, have a chance to play for a sectional championship. And for the Lebanon Tigers, only one sectional championship in their entire history. It goes all the way back to 1997. So it's been a long time coming for the Tigers and for Huntington North fans, Huntington North with their best season since the 2008 campaign at least. And Huntington North, one sectional title as well, coming all the way back to 1993. So we could see a pleasant regional bound team in coming out of this sectional over the next couple of weeks. And then we look at for a sectional 19 to wrap things up in football coverage. East Noble took care of business against Southside by the score of 45-7 in Kinderville, Dylan Krell once again doing Dylan Krell things as he had 10 carries for 164 yards and three TDs. That is for all you math folks out there. There's 16.4 yards for Kerry for Dylan Krell. And East Noble is gonna get that rematch against Leo Lyons at Lyons Field. That is going to be the ANEC game of the week at around the northeast corner as East Noble set to embark on their rematch from week number five where East Noble defeated Leo 35-29. A key matchup that ultimately decided the northeast state in favor of the East Noble Knights winning the conference to themselves. East Noble looking for their first sectional championships 2020, Leo looking to repeat for the first time since 2011 for football and they will, in the winter that matchup will face either Bishop Dwainier or the Wayne Generals. And if Wayne wins in that matchup against Dwainier, Wayne will be the visiting team in the sectional finals at either East Noble or Leo. If Dwainier wins this matchup against Wayne, Dwainier will be the host of this sectional championship. So, Dwainier coming off of 38-nothing went over Columbia City. So Columbia City, Columbia City season ends at eight and two. Dwainier won 38-nothing, which I think a lot of us did not expect it to be that lopsided, although we kind of expected Dwainier to be in this game and I did predict Dwainier to advance. So that's not super surprising by the outcome, but I think the score was a little bit more surprising than I think most people anticipated. And then Wayne took care of business against New Haven, but the Generals are going to have their hands full against Dwainier, a team that they did not play this season. In fact, they have not played Bishop Dwainier in the regular season since before the divisions were implemented. But they did play them last year and they lost by 11 points against Dwainier and now we get an opportunity to see just where the Generals of Wayne stacked up against a very strong defense from Bishop Dwainier, especially with Kumar Nelson and Wayne at lineback or running back, he's the guy that could be very interesting as well for the Wayne Generals. Now let's go ahead and shift over to volleyball over the weekend on Saturday. Volleyball regional Saturday took place across the entire state of Indiana and unlike past years, this year was the first year with a new format for volleyball. It's pretty similar to the basketball, baseball, softball state format where you have the one game regional and then you have the two game semi-state. This past weekend was the one game regional. We had a few schools from the AAC area that competed on Saturday. We'll go ahead and start with the ACAC and we'll begin with Newcastle and Heritage. Heritage, unfortunately, saw their season coming to an end at the hands of the Newcastle Trojans, a 25-win Newcastle team to which Newcastle swept the Heritage Patriots 25-22, 25-19, and 26-24. So Heritage had an opportunity to even win this match, but in the end, Newcastle just a little bit better that day. Newcastle will be part of this 3A semi-state that we'll talk about in another video. As far as Woodland's concerned, they did take care of business in the regional and Woodland remains undefeated all the time against regional competition, three straight, sorry, not three straight sectional titles, three sectional titles, three regional championships for the first time since 2013. Woodland is going to semi-states. And now the Woodland Warriors have an opportunity to embark some history, make a run to the state finals, which I believe they've been to the state, been to Ball State at least once in their history, but I believe it was during the time in which they had the state semi-finals and then the state finals hosted in a single week or day. I'm not 100% sure, but that was a different format at the time and there was no semi-state back then in 2007 where you had regionals and then you go to the state finals, which was semi-finals and then the real state finals. Woodland, I believe, was part of it at one point. Woodland took care of business against Lakeland. They won this match three sets to one. I believe the first set was like 25 to 17. Second set went to Lakeland 25-22. Woodland took the final two sets 25-20 and 55-10, unless Anderson continues to lead the way of the Woodland Warriors, I believe she had well over 20 kills in that match. I think you look at even other players in that matchup that contribute for Woodland. Obviously, you look at Kenna Smith at LaBarrell, played a monster game on defense for the Woodland Warriors. The front row was awesome against Lakeland, especially down the stretch. You look at a player like, let's see, Katie Bottoms, the sophomore, some big kills down the stretch to seal the deal against the Lakeland Lakers. Hallards-Jackway and defensive specialists had a big game as well. I looked at, again, just the front row, just had a monster game against Lakeland. And now Woodland has the opportunity to get to the safe files. We'll talk about Woodland's semi-state matchup in a separate video. We take a look at the Northeast Corner Conference. The NEA obviously didn't have any teams advancing past sectional. So really, it was just the ACAC and the NECC, and the only other two members from the NECC that played. Fremont played South Newton in the regional finals. I believe they were at LaPorte. And unfortunately for the Fremont Eagles, they were unable to come back from an O2 deficit, and they fell in four sets at the hands of South Newton. The Rebels of South Newton, they took the first two sets, 25-18 and 25-22. Fremont took the third set, 25-15, but fell short in set four, 25-20. You look at South Newton statistically, they were led by the Central Michigan Commit, Taylor Creight with 22 kills on 47% hitting. She had three aces, two blots, seven dids. You also look around this South Newton team, number 19 for them, and that is Briley Iceminger with 19 dids. They had a couple of girls with three blots on this South Newton team, a couple of girls in double figures, including number 22, the freshman Jada Creight with 12 kills, and another senior Madison Bullinger with 10 kills. And unfortunately for Fremont, that means the end of high school valuable careers for Addy Parr, for Claire Folt, who's going to St. Francis, for Delaney Bach, and for Millenia Miller, at least, I might be blanking one more name. I think they also have Lexi Stevens, who's also a senior, and she plays on the softball team at Fremont. Yeah, that's right, the Defensives Specialist, who you're talking about, outside hitter, Libero, Defensives Specialist, another outside hitter slash Defensives Specialist, as well as their center, Claire Folt. They do return some pieces back, including, I would say, Kaylee Neuens-Schwander would be a one to keep an eye on net season for the Fremont Eagles. I looked at, maybe play like Mallory Huffnagle, Huffnagle's are pretty well-known athletes at Fremont. Emma Crager, their center defense specialist, who's only a sophomore. I look at her for a potential emergence, Chloe Verden. They're a sophomore defense specialist, another one, and then hardly wise, another middle, who's a junior this season. But obviously, it's been a little bit different net season for Fremont volleyball, but no less the first ever sectional championship in the history of Fremont volleyball, and they came two sets shy of winning their first ever regional. But thankfully for the folks in Angola, they were able to take care of business, but it did require some drama, some stress, and some five sets, and a five set throw. And a five set thriller. West Lafayette took the first set 25-19, Angola took the next two sets 25-18 and 25-12. West Lafayette scored a final three point of that set to win 25-22, and then Angola, despite blowing an eight three lead in the fifth set, to which West Lafayette tied in at eight, the Hornets score seven of the final 10 points, and they defeat the West Lafayette Red Devils 15-11, the fifth set to win that first ever volleyball regional, three sets to two, and Coach Harris and the Endola Hornets are halfway there to ball states worth an arena and a state championship for Class 3A. I'll be speaking with the two Harris sisters at Angola, Ava Harris, the senior center, Maya Harris, the junior outside hitter, both players committing at the highest level division one athletics. Once their endola high school careers come to an end, we will be speaking with those two Harris sisters about this season up to this point, as well as that regional championship game. They will be taken on Hammond Bishop-Knoll at Plymouth on Saturday. I will be talking about the semi-state pairings in a separate video. And then lastly, I do wanna make sure I address the IHSW-A cross country regionals as the two regionals we primarily focus on around the Northeast corner. They take place at New Prairie and New Haven. We'll make this one pretty short for New Prairie because I think only a handful of them really were able to advance to states or cross country. One thing I will say for the boys section at New Prairie, Noah Bond, trader of the Westview Warriors, successfully won a regional championship at a time of 15 minutes and 13 seconds. I'm not sure how I remembered it so fluently, but here I am with my awesome photo memory, remembering all the statistics and whatnot, and also Evan Corle of Fairfield placed 12th in that regional at New Prairie. Keep in mind, I am not looking at this right now. So this is just off of memory. And I will tell you, just without any doubt, those are the only two that I remember advancing to state from that regional. Now, as far as the regional hosted by Huntington University, which technically would be considered to be New Haven as the host, nevertheless, a lot of local kids were able to advance to that regional hosted by Huntington University. We'll start off with the ladies. Kenya Leach at Columbia City placed third at Columbia City. And thankfully for the team, they scored well enough. I think they had about 103 points and they finished third as a team to advance to the state finals as a team for the first time since 2010. So all of the Columbia City players on the girls side, they're playing in the state finals, no matter of their placing. Alan's freezing of Huntington North. So Kenya Leach is a sophomore freezing, also a sophomore. She finished in fourth place. Rowan Norris of Leo finished fifth, another sophomore. Chloe Gibson of East Snow will place seventh. And then senior Ashlyn Myers of Prairie Heights finished 15. Now among those qualifying that on non-qualifying teams, usually top 15, it's usually the state finals, but keep in mind that there are teams that finish the top five that do advance no matter what. So there are some players on non-qualifying teams that still advance no matter what. And that would be Sophia Haslet of Lake Park Group placed 16th. Katie Niles of Woodland placed 21st. Madison Gerber of Adams Central placed 23rd. And then Abediel Ramseyer of Lufthin placed 29th. So congratulations to these ladies as they advance to the state finals hosted by Tarot on Saturday. And then on the boys' section, Ryan Garcia of New Haven placed second. Followed by Zinner right now of Lakewood Park at third. Gavin Good of Columbia City placed sixth. Andrew Stronger of Si placed eighth. Memphis Martin of Lakeland placed 10th. Daniel Moll of Columbia City placed 12th. Cooper Enure of Angola placed 13th. And then for those that did not place on top 15 but still qualified on non-qualifying teams, Kayden Clink of Angola placed 19th. The Co-Disprunner of South Adams placed 23rd. Gavin Cook of Angola placed 24th. And then Jude Baumgarner of Lufthin just getting in those last couple of spots at 25th. They are all going to the state finals hosted by Tarot. And this is the final week of the cross country season. As the fall season starts to wrap up. I lie, there is one other thing I do want to make sure I address here and that is soccer. Unfortunately, the soccer season did not go as planned for the remaining schools that still managed to play in semi-state. We'll begin with the boys' section of the semi-state. And that was Bethany Christian. They went to Kokomo. They took on a very strong 18-win covenant Christian team despite the fact Bethany came in as the defending state champions. They went to PKs in a scoreless regulation, scoreless overtime. And unfortunately for Bethany Christian, Covenant Christian was just a hair better in the penalty kits. They defeated Bethany 4-3 in the PKs. So Covenant Christian will represent Northern Indiana in class 1A in the state finals. And the Bethany Christian Bruins season comes to an end at 14-4-4. Just one win shy of a trip back to IU Indianapolis. For a state championship. Disappointing as it sounds right now, still a remarkable run for the Bethany Christian Bruins. And then lastly, I wanna mention the Westview Warriors. They were, they made a trip to South Bend, St. Joseph to take on Faith Christian, a very strong 16-win Faith Christian team. Again, just like the Bethany Covenant Christian Boys matchup, this matchup on the girls' side needed overtime in a scoreless tie. It looked like it may or could have went to penalty kits, but unfortunately for Westview, Faith Christian was able to get one look at the net and they converted. And that was Hannah Bolton with the match deciding semi-state clinching goal with about a minute 26 ago in the second overtime off the feed from Bailey Pati. And Faith Christian is going to the state finals. Westview, once again, one game short of their first ever trip to the state finals for girls' soccer, one worthy of note for Westview Breed Corey, stopped 18 of 19 shots, just unable to get the job done for the Westview Warriors. And so the soccer season for 2024 and around the Northeast corner comes to an end. And so that is the talk around the corner. And now we get to our interviews. I'm here with two very talented players on this Androle Girls volleyball team, Ava on the right, Maya Harris on the left of the screen here. And ladies, how are you doing this evening? Pretty good, feeling good. Yeah, I mean, we came off an exciting night yesterday. So taking the day off, but feeling really good. So. I heard you ladies had a lot of fun last night on your way back from Southwood. Yes, very, very much fun. It was a very fun bus ride. It's a lot of music being played and I'm just getting to go around the mound with everyone there supporting us. It was great. Yeah, I'm sure. Before we talk about that regional championship, I want to kind of go back to the beginning of the season. Obviously, this team has went through a lot of success over the years, especially with Morgan Gardy and Maya Ball's class coming through. And they had a lot of success as well. Couldn't get it done in the regional, but you've returned a lot back despite the fact now that your dad and the coach of the Androle program became the head coach of the Androle. Oyeball stepped down after last season, whatnot. You also still return a lot of seniors and talent back from this team. When did you realize that maybe this year was the year that maybe this team could do something that no other team at Androle has ever done before? I think we knew from the start that we would still be super good this year. And then just throughout the season, as we kept putting work in, and we saw how much everyone was determined to get better and really wanted to get further than we have in the past, it was just a turning point and how we played and how we acted as a team. And it just really helped us to get to the point where we are now. Talk about the senior classroom last year compared to this year, and how do the ladies from each of those classes have implemented and impacted the lives of you two, especially all the other players on the Androle team to make the great program that it is today? Yeah, I think the seniors from last year, obviously, it was a bigger class, but also had a few people going on for college level volleyball. But this year is mainly just basketball players, actually, plus Ava. Plus Ava. But I think they were also very motivated to want to win, and they had that drive in them, so it really pushed us to work hard. I think as the senior class, we really stepped up and took leadership. And I think the way we played and acted towards the rest of the team really changed than it has been in the past few years. Talk about the family dynamic with this program, especially with you, Maya, and then Ava playing alongside you. Ava, the majority of your assists come off of Maya Kills. Maya Kills coming off almost 99% of all those assists from Ava. Talk about that dynamic there. We played with each other for as many years that I can remember, but I guess just having that connection really kind of works the best. We know what we need from each other, and we know how to push each other to work our hardest. And it kind of just compliments each other, and it reflects off of us onto the team, and everybody just kind of works hard and wants to win. Yeah, I think being a setter and a hitter, we kind of know when each other is down or messing up and what they need to get back to where they should be. So I think that living together and just being around each other constantly, it helps that dynamic a lot. Angle is a better school, amongst the schools that ANC Sports covers in this area, but when you look at Angola in terms of dynamic with the athletes and the players provided at Angola High School, there's a lot of small school family field. And even this program, it feels tighter than ever before with this program. Talk about the connectivity and the camaraderie with this program, with the Angola community. Yeah, I think we have a lot of families, so obviously we're sisters, and then we have Kendall and Bailey Holman who are sisters. So there's a lot of family aspects in that, but also we've all played with each other since middle school and we played club together. So I think we just really came together this year and it's more of a family than it ever has been. Yeah, and I feel like this year we've worked more a lot on our team chemistry, more than we have in the past years. So it's really pushed us together and then that reflects off into how we play on the court. So just having that family act around each other, it just helps in the volleyball aspect. Quickly before we discuss the state term, I do wanna ask a curveball question here. Who's the most competitive player on the team and who's the most loose, I guess, to say? I say one of the most competitive would be Bailey. Yeah. She gets very competitive in the best ways possible, and she really gets that energy out on everyone else too to work hard and want to win. So I think she's very competitive and just has that drive in her. I would say one of the more looser players is Lexi. She obviously does wanna win a lot, but she also just has fun and she brings a lot of light to the team. And I think that's really good balance to have. Yeah, the interesting balance of personality certainly is shown with Angola over the years and whatnot. Let's talk about the state tournament, obviously the sectional that your team's always in is always the most competitive. When you bring an East Snowball into Calve now, it makes it even more competitive than ever before. You obviously took care of Bishop Dwainer in three sets, three very close sets. You beat Concordia in three close sets. Obviously, you two played a massive role in that as well. The regional, going into Southwood, long trip down there to Wabash, taking a West Sloppy. Talk about the pre-game vibes going into that matchup down in Southwood, knowing the history with going to regionals and knowing that this is one game. When does Dean, you win a regional championship? Yeah, I think we were all really excited but also nervous at the same time. We definitely wanted to kind of break the curse of not being able to win a regional. So we were all nervous, but I think on the bus ride down, we were trying to get hyped up, we were playing music and it was just a lot of exciting moments. And I think that we got our butterflies to fly in formation, whereas other people's butterflies might have just been flying around. But I think we kind of took our nerves out and used it to our advantage. Yeah, the past few weeks, in practice, not only have we been physically training, but we've also been mentally training a lot of mental performance videos and kind of just learning of how to control those butterflies and keep them in formation, which is one of the things we talked about, but also having pressure, that's a privilege. And knowing that, everyone kind of stepped up and we were able to not be as nervous and kind of reset when we needed to and just being able to be mentally tough too. And I think it helps, it's experience was your best friend going in and whatnot. Obviously West Lafayette, we've heard about their scrappiness on defense and they've had some players that are seniors that were very good this year for the West Lafayette Red Devils. You were down 0-1 that first set, fought your way back and then set four comes in, an opportunity to close set four, West Lafayette comes back. I think they scored the final three points to force the fifth set. Talk about the transition between sets four and five because for those that don't understand volleyball, volleyball is very much a momentum sport when especially going from one set to another. Talk about that transition from going from, man, we could have had set four to, let's just focus on winning set five. Yeah, I mean, set five is definitely a hard spot to be in. You never know which way it will go. And so I think our kind of way of thinking of that is the first to five. We always try to come out on top first, get that energy rolling first so we can take that momentum into the rest of the set. Yeah, definitely set five is probably the most mentally hard and physically sets to be in. It could go anyone's way, anyone could win that set, but yeah, it's just first to five and who can last the longest and work the hardest. And it's show because you jumped out to that big, that Leah, they was five, the one at one point set five, eight to three at one point then West Lafayette and the one back at the, you knew it was gonna happen. They tied it A and then you came back and you were just resilient showing that battle tested work all season long, that value amount and the quality of work that showed over the years finally paid off. Obviously you had some big plays on defense, like from players like Anna McClure and you had Kendall Holman with big kills and you had Lettsy Stolman with big kills, Ava with big time sets. And then obviously the last play of the match, Ava fittingly cross pass to Maya Harris to win the regional. Talk about that moment when you realized that this was over and Angola was a regional champion. Yeah, but I think on that last point, we kind of knew, like, okay, this is it, like we're winning this. And, you know, as a setter, I always have so many options. And I think that everyone really wanted to be the one to get the kill, which is great. But I know Maya is always just there and she's always ready to put the ball away. But yeah, I think Maya told me that one of our players, Savannah Vixler on set 14 was kind of like shaking and like getting emotional because we knew that we were about to win this. And so that's just a great feeling to have, like, we know that we have it and we're just so confident in our ability to win. Yeah, it was a great team effort. I started with a good serve from Bailey and she was able to get a great dig off it. And then Ava put up a beautiful set and then I put it away. So after like that, kind of just knew like, wow, we did it for the first time, like ever in history. And I mean, it's a great feeling and it really like really brought up our hopes and just determination to keep on going in semi-state. This is Maya and Ava Harris of Angola. Maya is a junior outside hitter. Ava Harris is a senior on this Angola team. Before we talk about semi-state, I do want to mention your future homes at the college level. Ava, you're going to Villanova next year. Maya, you're gonna have to wait an extra year. You're going in two years to Illinois in the Bay of 10. Obviously being a Purdue fan, that's kind of exciting there and whatnot. Talk about the valid reasons as to why you chose those two programs. Well, Illinois, I've always wanted to be in the Big 10. It's been a dream since I was little. So knowing that I had the opportunity, it really has me forward to choose them. But also coaching staff is great. They have a great team chemistry and they're all just one big family. And that's something that I really look forward in a college. Just knowing that for the next four years, that those are the people I'm gonna be around every day. So team and the players and the culture, that was probably my biggest drawboard. Yeah, I think for me, obviously Villanova's a great school with really good academics and it's a beautiful campus and a great spot. But I think what pushed me over the edge when deciding was when I went and visited there, the people were just so amazing. The coaches were great. The teammates were great. And I just really felt that the people there were very similar to me and I just would really fit in there. And they just gave me a great opportunity and I'm just really excited to be there next year. That is for sure. So now we move forward. And obviously this week is preparation for your team to prepare for a long road trip to Plymouth, which is over in Marshall County. You're gonna be taking on Hammond Bish of Noel in the 3A semi-state. I believe they arranged just one spot ahead of you, according to some polls in the state. While you're ranked seven, they're ranked six. Looking at the overall numbers of Bish of Noel, it seems like they do serve the ball very, very well. They're also probably scrappy just like Westloth yet. So I would imagine this is probably gonna be another long match as we would expect. And especially with this being a two-round day in semi-state because now it's being reversed to two rounds, so I'm gonna say to kind of go along with basketball, baseball, and so forth and whatnot. Talk about your early impressions with Hammond Bish of Noel and the fact you're gonna be playing a two game, potentially a two game semi-state. Well, we haven't talked much about what they are because today is our day off, but I think knowing that they're a good serving team and scrappy, that I think teams like that really push us to work our hardest so we can play up to our own level and like our highest capabilities that we know we can. So I think we just need to really just work it out and just have that mental and physical stability throughout the whole match. Yeah, they're obviously gonna be a really good team if they're in this spot. So I think we just really have to take this week to focus in, learn more about them, and really dial in ourselves as well so we can prepare to play them on Saturday. And so for those that don't know, Andy Cole will play Hammond Bish of Noel at 10 a.m. on Saturday and then the second match will feature Newcastle and Northwood, a team that you, you two ladies are familiar with for a variety of years, especially this year, beating them in five sets, their ranks, I believe they are ranks number four in class three A. So they're gonna be just as difficult if you're fortunate enough to get past Hammond Bish of Noel. So very, very exciting day, no less. My own question for me, obviously, you wanna get to the state finals in Mince, Indiana. Obviously that's the ultimate goal is playing in one of the greatest venues in all of volleyball in the state of Indiana in both states, and one at Worth and Arena. But now you're making history for the first time in the history of the program. How would science feel for the community, your family, the parents, the past players to be talking about and goal volleyball doing something that no one has ever done before? Yeah, it's great. And it's so amazing to be a part of this team that is making history and knowing that our work has paid off and the community support has just been so amazing. I mean, our match at Southwood was like an hour and a half away and we still had like a whole student section a bunch of fans there and it was just great to have everyone there cheering for us. But I think we can't put too much pressure on ourselves to get to stay and to get all the way there. And we just really have to focus on the next game and our next match. Yeah, it's a great feeling to make history for our high school. And I think everyone on our team, including all the seniors, really felt good about this win and proving to everyone that we had a chance and that we were better than some people said that we were going to be this year with losing some of our main key points. But I think it's just a great feeling to be able to prove to people that we were capable. Yeah, that's for sure. And for you, for David Harris, for seniors like Ann McClure, Bailey Holman, Lettsy Stillman, Kendall Holman. I go down the list across the order. I mean, this program, a lot of exciting moments as this school embarks history and unprecedented history, no less for female sports at Angle High School, to be this close to playing for the State Files, which Angle has never done in a team sport like volleyball or basketball or football. So it definitely is a signing time, no less, to be a part of that opportunity. Maya, Ava, any final thoughts before I let you go? Nope. Thank you so much. Thank you for having us. All right, that is Maya and Ava Harris of the Angle Lady Hornets as they prepare on historic first semestates as they will take on Handish of Noel at Plymouth High School. Ladies, thank you for taking the time to talk about the Hornets. And good luck this week. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm here with the head football coach of the Prairie Heights Panthers, Pat McCrae. Coach, how are things going for you and your parents? Doing really good. Thanks, Sam. All right, coach, before we talk about this season, I do want to talk about your time at Prairie Heights over the years. This is your ninth season at Prairie Heights. And when you first came in, this is the program that went through a lot of struggle. I think they were winless at that time and went through a little bit of a losing streak at that point. Coach, when you look back between when you first came in as a head football coach to now, where have you seen the most improvement with the program, especially with the way it is handled with the community aspects of Prairie Heights football? Well, as far as the community, the Prairie Heights community has always been great in supporting us and our team, even when we've had some really struggled years. They've always been there in supporting us. But the kids, our kids are always blue collar, hardworking kids. And this year, it's just been really fortunate to have a big group of seniors. We have 16 seniors this year. So in high school football, especially in small school football, it's a numbers game. And when you have a lot of kids, that helps tremendously. That is for sure. Going into this season, obviously, this last season for Prairie Heights in 2023, your team was winless. But it seemed like the program was showing a lot of fights still. And it seemed like a young team was going to eventually improve going into this season. Talk about the excitement about this year's Prairie Heights Panthers. I think it really left off with last year. We went into sectionals 0 and 9 and went into central Louisville. They beat us in the regular season last year. I think it was 55 to nothing. And we went into that game last year. And we ended up losing 14 to nothing. But hats off to our seniors that we had last year. I think that the hard work and determination of them guys is sticking through it with the season. I think that helped to bleed over into this year and help get our kids started off on a good foot. And we brought in extra kids who didn't play last year from that senior class. And that's really helped a lot. And a good group of kids this year, we started off the season with roster of 50 kids. And in my tenure at Prairie Heights, that's been the most kids we've ever had on roster. So ended that season last year. Wasn't what we wanted, what we hoped for last year. But I think that group of boys who played last year helped build on what we're doing. And any time you get 50 kids at Prairie Heights for football, that's a huge deal. I remember the days when it used to be maybe getting 30 kids at Prairie Heights was seen as like that was a big deal. So getting 50 was just that's a tremendous accomplishment for your program at Prairie Heights. Obviously, you started the season with a win over WITCO. I believe it was like 56 to 14 at WITCO. And that was a game where Jordan clubs set the record, I believe, for receptions, I believe, in a game against WITCO and whatnot. And it really was just the beginning of something that was something we have not seen in Prairie Heights in quite some time, especially with the 3-in-1 start. You had Klump on that team. You have other kids on that team as well. Obviously, we'll talk about Matt Armstrong in a matter of moments. But just talk about the team's resilience and then their depth throughout the lineup where at any given point, any of these players could come up with a big play. Yeah, that's been a big thing, especially, like I said, being a small school and having good numbers like that, that really helps because we've had kids who maybe for a week or so have been injured. We've been able to move other guys in and not necessarily freshman. In the past, we've had low numbers. And you get one or two guys hurt. And then all of a sudden, it seems like you're starting a bunch of freshmen to fill in. And this year, that being that we've had more kids on our roster than ever before since I've been coaching, that's been a huge benefit. When you've had a kid injured, we don't have to backfill with freshmen. And some guys that have stepped up this year, and then it's just been amazing. Connor Syesmore, he's a sophomore, started off at the beginning of the year. He was injured. He didn't play the Wickel game. I don't believe he played week two either against Bronson. And then Connor has just steadily worked his way up and gotten better and better each week. So that's been a really good thing for us. And then when you look at the lineup with Prairie Hides, obviously you have some multi-sport athletes on this team that are experienced, especially in wrestling. One of the top sports at Prairie Hides is wrestling. So you have the Hagewood kids that play both ways. That's a huge deal, Prairie Hides, because you always have to play both ways on this team. And then you've got, obviously, we talked about Matt Armstrong, a dual-thread quarterback who can run and throw the football. He obviously recently set the program for career passing yards at Prairie Hides, which I believe was previously set by Ethan Hoover just a few years ago at Prairie Hides. So talk about Matt Armstrong's growth over the years at quarterback that has helped him become who he is. And he's only a junior, by the way. So we did one more year talking about Matt Armstrong at quarterback. Yeah, I think it was his freshman year. His first start was against Chere Busco. And that probably couldn't have been a worse situation for him to step into as a starting quarterback. That was not one of his best games by far as a quarterback at Prairie Hides. But at that time, we felt like, hey, we were going to give Matt a shot and see where things could take us. And you're right. Matt is a dual-thread quarterback. His rushing yards, I think right now, second on the team in rushing yardage this season. And I think getting those early starts as a freshman has helped him out a lot as he's progressed through last year and this year. And I think there's a lot left on the horizon for him. Mm-hmm. That is for sure. Let's go ahead and shift towards the sectional game. Obviously, after going three and one, you had a little bit of a losing streak. Then the big wing against Fremont happened in week A. You get some momentum going into sectionals. You drew central noble in the first round. A team you beat in the regular season this year, back in week number four. You beat central noble 26 to 14. And again, talking about the common theme of Prairie Hides, Matt Armstrong does what he does best throwing the football and running the ball. You got a balanced rushing attack led by the Hagewood kids. You got some receivers at Bound that collectively get their targets and whatnot. But then on defense, you're making the plays, whether it's Walker McCray, whether it's the Morgan kid who had three sats against a really talented quarterback in Brodie Morgan of central noble who, I believe, threw for 265 yards and set the central noble program record for completion and whatnot. Talk about the ability to get that win on the road against a central noble team that was hungry for a win. And knowing this was going to be the last game for some of these teams at central noble, how do you be able to come out and gun out that win against central noble? Well, I think that just goes back to a little bit of history. I told the kids last week, even though we beat central noble like we did in week four, I told them at the start of last week, I said, guys, I said, don't expect central noble to come out and lay down for us. I said, those kids are going to come out, they're going to fight you. And I said, just like last year, we went into that sectional one game last year, 0-9, after central noble beat us in the regular season, 55-0. And our kids went out there and fought to the nail every play. We ended up losing that game, 14-0. And that was like the whole thing I stressed to them last week was do not count these guys out. They are going to come out and fight you. And my message to the team last Friday night was, we got 48 minutes to go out and earn a shot at another 48 minutes. And I wanted them to empty their tanks. So, and I felt like our kids did that. They went out and they fought back just as hard as central noble did, fought harder and empty their tank. And we earned another 48 minutes next week. That is for sure. As you looked at Prairie Heights football, that was the 11th postseason win in the history of the program. So that's, that makes it a little bit more special for the program. You reach five wins for the first time since 2013. And only, I believe it's the third time since 1989. And I know people are getting tired of hearing that year at Prairie Heights football. This is a big deal for this program, going in the right direction. Now you have an opportunity to get a six win. Something that hasn't happened at Prairie Heights since 1986. You're going to play east side. You're going to be a home in front of your very loyal home crowd at Prairie Heights. You're going to be hosting east side team that beat you by 13 points in the regular season. When you talk about the matchup at the east side, and obviously it's going to be harder for east side to win that second game because of how hard it is to beat the same team twice. Talked about the matchup at the east side up front. Talked about that matchup knowing you're not to face Joe Richmond at quarterback. And then talked about what are things that your team is going to have to continue to do well to have an opportunity to win this game. Yeah, excuse me. You know, excuse me. East side is going to be east side. They're a really good football team. They've traditionally been a really good football team. And you know, our kids are just going to have to work hard. And if we want to win this game, we're going to have to be willing to work harder and them guys and fight harder. It doesn't matter to me who they got at quarterback. I know that they're going to be the same east side team. They like to run the football. They're quarterbacks, no matter who it is. Have always been really good at running the football. And they're just, they're tough kids and they're tough to be. And you know, I don't expect anything less from them than we've seen in them in the past. And Coach Brandiwe's done a good job picking up, you know, that program and moving forward. And you know, we're excited to play them guys at home and looking forward to a good game this Friday. So I guess we should be forecasting some hard-nosed football on Friday, aren't we? Yeah, I'm pretty sure east side's going to want to run the football, that's for sure. Yeah, that's for sure. Final question from me, Coach. Obviously, you're kind of a Prairie Heights guy and this community has embraced you and your family within the Prairie Heights football program. The feeder system has been a big part of Prairie Heights' growth over the years. Just talk about how appreciated that you feel about being a part of the Prairie Heights family. A very small community that feels like it's a big family over there and brushy prairie and whatnot. That blue color feel of Prairie Heights has always resonated with the Prairie Heights community. Just talk about how much do you appreciate being a part of that Prairie Heights culture? Oh man, that means everything to me. You know, that's where I grew up. I remember watching guys when I was a little kid. My dad was a local farmer. When I was in kindergarten, first grade, a lot of the football players used to bail hay from my dad and just growing up watching Prairie Heights football. And then as I came up through the program, man, I just love our community and being a part of it. When lose or whatever, we always have really great fans who are there supporting us and just wanting our kids to do the best. And I love Prairie Heights and brushy prairie. I mean, that's a badge of honor for guys like me and kids at our school. We are brushy prairie. That is for sure. And your community embraces that for sure. This is Patrick McCray, the head football coach of the Prairie Heights Panthers as they get sent, take on the Eastside Blazers in the sectional semifinals. Coach, any final thoughts before we let you go? No, just want to say thanks to guys like you and everybody else in our area and the media who promotes high school football. All right, coach.
