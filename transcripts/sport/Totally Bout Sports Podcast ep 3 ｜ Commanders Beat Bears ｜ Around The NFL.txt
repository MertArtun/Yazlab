 Yo, welcome to the totally bout sports podcast on the second win sports media network. It's your boy sees a fantastic alongside. You know who you hear with your boy Reggie. Hey, you already know. Hey, had a good win today, bro. Good win. Good, good game. Good game with a good win. And it's got one thing to say to the people. Man, yeah, who we thought they were, bro. And what we thought they were, man, a good defense. Good team, man. Good defense, good team. Caleb. Good quarterback. You know what I'm saying? Just all around, you know, good team, bro. But, you know, like we said, we just thought we was better. You know what I'm saying? And throughout the whole game, we showed we a better team. You know what I'm saying? And down to how it came down to. But, you know, it is what it is. You know, you got to win the way you win. You know what I'm saying? What you think about the game, bro? Like you said, good win. They always thought they were they defense. Surprised me, even though we were supposed to score a little bit more points than what we scored. Penalties held us back. Couple drop passes held us back. But they defense still stopped us a couple of times, forced punts. But our defense too. We say it all the time, Frankie Louvre. Frankie Louvre. Hey, he had me and this is trying to talk about, watch out. Watch out. Watch out. What my dog said? What my dog said? Yeah. As you're in a bucket. I was in that joint. I was in here going off, bro. Yeah, Frankie Louvre showed out Wagner, too. You know what I'm saying? We keep going. I think I think it just came to a point where they got that one. That like I say, that's Swift one. That that that got us. And then that that third and fourth answers that we didn't go for when Jaden, he was down an inch before the first down and it gave a good feel for this. To get that last one. I small scale think he got that for real. Like I was like, I got that. That was always Lord. Oh, I think I think that hurt score. I think he scored that touchdown. Yeah. They called that. Yeah, it was a few little joints that I was like, oh, come on, man. You know, but that's what it is. You get over there having it up, playing with J. And honey, ours again. Hey, 100 hours again, you know, defensively, I want to give a big shout out to Johnny Newton, bro. He stepped in. He stepped up that day. Like he showed why he was should have been the first round up. But thanks. I thought he stepped up. The whole defense stepped up, you know. Secondary most of the game, you know what I'm saying? Mine is that St. Juice penalty at the end, which I was like, like I said, I felt like it wasn't a catchable pass, but he did grab him a little. You know, he was more so the route that made him grab him. It was a vicious route. Keenan, yeah, yeah, I was. Oh, I would. Yeah, I would. I'm mad at it. You know, I'm mad at it. But overall, good one. We needed it. And the train keep on rolling. We never we down. Yeah, it's a needed it, but we didn't. We it's no way we should have been. We could have lost. We should have lost that game. It's like, you know what I'm saying? Even like Romo and then was like, we sitting here at the end of the game and Chicago might walk away with this game and they've been outplayed the whole game like, you know what I'm saying? We outplayed them the whole game. But but we outplayed them. But we couldn't get an end zone like the yacht was. I think it was like he had thirty nine passing yards to J. And like 200 and it was only nine to zero nine to nothing. Right. It's like, all right. All right, like we playing with food right now. Yeah, yeah. That's how we need. We needed we needed to get a touchdown early in the game. Probably first, second court. I said, it's going to be a race to 20. I knew we will hold them under 20. And I'm like, we got to probably get about 20. You know what I'm saying? This is a race to 20. Whoever get 20, win the game. And I wasn't even thinking about that. I was like, if we if we could have scored. If we would have made that field goal that on the wild on the field goal that it was a shame. He just shanked it. Yeah. If we would have made that, I felt like the game was over. If we could have got one more score, of course, before the Hail Mary, I felt like the game was over and was over. But we couldn't get the score and we couldn't get a first down to it. When we punted, we giving them good field position. Yeah, that's a key. Enough field position for one or two first downs kind of like put you in close to the red zone. I think I think it would have got a touchdown on that. It's the keyest joint. You know, they're not on that play, you know, that would have. That would have pushed us to what 13 nothing and that could have changed the whole game plan for them. But because then, you know, they wouldn't have been able to hit. They would never. Yeah. God, they were still able. They were still able to run the ball and do everything that one touchdown. That's out the door. You know, you ain't handed it to Swiss no more. Yeah. And it's going to be up to what it's on Caleb. It's on Caleb. And at that point, Caleb, he he didn't have confidence in his own offense. What? The whole day. Yeah. Yeah. It was like, I can't do nothing. Pastries. All over his face. Mm hmm. I can't. I can't move. He I can't do nothing. I'm tired. He tried nothing. One thing I will say, Caleb got a little more dog in him than I thought, you know, because they was they was they was they was cracking them. They was hitting them. They was hitting. They was hitting them all around and he kept he kept fighting. He kept fighting. So I give Caleb that credit as far as to me, to me, he was fighting because the defense kept you in it. Now, any moment and point in time, that defense would have gave up 714. They would have went behind the eight ball. I think it would have been different. But you see your defense out there fighting and fighting. And it's like, I could just get a touchdown. Those three right here, we back in the game. He not never he not never completely depleted because of the defense making plays or us not making plays or whatever the case may have been. Now, I say we started out the game. Beeprod. Yeah. Early in the game, Beeprod was cooking, you know, then the bears, you know, they adjusted or whatever and started to load the box up and shut Beeprod down and it was, you know, put the game more on Jaden's arm. But. You think Jaden was the same as far as what we seen previously. Yeah. And I know, like even, I think Tony Rowan was saying, the velocity of his passes. It was some pretty good passes was dropped. It was it was a lot of drops, but that one, the Zach Erz across the middle that came up a little short, might have had something to do with that. It was it was a couple. It was a couple of times where I'm like, even the go for it at the end of like, they're really pushed for it for at the end of the first half, you know? It was like, I think, you know, they don't want them. They don't want to risk them too much. You know, it was a few times where I was like, you know, so I did think he was faking, I think he was faking. I think he was faking the fact that he was OK, because he looked even when he took the couple hits, it was like he didn't have no reaction on his face. But he got hit one time and he was like, I saw early, you know, they ran them, they ran them early, which. I can't be too mad at if they felt like, you know, he he was he was he healthy, you know what I'm saying? So they ran them early and I was like, and I saw as soon as he jumped out the outside and he grabbed, it was like an immediate reaction to grab at his rib. I'm like, hold up, Jayden. Now, you know, don't do too much. You know what I'm saying? But yeah, Jayden, I mean, I can't say. That it was too bad because he ended up twenty one for thirty eight for three hundred twenty six. I think that's the most you ask me through for on the season. I think he was good. But I think I think that. Just his running threat in the red zone. That's what opens up the red zone more for us. And I don't think that that running threat was there as much, you know, so they didn't want to use it as much today, which is understandable, you know. Yeah, yeah. I think that could have been the case. Or every time we get down there, we get a penalty that put us back five yards having many yards and then it changed the play. It changed the scenario. It changed what we wanted to do now. We really can't do that. We have to do something else. You know, I said again, I just wish Currie Terry had that breakaway. Another one. Look, I say, man, first thing I thought about was very rich. I said, my God, I said, come on, you got to make me write something. I said, you see, you see, Jay, you see, Jayden, when the dude came in his ankles. Yeah, yeah. Jumped up out of that joint, right? I said, come on, Terry, man, you got to come on. You got to you got to figure out a way. I don't care if you stumble. But it's every time like you see it a lot today. You see it a lot today when Currie Terry come back on them, come back or come across the middle, he catch it and he go down. Mm hmm. And I'm like, listen, baby, it's time to be a playmaker. It's time to it's time to listen. It's time to one, two, one, two moves and try to try to take it. So he he he he he got hands. But I just want that that extra from him. Maybe if he gives us that extra, then we won't need that number two. We need number two. I would need number two. We need number two. But the little know man is being our number two right now. Salute to Noah, but he had some key drops today that that that that that store drives to man. I'm like, oh, come on. He had like two drops that we needed. We really needed them passes. And at that time I was like. Man, see, this is why we need to get Cooper, man. This is why we need to get Cooper. But yeah, salute to Noah for for saving grace with that. He'll like games like this, though. It's like I say, and I've been saying it when in week one. It's showing our turnaround. Like I say, like I say about the chief, the chief know how to win almost any type of scenario in the in the football game. They know how to win if they throw no touchdowns, get penalties. My home so full picks, even though that would never probably happen. But you know, they know how to win. They know how to just come out with a W. And that's what we did today. We had penalties. We had drops. I like the frustration on Jay. And Jay was was frustrated a lot because we call it early timeouts. Yeah, that's another thing. Killed this in the second half. Yeah, we call it early timeouts. And Jay and you see it on his face. And I'm like, play through it. It's time to play through it. It's time to play through it. And when they score, I'm like, we got to play through it. Play through it. Grant, this is the first time with that. First time I seen Jayton do that, too, like as far as show visible frustration, because that wasn't the first time it happened on that. That wasn't the first time it happened. And he was mad the first time it happened. But then when it happened again, he like, all right now, I'm going to say, you know what blew me? I don't I mean, they're going to have to do something with this rule, right? The substitution rule. Yeah, no, how they had the substitution when when you substitute on offense. But they call the false thought on us. And they call the false thought, but the ref, the refs wasn't even set. So the play can't go off like the refs not set. How you going? You know what I'm saying? And then I seen times when the refs get out the way, it's three seconds on the clock on the play clock. You know what I'm saying? So it's like it gets to a point where it's like, OK, at 10 seconds, you know what I'm saying? If y'all ain't served yet, then y'all just going, it's going to be where it's going to be. You know, that might have to be like the new rules. Because that that rule is really given the defense too much power to control the time on the offense. So that job like the job like been blowing me a past couple of weeks for real. I'm like, yeah. They go, they I think they're going to see it. They going to try to, you know, tweak it around. Come next year. Yeah. Competition committee and get in get involved on that. And there. But a man that in the office. J.M. versus Caleb. Yeah. I was I was going to go. Hey. I mean, it is what it is, you know? It is what it is. One one through for three, but three twenty six, the other one through for one thirty one, ten for twenty four for one thirty one. And really, really that one. One hundred a damn day, a hundred. What a hundred like ninety seven ninety nine. Ninety nine yards of that came in the fourth life. You know what I'm saying? When they was fighting to get, you know, get back in and take on and take the lead. So. Yeah, I mean, it's visible. Kaley, Caleb looked off. You know, he looked all four game. He looked he looked erratic. He didn't have to look all season. Basically, this Chicago Bears game was a Chicago Bears game. How they've been playing all season defense. Like defense, a special team. And they defense gave Caleb an extra win in that last quarter, the last couple of drives to where all Caleb need is one or two drives a game. Good drives. But you know, you run up to a team like you run up to the day. Then you're going to need more than one or two. I need one. One. Yeah, I think that. Think the football guys was looking down on us day, bro. Like we deserved it. Like, yeah, y'all are played up, man. We can't. We can't. We can't have this. This can't happen, bro. It can't. It can't. It can't. We want them to do a park has one week. Hey, I mean, I'm a show. I'm a show, bro. Like, you know, I'm when lose, like, you know, we got show like, but it would have been it would have been it would have been sad. Man, it would have been this one would have been this one would have hurt, man. He's now you you hold Chicago to two for two for twelve on third downs. They couldn't do nothing. They couldn't do absolutely nothing. You know, they get Caleb thrown it to the fans. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it was it was it was. Through three quarters. We probably should have. It should have been like 28. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? It should have been like 28. Easily. Easy. The first drive, be Rob got us down there. Stardust three. Scurry, Terry got the bomb. Stardust three. Like every time. But you know, well, we need to work on, though. Soon as he hit that sweep, I said, man, we struggle so bad with sweeps. Yeah, we always struggle with sweeps, jet sweeps, any kind of sweep, bro. I'm like, yeah. Well, like we struggle with them joints. You know what we need, though? I'm going to tell you, like I said, I said last year, we shouldn't never get rid of sweat. Mark, he fast. Hey, slam, you see the you see how much of a difference maker that man is, bro? He's fast. And I knew he was fast with us. But it's like he picked up some side. He ain't. But he ain't lose the speed. And I think it's a prize, J. Because J. And honestly thought he could outrun him on the edge. Two times that he caught. He caught. He probably was like, you you fast. Yeah, you fast. Why we get rid of you? Why we get rid of you? That's what I said. I said at that time, man, I'm like, bro, I would trade. I'm fine with getting rid of Chase at this point, whatever, you know, I wanted to keep one of them to though. And I was like, I want to keep sweat, but Salute to sweat. Man, he's still balling. Would you trade sweat for one of those detacles we got? Yeah. Which one? Because we we three deep. We three deep. Let me let me reference the question. Because sweat is only going to be worth two of those. And it's even the wrong pain of Jonathan. Yeah. Yeah. Would you trade one of those two to make it? Because I think I think I think Johnny could hold down the other one. OK. You know what I'm saying? Johnny, Johnny showed the data he could, you know what I'm saying? He could he could do this. So yeah, I would. And even without Johnny with Ridgeway, it was like. I still want to talk about. We have to have that edge. Yeah. We got to have that edge, Russia, that that that that. That bona fide past Russia. That's why I'm willing to trade up to a second round the full one right now at this point, you know. Because that that that takes so much pressure off your secondary. If you know you got a weak secondary, you know what I'm saying? It take a little bit of pressure off of them, knowing that. We're going to be able to get there. You know what I'm saying? We are secondary because the past couple games, I honestly don't think they garbage me personally. I think we average in the back. You know what I'm saying? I don't think we don't have no game changes. We don't got no pure shutdowns. But I think they're all good at what they do. It's been arguing playing. I think it is what I do. See, it's. Yeah, and that's what it is. And that's that's what I was about to say. As much as I kind of got a love, hate relationship. For Benji, St. Juice, I feel like if we can get a playmaker in his back. And keep everything else in place. I feel like that changes our secondary. Yeah, but see, I think St. Juices with St. Juices, I say that is saying like he not a bull. He might get got a couple of times. You know what I'm saying? He might get got. But for the most part, he going to give you decent coverage. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? He going to be right in this. To me, he is when he get beat and when he feel out of place, he get handsy and we get penalties. Yeah, yeah, you get hands. And that's what I'm like, like even these days, more was crying because he was shutting, shutting them down for for the game. But it was one player saying if he got handsy with him, but Caleb got rid of the ball and completed it too fast. And if he would have waited, I felt like they would have got the call. But because he threw the ball so quickly, it was kind of like simultaneously where I don't let that go. But he played good. He played good. I think I think he's a he's a he's a all right corner. I'm going to say he great. He not a pro bowler, nothing crazy, but I think he's all right. I think we got all right up front and make him look better. It'll make him better. You get a little pass rush that'll help him. But, you know, me, I want to go for both. I want one each, you know what I'm saying? But, you know, you can't I don't want to trade everything. Yeah. Now, you know, I I was pegging this game as the as the breakout for my man, Forbes, you know, he can't get out there. And I was like, and that's another thing what I realized what we do is just like some days, some players going to play there and some days. You know, yeah, that's what they say. They say, like, you know, if they they they set people up for his compared to the matchup, you know, they maybe they thought that these receivers, they wasn't and I see what it is, you know, they saw which is smart. They didn't play much zone. Yeah. They they they they rushed a lot to get the Kayla. May Caleb Russia made him have to just get the ball up by his hands, which was smart. I mean, right game. They. So what's the sex we get today? Um, sex, I think we got like two. I think we only got two. Yeah, two. But there was a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure. But that's Caleb was just a magician back there, bro. I was like, oh, oh, they got it. No, how you get out of that? You know, Caleb got out of a lot back there, man. He got out of one of them. He couldn't get away when he went one on one with Frankie. You remember that? Court of an awesome. Frankie said, yeah. Get away from that one. To my man down like, yeah, but Caleb, he's he more lucid in that pocket than I thought he was, man. I was like, you know, I knew he could move around it, but I know I know his awareness, his pocket awareness was like that, like that, you know, I call him more fear. Then awareness because he was running for his life. He was. He was running for his life. But we couldn't get him. But like you say, a hundred of them, you all came in the fourth quarter. No, so you weren't really completing nothing. Oh, no, he was. He couldn't do nothing. I think he was looking at the pressure come most of the first half. Like where's coming from this time? You know, let me see how I'm how I'm going to get out of here. You know, because he knew it was coming. And I mean, to hold them out. I don't know how many first downs they got early, but you know, they went on them two drives late in the fourth quarter, basically. And we held them the 15th first. DeAndre Swift. Man, you got that one. You go to me, you said, man, DeAndre Swift, you know, he he got. Look, that's all you got to look for. Because I. I said. Yeah, you good. I'm here in the. Little music that you play. But it's cool. Oh, oh, oh, yeah. So. What was you saying about Swift? Oh, no, no, no, just like I said, we had to had to watch out for. And, uh, but that's he had a good game. I had to have to switch. The yeah, yeah, Swift was Swift was cooking, Swift was cooking. Yeah, that it was it was mainly that run, though. It was a lot to do with that run. Um. And our defense, like, I don't know what it I think. We was more focused on stopping that pass, maybe with Caleb. And getting pressure on him that we wasn't really as focused on the run game. You know. Yeah, I don't know. I'm. Just think Swift was nobody had to do. He got got through. He got through. Got through with us and had that long run. Man. But yeah, I want to go around the league, though. Do want to go around the league real quick. All right. And talk about. Talk about some of these other games that went on. First, I want to talk about them, them dolphins. You know, two came back today. And. They played against the Cardinals, right? Played against the Cardinals. Calamari went off 26 for 36 for 307 with two touchdowns and two ahead was 28 for 38 to 34 with one. But really want to talk about tour with this one, because the dolphins, they jumped out to a lead. And then the cardinals came back. But do you think tour is that much of like a difference maker for them? Like, because they look they look a lot better today. He is a hell of a difference maker for. They lost in the losing effort he played. They looked completely better. Yeah, completely better. Running game was bad. I mean, yes, eight chain had 100 on the ground, 60 through the air. How we had about six for seventy through the air. So a lot of players who wasn't getting involved without them started to get involved. Yeah, he opened that offense up, man, like I was saying last week, man. I don't think he all that. I think he probably, like I said, probably. Fringe top 10 in a league or whatever. But in that system. It just works with him like nothing nobody business. But he might have made me rethink that the way. Just the difference, the difference that he makes with them. And, you know, I might have to revisit that because, man, they looked dead in the water most of the year, you know, since he's been out. And now they actually look like they. They ain't that bad. Yes, they look. And they lose the effort. You know, they lose the effort. I ain't looked that bad. Facts. But the Baltimore. How about the next thing I was going to say, Baltimore in the Browns, man. Baltimore lost to the Browns 24 to nine. Um, Lamar Jackson had two eighty nine with two touchdowns. Jamis Winston started for Cleveland and really got their offense going more than this been all year. It went 27 for 41 for three thirty four. They also got new play calling new play calling. Do you name it? That's right. Jamis difference. It's different. Jamis Winston. You give me? Yeah, yeah. You give me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, Jamis Winston for the Browns. Uh huh. He I could tell by his pregame speech that they was coming out to do something. He went eating no dub used by you when eating dubs. Yeah, nah, he he had him looking better, man. He had him looking real good. Um, think the team rally behind him because he's somebody who's going to push you down the field. I don't know what's been going on with the Sean. I don't know if the team just gave up on him for real or whatever. What? But they look like they was really out there fighting for Jamis. Um, in Baltimore. Oh. They had it. Should have been that game. Should have. Yeah. Kyle Hamilton had an interception. Jamis over through the dude and Kyle Hamilton had to pick right there in his bread basket and dropped it next play touchdown. And, um, really just didn't get bored of more time to, you know, get downfield, man. But, um, yeah, Cleveland look a lot better. I'm think I was sort of rooting. I was sort of rooting against Cleveland because. I want them to hurry up and go in and get that fire sale so we could get Denzel Ward or. You know what I'm saying? So I'm like, I'm wanting to go ahead and go ahead and hurry up and get them folks up out of here, man, because we all, you know, they need to come to this real good situation, man. Um, in the division, only division game from early is, uh, Eagles, Eagles and Bengals, man. How you would think about the Eagles? Like I, like I believe I always feel like it's hard to stop a team that has a running quarterback. And when you add that, as they call him, Barkley on top of that 22 for one 08 was safe. Why? And then of course, no, Jalen score three, three, I'm one. Three. Yeah. Yeah. I think he wanted to, he wanted to say, why I got him down there. He wanted to get, let's say, why I get it. But you know, they, they, the brotherly shove Kings man. So that's what they went with. Yeah. Yeah. And borough was 26 for 37. 234 one touchdown, one pick. And, um, yeah, Jamar Chase, he had nine, nine catches, but only 54 yards. Yeah. What, what, let me ask you, what do you think about the Eagles? Cause I said in the last week, how sneaky I think the Eagles are. I'm, I'm sort of, I'm sort of worried. Yeah. Cause they, they sitting right here, they sitting right here on our heels. It's like, and do you know before we did what we did today with the hell Murray? I'm like, man, we about to give up number one. Yeah. We about to, yeah. I think we still would have had it by half a game. I think. Yeah. Well, because now we both got two. So that would have been our third one. Oh yeah. Yeah. So we would have, I do not want to be behind them because they would have had it because how they, they game, they, they game style. They, they run the ball, they quank and get them down there. And when they down in that red zone, they probably the hardest team in the NFL to start. Yeah. I was, I was thinking for as much crap as they put like Serrani, you know, they. Sort of wanting to fire him every week. You know, he keep keeping them in contention. You know what I'm saying? No, for sure. Like, I'm like, how Joe? Y'all doing this, man? But shouldn't have let them get safe one. I know that much because. Safe one, having a whole resurgence to his career. Like he's showing out up there, man. Yeah, he's showing out. He's showing out, man. And then now they got AJ Brown back. Devonte Smith, Devonte Smith finally, like, you know, he had a bad, he had it down a couple of weeks, but he showed out today. Yeah, I can't say nothing about it, man. Salute to now, man. That's gonna be, we're gonna, that's gonna be a battle, bro. That's gonna be a battle, man. Yeah. But listen, we got, we got, we got to John's next week. So take care of business right there. And we go to Pittsburgh. But listen, let me, let me, let me shoot out this stat line for you, right? Uh huh. And I'm gonna tell you this stat line and I want you to tell me what you think the final score was in a win or in a loss. 12 for 15, 85 passing yards. Do you think that quarterback won or do you think that quarterback lost? 12 for 15. 85 with a head to be lost though, but I mean. No, you asked. I know you asked for reasons. That quarterback, that quarterback won 52 to 14. There you go. That's crazy. That's crazy. He had three touchdowns, but yeah, had three touchdowns. 15, 85 yards. There, that was all for what? Jermid Gibbs, David Montgomery. I think they ran back a special team's kick or punt kicks. They's listening. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Khalifa Raymond with a 90 yard punt, punt return. Yeah. Yeah. All short passes. The Porter for three yard pass touchdown, same round for one yard joint. Rock right for eight. Good gracious. Y'all said last day, they ballin'. No, they didn't. They're bad at the NFC. You too? Look, because you know, they got a nice, they got good defense. To go on top of being able to only throw for 85 yards. That's ridiculous. Yeah. Nah, they, they, they clicking on all cylinders, bro. They clicking on all cylinders, man. Defense got two picks on Mason Rudolph today. Rudolph went 22 for 38 for 266. But man, Tennessee, one of them teams. They one of them teams looking for one of these footer backs. Number one, number one drive pick. Fighting for one of these. Yeah. This number one pick. Try to get a quarterback even like I say, like I said before, not sold on none of these quarterbacks this year coming out. If I was a team, I just start taking for, for arch or something, you know, try to get that man in blood line. We just going to be garbage next year too. We going to be garbage next year too. Cause yeah, that's, but yeah, man. So who else was earlier you had? Yeah, the Jets. The Jets. Jets who can't get right. Jets can't get right. I know Devonte Adams is hurt, bro. Like Devonte Adams is hurt. He, he done left one situation to go to another situation and it's just like he can't get to a good situation to save his life. That's exactly what it is, the situation. Yeah, it's bad. It alludes to the Patriots. When Drake may went out with a head injury, Brissette came in, went 15 for 24, 132. And Rogers there goes 17 for 28 for 233. Yeah. But the Patriots came in though, won in the game. And he came in and won in the game, man. Sort of worried. I'm sort of filled for Brissette, man. He keep getting these situations. And doing good. Well, he like, you know, he looked like he should be the starter. You know what I'm saying? Like he prized, you know, he better than Drake. Like, you know, he did start the year as the starter and they wasn't like that. So it ain't, I ain't, can't be too mad. But yeah, he better than Drake may at this point right now. You know, they, it's just one of those situations where I mean Joe Flacco coming for the coach and look like he better than Anthony Richardson at times. So he is better than, he is better than Anthony Richardson. So I mean, hey, I don't know. Maybe they just want to develop. Yeah. They want to develop Drake and I get it because, you know, they not looking to be world leaders right now. But yeah. So it's like, you know, get Drake Mason some time. And but Drake may have sold raw to me. That's why I didn't like him coming out the draft because I didn't like his teeth. He got that. He got talent. The arm is ridiculous. You know what I'm saying? But I didn't like his tape. I didn't like his decision making. I didn't like his progression. I didn't like, there's a lot of things I didn't like about Drake, which is why I was like, I ain't Drake probably be my fifth quarterback that I would. He was probably fifth for me. And it was probably only fifth because wouldn't I probably would have had him over both next deal. So he's probably fifth. Do you think if the best and go back, would they drag, would they still draft Caleb number one? High side, 2020, no. I don't think so. I think they, I think they know right now at this point, Jayton's better. Not saying in a future Caleb can't get, you know what I'm saying? Yes. So it's like, but I think for the situation that the Bears was in with their coach, you can look at their coach, their GM, they're, they, they damn they lame ducks. You know what I'm saying? They, they went all in to win now. They put all the pressure on Caleb to win right now. And Caleb is not prepared for that right now. Yeah. Four or five years from now, Caleb might be the next pack my homes. You know what I'm saying? But to put that on him right now, no, he's not prepared for that. That's more of a situation where Jayton was more prepared for. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Jayton was more to work on with Caleb than what you got to work on with Jayton. Yeah. Jayton was more to be put in a situation where you, okay, we, we ready to push. You can look at our situation. We wasn't ready to push. He made us. Yeah. He put us there. Nah, we ready to go right now. What you mean? Nah, Jayton. So look, this is what we're going to do. You know, we might be, we might be a little bad this year. We might win about six, seven games. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. All right. Jayton's six, seven. When we're six, seven, we gain. Six, seven what? Six, seven by we gain. Let me ask you this because it's just another player who I didn't see on the field today. Just going back to the Eagles game is Jehan Doxon. I saw. I saw him on the sideline when they, they had a play, you know, he came out was like, yeah, good play. I was like, oh, there you go. Hey, what's up? Just, just, just got you playing up there, bro. Do you think it could have worked out here with him? He would have been. Nah, I don't, I don't because the play style is not Jehan's play style. You know what I'm saying? Like they want dogs, like they want. You're going to have to block. You're going to have to crash into the pile. You're going to have to, you know what I'm saying? You're going to have to be physical. You're going to have to run like you got to Tasmanian double some stuff. You know what I'm saying? And Jehan more of a finesse, pretty game. I would run this little slick route. You know what I'm saying? He more of that type. They don't want that. That ain't going to work. Yeah. Nah, they don't want that. Nah, they don't want that. They want AJ Brown and Debo Sandals. Yeah. I want AJ Brown or Debo Sandals. Bad. 49ers keep losing. Maybe, maybe we slip up with somebody. Yeah, they got to make some money for Brock, don't they? They got to. They almost got to. They got to free up some money from Brock from somewhere. They got to pay Brock because if they don't pay Brock, I'm a quarterback. I don't want to go to the San Francisco. What I got to do to get paid. Yeah. Salute to the people on NBC like the Ujjaka. Halftime, they got Hail Mary to the command. Hail Mary to the command. I'm surprised. I'm surprised I still got a voice after saying that. Hey, sometimes I was curking out so bad. I'm like, yeah, my name is mad at me right now. They was curting. I didn't say so much stuff, Joe. I think I called everybody in my contact book. Why nobody answered me? Everybody was probably, they probably hit him in the nose. They was screaming. The one person who answered was the Eagles fan. I'm like, sorry, but you got to hit this. You got to hit this one too, J. You got to hit this. Hey, so your man bounced back after last week's bad game. CJ. CJ. You said who? CJ Stroud. They struggled. They struggled. 25 for 27 for 285. Last week he had, what, 80 yards? Oh, yeah. Last week was terrible. Yeah. But this week, I mean, I'm going to stop using struggle sometimes because they in the NFL, and these to field NFL teams. And I like the coast wins because like I say, yeah, these the games you're going to have to win. But yeah, my colleague, Coastal's four and three, Coastal's four and three coming in. I mean, I would imagine most people would have had the Texans winning that game, you know, but the coast stayed four and three, at least they ain't, you know, but I can never, I could never believe in Anthony Richie. And it's sad because he went to Florida. But I can't believe in Anthony Richardson, bro. He's 10 for 32, 175, one touchdown, one pick. But he just, he's not accurate to me, man. Got a ridiculous arm. Now, you know, that's why he could throw a hundred yards. Good gracious. Arm is stupid, man. But see, that's why I'm like, I don't really trust that as much. I like the tape. I don't like in tangibles. That's why I wasn't so high on Drake May. Because Drake got an arm just like that. Like got a arm like crazy, like, sip the ball, throw every throw and do that. I like the process. Anthony Richardson got no accuracy. He won those players to look good or look good, but when they don't look good, they look bad. Like if that long ball is completing, like he was the Alec Pierce in week one, every time he decided to throw it 60 yards down the field, it looked good. But when you throwing bomb after bomb after bomb, and it's not being completed, it's like, okay. Yeah. You know, I think, I think they wasting the career, Jonathan Taylor too, bro. Hank, you just think he's just career just being wasted? I mean, bro, he's like a top running back. And who won the top running backs in the league, bro? It is. But that's why they got, that's why they break them. How it is. That's what I was saying about Tennessee with Derek Henry, bro. Same situation. Tennessee wasted all them years of that dude career, bro. And it's the same situation with Jonathan Taylor in Indianapolis. Like same situation, bro. Jonathan Taylor need to go ahead. Well, see, we got B-Raw about you. I like B-Raw. Who's you? Who's you about to say? What everybody's super star, bro. Yeah, I like B-Raw. Matter of fact, I love B-Raw. But, but, you see, I know. If I could get somebody over here where I could almost guarantee a hundred plus on the ground again. Jonathan Taylor different. You know what I'm saying? I hope we'll be able to keep B-Raw as that red zone with great blunt type of road. That'd be fun. You know what I'm saying? And just have Jonathan, you know. Yeah, that would be fun. And keep Echola and move him to like the nickels. The nickel was, I was our third down back. Our third down back. Yeah, third down back. That's it. Third down back. Pass catch him back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you get, hey, hey, you get, we get Jonathan Taylor with our line and I restops quarterback. You pencil us in, bro. I'll be get somebody like that. Hey, you too? As I said, he started out so good. I said, oh, we gonna cook because the best run, they got one weakness is that it's their run defense. So I said, oh, B-Raw about to cook. I can see it, but you know, they, like I said, they, they, they, they stepped up and they, they clamped down on them to hold it down. But he only had, he had 16 for 65. So it's full yards, 4.1 carry or whatever. So, you know, but I don't know. See, like I tell you, I'm so old school, bro. I remember if you're, if you're running back, didn't get 25 runs. What's wrong with you? Yeah. Running back, not the same. Running back, not the same. League ain't the same. Jayton. We had at the point for this. In the game, we were almost in. Yeah. In the game where we had the lead for most of the game, Jayton almost threw 40 times, 38 times. You know, so the running, the running backs, I think we runs two running backs. There was 24, 24 runs to running backs. That used to be one running back. And your backup might get 10. And that's why I throw 25 times a game. And that's why it goes back to me. When I say that's why it's so hard to stop. I can send those running quarterbacks. Because Jayton added another eight runs. It adds another, you know what I'm trying to say. For example, you said what, 30, that old school, you released 30 to 35 touches for a running back. Right. If I go look at Philly, say, Q1 22, per 10, that's 32. You give game well another five. I mean, that's, that's, and then Shipley got two. That's almost 40 curries. Yeah. So Philly, Philly still keep that old school grinded out style. They always had, they always was, that was, that was all. It's always meant Philly. I can't think of a Philly quarterback. Something like that will be, will be just as dominant. Unstoppable, bro. Will be unstoppable. And that's when we look our best when Echler clicking, when B Rob clicking, when Jay able to run in the passing game just, just floats off of that. I didn't realize everybody in scary, turd popping open running Chris ropes. Yeah. I didn't even realize Ekran seven for 52. I ain't know he had that many rush yards. I ain't realize he was, he was cracking that many open. Thought they was following him up, but I thought he was getting locked up for real. For real. I was like, I but yeah, man. That's all the games around the league that well, the Falcons, Falcons beat the Bucks. Falcons beat the Bucks. Yeah. Like we, like we said, it was close. It was close. Back at the two picks. But yeah, the Bucks, the injuries show. That's just going, yeah, that's going, that's going to hurt. That's going to hurt too much for them to overcome, bro. Right. Let me look and see who was there. Kay, Aughton. If you say, I mean, that's what we said. I'm going to have to be Kay, Bucky. We have to be Aughton. Yeah. And Richie Y. Bucky had seven catches for 40. Kay had nine for 81. I've been in that. It was there. Michelle Y.F.F. for 38. Like it was all two four touchdowns. They do all that. They only lost by five points. About five points. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. They bottled up B. John. Well, yeah. 13 runs for 64, 63. I ain't going to say bottled up, but they just didn't run a lot. The average almost five a pop. But yeah, Cal Piss came, got off. Let's see. Yeah, Cal Piss. Finally. Finally. Finally. Finally. But he received that tight end. I feel like he should be. He should average at least 60 yards again. Especially on a on a receiving court. It's not that strong. Like, yeah, I really, I'm not crazy about them. Like they're receiving court. People like Drake London, but I never really been big on Drake London. He's he's he's decent, but like I said, he's a good receiver. To me, Cal Piss is better than Drake London. Yeah. Yeah. Cal Piss is so Cal Piss should be the best tight end in the lead. You know, yeah. Like skill wise and ability wise. That's what everybody thought coming out. You know what I'm saying? But I don't know what it is, man. It's got to be a want to or. Yeah. Work tactic something. Yeah. It's something what Cal Piss on why he just he just ain't getting it done, man. Last thing I want to talk about. I'm going to switch all around. I'm going to switch sports, bro. Your boys, man. What's going on with him, man? You're your Lakers, man. We winning. Y'all cooking. We winning. Y'all cooking, bro. See, bro, I didn't step on that floor. Oh, no. It's easier for me to talk when they not making crazy decisions like that. Yeah. You make it a little bit easier for me to talk to talk about them. But I have to see. I have to see because they always come out strong like this. And then once the league starting to heat up, I think the Warriors might be undefeated too. But we'll see. We'll see. I like what Anthony Davis doing. Anthony Davis is like he could be the decent player of the year. If he play AD plan. Yeah, AD plan with a fire on them right now. I want to see if he can stay healthy. You know what I'm saying? Because that's been his whole thing, bro. He come out and he missed half the season because he don't, you know. Yeah. That's what I say. We got to see. We got to see. I want like to make a move and get another and get another player. I feel like we need some help. What you need? Like what position? If we can get with LeBron favorite shooter, I still don't feel like we have a consistent shooter. I like us to get like when we had contiguous car will poke like a 3 and D. Yeah. So I'm going to play defense and make some threes. Because I mean when you play with LeBron, it's not even about what we want. Yeah. It's not even about what we need. It's just about what LeBron feel. What LeBron feel is best for the Lakers. Let me see who y'all can say that again. What LeBron feel LeBron feel is best. Let me see who y'all got LeBron could be like, man, go get Danny Green. I like when I Danny Green. Danny Green to be a Lakers. Yeah. I mean, I would imagine that they would want Dalton connect to be that. You know what I'm saying? That three point that shooter, you know, and then college that's what he shoot. Boy could play. Don connectors. He's nice. Yeah. But I'm not coming from college to the pros and this is almost any sport, especially basketball and football. Oh yeah. You got to come show me. You got to come show me. So what you did in college, you know, look at Marquel folks, Marquel folks was probably one of the best college players I've seen. Now, to cause winning. I don't think that I've seen, but in the past couple, maybe five, six, seven years, what he did up in Washington was got him got him got him drafted. Number one. Yeah. Folks was good. But it just couldn't translate translate. Yeah. But that's the thing. That's the thing. Like I say, I sort of I could agree with you on that because connect ain't it's like you look at skill sets, you know what I'm saying? Connect ain't really got no speed. He ain't like a physical power. You know what I'm saying? He just get the job done. It's like, okay, is this going to translate to the next level? You know what I'm saying? You see somebody like like Zion or Kyrie, AI, you know, they got they got a skill set that you'd like. Yeah. Oh, my goodness, ain't going to be to keep up with him. Yeah. Gilbert Arenas first step. And that's what you need. You even need to be like, like you said, Kyrie Irvin or I feel like you need to have one specific thing that he do breathe to make it mean. And like you say, like how you say, Ronnie needs to find that that one thing to stick with. You know what I'm saying? He don't have that yet. But I feel like if connect going to come in, he needs to be able to shoot at a higher rate. Yeah. He got to he got to he got to he got to make a roll. He got to make a roll for itself. Look at because you're not having. God, I forget the bad man name every time I think about him play with the Hawks was just a three point shooter. Oh, there's a lot of them over there with the Hawks. You got him. I'm saying he played he played with him before, though. He I think he retired now, but he was just all he did was shoot her. Her. Hi, right. Nah, that was him really shoot threes. It was. Cow, Cove, Cow, Cove. Cow, Cove. I could I forget his name every time I think about him. That man, he made a roll for itself. It's just he's the dude. He's going to shoot threes, you know. Yep. That's becoming a game to do. Yeah. That's what the league is. Three. Yeah, cow, Cove up in there. Yep. You need three, put them up in and he's going to get double when you need the three. No. So. Yeah, three. Yeah, undefeated. Yeah, the Warriors undefeated this in the West. Yeah, the Warriors and the Thunder. I like the Thunder. Are you worried? That's all about the A. So are you worried because I think the Warriors, I think they time is right. I think it's the Thunder's time right now. Between Thunder and probably still nuggets, right? Yeah. Are you worried about the Thunder right now? Am I worried? No. No, the Thunder. The Thunder is a great team. I think they young. I think that they they need to experience more loss. So to to be able to get over the hump that they don't realize that they're going to hit come play off time because they're going to be a playoff team. They might finish number one in the West, but I don't see them. I don't see them winning the ship just because lack of experience. All right. Like of experience. But I do think I do think the Timberwolves. It's going to be a sneaky team. Why? Because they got rid of big cat. Oh, that's that's that's that's that's upgrade with that. Nope. You saw that you can start with that. Getting ready him was was. But. But yeah, I haven't had any. Because because now just how far they made it last year. they know what it takes now to get over that hump. Just like how the Celtics, the Celtics what, lost in the Easter conference, you know what I'm saying? A couple years, paying back one and a ship, they know what it takes to get over that hump, come play all the time. They know it's a turtle race and it's not necessarily a sprint. You know what I'm saying? So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And as much as I hate to say it, but I love to say it, because it's my team, you can't sleep on LeBron 80. Nah, nah. I mean, Bron, somehow, some way, he always got the magical moments in him, bro. Much as I hate to say it, I'm an advocate LeBron hater, like, you know what I'm saying? I respect this game, but I always, I'm gonna root against that dude in everything. And it's crazy. I'm a LeBron hater, but a die hard Laker fan. I don't know how that, how that can. It's crazy. It's crazy. So, nah, I miss the best role player ever to play the game. I feel you though, because if he came to the Wizards, I would have been the same way. Like, I can't, I can't, help us win, but I want you to be garbage. I hate you. But, last thing on the MV, I want to ask Wiz, you think the Spurs gonna take another step up with Wimby and them this year? First, yeah. I think the experience that Wimby just got, like I say, sometimes you gotta take losses to gain the experience and wins. I think the loss that Wimby just took to the USA team in the Olympics is gonna motivate him even more to play harder, to understand how he has to work, just to understand a lot more about the game. He gonna come with vengeance in his career, not just this year. In his career, I was looking at an interview that Wimby did, and he was like, how he just lost respect for NBA players because he thought they worked way harder than what they worked. Mm-mm. Yeah. He was like, I thought these guys was busting eight young men. I know they work hard. Like these dudes on the club had to do it. He said he came to the league and they was like, nah, some of them work hard, but a lot of them don't work as hard. So, I like the mentality. I remember going to clubs down here back in the day, man. Now you see the Wiz's players on, I'll be out there sizing them up, like, man, I could probably go out. I'll be looking up like, I could probably go out. This man. Yeah. But nah, I think they could take a step up, and depending on Wimby, they could be a threat because Chris Pol, I think he gonna be a big difference maker there for me. Not points, not scoring wise, leadership wise, and facilitating the offense. I think that's sort of what they needed is somebody who could just facilitate. Like, he gonna get the ball where it need to be. He gonna set Wimby up with the pass that he need. He gonna, you know what I'm saying? So Chang gonna really be able to get open shots, heard some bars, better looks, you know what I'm saying? So I think that opens it. It's gonna open it up for them, man. I like this first. I like this first. I think they still gonna need one more piece. Yeah, I think they need one more piece, Pry. Yeah, I think they need one more piece. I think Pry. I don't like Wimby playing the center. I don't like for the role that you need him to do with the, I mean, cause Wimby is the number one option. Yeah. But when you're the number one option, and you Wimby, you, you, you, you tall, but you don't have a Joe and B type of playing to be getting down there banging with all of those centers. I would like for them to, I would like for them to get a center. Even if it's like a Brook Lopez, even if it's a center like that, where you could slide Wimby somewhere else, where he not taking a punishment. You know what I'm saying? You have to check the, the and B's, the Joker's. Yeah, that's gonna be, that's gonna be a lot. And tap on the office and ask him to come around and go dunk on these players or sprint the floor hard or whatever the case may be. Yeah, but you think he'll be exposed with his long, linky self against some of them power forwards though? No, no, cause he's just, he's just, he's just as athletic as them. That's shit. They might be exposed. They better hope he don't come. Yeah, plus, cause you know, these falls are small. Like, these falls you gotta think like, and what you was saying, plus you get, cause Wimby liked to play around that three point line and stuff like that. So you get a center, you get a center, like how we got Valentunus. He probably been perfect there. It's like, it's like, Yonus, like Yonus can go play the center, but why would I have him go take that punishment? That's so Brooke right there, where Brooke can kind of stretch the floor and grab rebounds, take a little bit off of Yonus. So then when I need Yonus to grab a rebound and sprint the floor hard, he's able to do that. They should try to get somebody like a, I say like, like our boy McGee or what you call it. Kevin Looney or somebody. Looney, DeAndre Jordan, like. Yeah, I like, I used to call Robert Williams. But yeah, hey Looney, one of them. Yeah, somebody like that. Yeah, I can see that. I can see that. And then move everybody down like so Chan could play the two. They can all go back to natural positions cause when we had the boss, it's asking a lot for him. Yeah, it's asking a lot. Yeah, good shit, good shit. But yeah, that's it, bro. That's it for the day. You know, salute everybody who watching, you know what I'm saying? Salute. Salute, salute. And yeah, check us out. Shout out to the commander. Shout out to the commanders. Hail to the commanders. Came out with that dub. Think Jayden, no, no, no. Is Jayden, is Jayden Lee and Ricky the year now? What do you mean now? I'm just saying, cause you know, the best fans want to act like, you know, listen, if it's still the best fan out there who thinks that Caleb Williams. I don't even think that they believe that coming into the game. Yeah, yeah. But if they still believe that after today's performance, then I commend y'all cause I probably said the same thing. He was on the command. You would die hard, baby. You would die hard. You gonna die hard. I don't know what true, but I probably still said the same. Well, yeah, shout out Jayden Daniels, man. Shout out his toughness. You know what I'm saying? Shout out his toughness. Shout out, just shout out, just shout out to the commander. Shout out Dan Quinn. Shout out Noah Brown. Shout out Skurry, Terry McClellan. We got to figure out a way to get you something. Eyes and back to feet of something. You just got to dee on high step all the way down the field. Hey, man. Hey. Hey. Yeah. I said, oh, no, I said, oh, come on, Terry, about that, Richie. Yeah, you knew it. I said, I said, see, what I'm talking about right here. And then what they do, and then we kick the field goal. I say, look, if you get in the end zone right there, cause that's the second or third time I didn't see you get clipped up by your ankles this year, baby. Yeah, man. Ah, they didn't make it. I got to get on you because I love you, baby. It ain't making it. It ain't making no better than the Jaden. Just, you know, he jumped up out the one later in the game. Like, come on, that's the quarterback you to receive. But you supposed to be the one to get about it. You know what I'm saying? It's all good. It's all good, man. But yo, on to the Giants. On to the Giants. It's to be, hopefully we playing better. Hopefully we beat them by 30. How we supposed to beat them the first time? How we supposed to beat them? Yeah, we gonna get them cause our offense clicking now, you know, granted they got a kicker now. So there ain't gonna be no excuses. That they don't have no quarterbacks at all. They got a kicker with no quarterbacks. At all. Our defense should cook again. I am, I am, I am on top of that. On top of that. Well, I want to see, I'm a whole dog from now on. I want to see if they gonna start through lock with Dan Jones. Either way, either way, don't matter. And my prediction to this, to today's game would have been a little bit closer if we didn't kick so many field goals. Yeah, now you was there as far as us moving the ball or whatever, like, yeah, I think I had what, 27-20. No, 27, yeah, 20. I was like 30 years ago. No, 27-17. I had 27-17 if Jayden played 20, 20 to 17 if Marcus played. We do our offense and our penalties made their defense look better than what it was. Yeah, yeah. But we gonna go and play. I don't want to take everything away though because their defense, they play. I was like, dang. I'm like, you know, corners, their secondary, they played. I'm like, okay. And then like I say, sweat up front was a difference maker. Like sweat played, man. Sweat played ball today. Salute to that dude, man. I never wanted you to go, my boy. But we moved the ball so easily. And that's what I've seen. I mean, like you said, you said that that Jamison came in and made a difference for the Browns, but their defense was the same. You know what I'm saying? And we moved the ball easily on them. Yeah, yeah. We just like hooked the ground. We moved it easily on them. But like I said, you know, Jaden wasn't a hundred. You know what I'm saying? They might've got a 75% Jaden a day. But we don't have a back to a couple weeks from now. So it ain't gonna be a hundred next week either. So we just got to get used to it. And you know how physical the Giants games are. So, hey, we like to play. It's gonna be a dog fight. It's gonna be one of them kinds of city raiders games where you think it's a blowout, but because it's one of them in division games, it might be a little closer. Plus a couple of linemen went down. Coluq went down. He went out. Wiley was in and out the game. Got to see how they doing. Hopefully Brandon Coleman be back out of protocol this week. So, you know, if Coluq out for a while, maybe Brandon to play or hopefully they could get back right back to flipping, flopping into whatever, whatever. But we'll see all that later this week. We'll be back on here later this week. To preview that giant, talk about whatever going on in the NBA and in the field. Cities that going Cowboys, they losing right now, 14-10. So, yeah. That's it, y'all. Peace out. Peace. Peace.
