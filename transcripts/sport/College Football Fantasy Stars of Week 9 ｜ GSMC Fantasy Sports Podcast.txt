I'm going to take a little respite from the world of the NFL for a little bit and talk about the world of college football as always. We talk about NFL fantasy stars. We can't forget about our college football ones as well. For any fantasy college football players out there watching today, it should be a good one here because we have a lot of interesting performances from this past weekend to discuss and overall a lot of breakout performances as well. How further ado, let's talk about them. At the quarterback position, this is a guy who I feel like finally found a formula that works for him in a very important game for this Notre Dame team because we always think about Riley Leonard as someone who is an effective runner of the football but his dual threat abilities really suffer when it comes to the passing game. He's not as effective as a passer as we want out of a dual threat QB and we've seen it throughout the season. We've seen him put together very solid rushing performances but haven't necessarily seen him pass the football as effectively as you would like for someone of his caliber and for someone playing that kind of program. But against Navy at MetLife, it all came together. 13-21, 178 yards, two touchdowns to the ear, still had 10 carries for 83 yards and one touchdown on the ground with a total of 29.4 fantasy points but this proved that Riley Leonard is going to be a scary guy should Notre Dame get into the CFP. And they're still very much in the discussion. Remember as an independent it might be tougher for them to truly prove to the committee without being in a conference their strengths. And so they needed this win against a ranked Navy side who for all intents and purposes was looking like they could have upset Notre Dame with their style of play but ultimately came up very disgustingly short. Navy could not necessarily get anything going. And so Notre Dame rolls on and if you want to see Riley Leonard succeed this was the performance that showed that he can succeed in both manners. The air into the ground and it's a very important one because they face another military academy looking to knock them down a peg in the army. So this performance is truly paramount to the success of Riley Leonard and it's Notre Dame team as well. So congratulations to Riley Leonard for making this list for the first time. The running back position this is a guy who's going to turn a lot of heads in the playoff race especially in the ACC that's getting just that much more congested as weeks go on. How about the shard Smith of the SMU Mustangs. 26 carries, 177 yards, two touchdowns, 27.4 fantasy points. So week before a big game against Pitt that proves what those schools would be an ACC contender. Not for nothing I feel like SMU is one of those teams who relies on the explosiveness they have on the off and the side of the football. They're going to win games by beating you by scoring as many points as possible before you know can even blink your eye. And so the shard Smith being a part of this offensive unit is highly integral to their standing in both the ACC and CFP races because if you know one offensive weapon for SMU is off then who knows how this team will translate in a tougher game from the stretch because not for nothing Pitt's looked very efficient and their defense is very scary. So I feel like if SMU does not look prepared for that game then they're challenging. But for the time being I feel like SMU is going to be a team ready for anything here in the ACC down the stretch. But it's going to be dependent on guys like for shard Smith to step up because as much as I love Kevin Jennings there might be a time where his dual-fight ability to get exposed and Pitt could be that team. So you need that balance on your offense if you're SMU but for the time being where shard Smith is definitely deserving of a place on my list. At the wide receiver position it's a little bit tough to kind of parse through these wide receiver performances. No one really stood out but I feel like this guy is making his second appearance on my list actually is one of those guys who you wouldn't have expected starting the year to really have as much of an impact as people think. But as someone who has been all too familiar with him this season and all too familiar to what he brings to the plate for Texas as a Texas Longhorn Spain I really think we're starting to see the growth maturity of this young man in the Andre Moore. I feel like he's one of the younger players in that wide receiver core. He is going to be someone who for many years here at the program would be someone who potentially has so much more room for growth because of the fact no one really expected him to break out this early in his career here. But this game a very rough game for Texas where they needed every bit of their offense production fiber receptions 97 yards two touchdowns for a total of 24.7 fantasy points for the Andre Moore. Let's go to show that if you know Texas are in games in the stretch especially in this very tough stretch after their buy where they're facing Florida, Arkansas and Kentucky teams very capable of knocking them down a peg and then in their final game of the season going on the road to Kyle Field to face a very very physical Texas A&M team who was looking to potentially eliminate them from peak attention. You're going to need versatility in your offense. That's the name of the game for Texas and what that's what their cradle is that they live by. So look for the Andre Moore potentially as the season grows on get more and more looks at the YRC position. Most importantly have the translate over into many more years of the Archimanding era of success for him and this team because I feel like this season for Texas has proved to be a wake up call a little bit in their first two real big SEC tests. At home to Georgia they got knocked down a peg. On the road to Vanderbilt it's now becoming a very tough team to play against at home and not necessarily a pushover anymore here on the SEC. I feel like Texas is starting to realize what it needs to truly compete year in year out in the SEC and the Andre Moore could be an X factor to their success in this conference for many years. And now just two guys who I wanted to mention not necessarily because of the fact that I would choose them over any of the other three guys I picked because it was very difficult in terms of trying to pick so many different people at so many different positions because of the fact that there were not that many good performances by certain positions. But these are two guys who on national titles contending teams could prove to be vital integral to their team success. One being a running back who people can't often forget about in this Miami offense and a Penn State quarterback potentially is going to have to play in the biggest game of the year next week for them but truly showed what he could look like in that one and showing how serviceable he can be for the nettingly Lions and witnessing him first hand on the campus of Penn State really shows me how electrifying this kid can be. So without further ado let's talk about Damien Martinez and then discuss Bo Pribula. Let's talk about Damien Martinez first 15 carries 148 yards two touchdowns 29.4 fantasy points to completely take over the state of Florida Miami has now beaten all the Florida teams a season and this one wasn't necessarily you know about you know compiling a lofty number of yards for Cam Ward as we've seen in the past for him. It was about Damien Martinez and let's not forget how good Damien Martinez is an Oregon state transfer comes into Miami looking for a fresh start really boosting this team as well because not only do you have to account for the effectiveness of Cam Ward and one of the better receiving cores in the nation now you have to account for a very physical explosive back in Damien Martinez and he proved that if you can't handle the entirety of the Miami offense he's going to be the knockout punch week in week out. If you know there are any games coming up where Cam Ward you know has a slow start is not as effective as you would like him to be or your receiver core is a little bit unsettled and look for Damien Martinez to really be a breakthrough star down the stretch of Miami. Then Bo Prabula stepping in for an injured jeweler after half time in that game against Wisconsin very big win I was actually at the Penn State campus had the pleasure of being around an atmosphere that even though they weren't playing at home was really truly electrifying nothing can beat a college campus on game day especially the number three team in the nations and so Bo Prabula in a tough spot you know on the road and a highly integral game before the big one against Ohio State at home 11 of 13 98 yards one touchdown 10.7 fantasy points a highly effective kind of spot start for him not necessarily a real start for him but still an effective one there and should he be you know the starter have to replace Drew Aller for this game against Ohio State look for him to still remain effective. I feel like you know I don't want to get ahead of myself talking about this game but seeing the hype or that campus expect Beaver Stadium to be very packed that weekend expect you know what happens in this one for Penn State to stick with this team. It truly is an incredible atmosphere the Penn State is building and they are truly a sneak contender here they don't necessarily win pretty but they get the job done and they do it well and so that just one to acknowledge Bo Prabula you know as someone who hasn't necessarily gotten the plot it's received from a five star recruit coming in to Penn State having to sit behind Aller for at least this year and stepping in as well as he did in that tough situation and they were even down and leading them to this comeback victory close to him close to the entire campus of Penn State that was truly electrifying if you ever get the chance to go there go it's a great atmosphere but that is my list definitely a couple players who you know might have been out of the ordinary maybe not necessarily players you hear too much about but that's the beauty of this list I want to get people more known get players more known that can help you in your fantasy college exploits without further ado we're going to take a quick break on the other side we're going to begin our positional rankings for week nine of the NFL season talking about some fantasy QBs who could warrant a start for you this coming week don't go anywhere we'll be right back to talk about them after this short break
