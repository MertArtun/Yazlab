Everybody doing this week. Good, good, good. I was homecoming homecoming was lit. Had a good time. I mean, I saw a, I said, I was like the first time I saw it like. Movie type shit. We had the, um, I'm shooting a movie. Oh, one of my homies actually was shooting, um, shooting some shit, which was actually weird to see. Like my man's coming through with the fucking camera and seeing like the fake lab. App up and shit. I'm like, nigga, don't, don't, I don't, I'm not about to be a fucking, I'm not about to be a fucking, I'm not about to be a fan of your. Yeah, it's like, it's that jerk. Yeah. Like, yo, you know, I'm saying, you know, I go to home coma. Everybody just shows me love because I was that nigga. And it's a slow. I wasn't about to be that boy, but no, I was dope. And I had a good time. I was, I would suggest that anyone who's never been to the Hampton University's homecoming should go. Now, how do you get the D in front of it? Is that just. Is that because I'm not. I'm asking the question. Yeah. Some schools like, you know, there's the Ohio State and there's, you know what I'm saying? Does Hampton be a real D or are you just giving it to the I mean, we are, we are the Black Harbor. Okay. So when you get those, all the George Washington Carver of colleges. Yeah. But not local, but like national national like on a national level, right? Was that a sound? That's how I'm thankful for, for, I'm confused. What did you just say? My man watches. What? Okay. Come on. No. Not in front of the bro. How'd it get to you? He's gonna be home soon. Did you go to the, you go to the football game? Or did you? No, I didn't do that. I do. I interviewed you. So I do go to the football game more, more times than not. This was one of the first home comes I've been to where I had zero responsibility. Like I, I wasn't the person that got the car. I wasn't the person that drove. I wasn't the person that had to make sure I was cool. Cause I'm right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. To me, I would initiate it. You know what I'm saying? We do he made a black heart. Harvard does it. We don't win it. We don't win as much as we used to. Cause we stepped up and a lot of times when you know what I mean. We actually did a new crowd or whatever. But, you know, whenever we go again, some of our old folks, we still be spending that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we slept and see. That's what we want to do. You know, I mean I went through there slap them up. They don't know what I'm talking about. I mean they didn't like it. They're gonna slap them up. They homecoming, slap them up. I mean, slap, you know what I mean? I forget. It was like 47 to 17 or something. We was cool though. How was your weekend, good brother? I was good. I was gonna boy play this weekend. Eagles won this weekend. Relax. For the uninitiated, where does the boy play? Boy play for the tip. You did? The table is divided appropriately for this, right? Because in Philadelphia, in the powerhouses, in high school football, you know, you got prep. We've been, you know what I'm saying? The dog, the kickin' the castle for quite some time. You know what I'm saying? And then you got tep up and coming, you know what I'm saying? Winning of a lower division. Big dog. I mean, yeah, yeah, correct. I'm bigger fish in the smaller pond, so we say. And then they jump in up into the big pool. And then you get to see the two powerhouses clash this year, hopefully. We will be in the game, you know what I'm saying? I'm looking forward to that. But you know, I'm more so basketball guy. Yeah, so. And they, they didn't even get it. They're pretty good. They pretty good. Hey listen, you can, you can argue over here. I stick to my lane. We win the state champs like it's like it's nothing in football. So I ain't, I ain't, you know what I mean? Yeah, so we just look to keep it going. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, you know what I'm saying? Now you, you know what I'm saying? You will stay champs over there. Now it's time to come to the big names. City, city, city champs. May everybody come out. Yeah, please do. Is there a little wager? I don't know. He's way more. No, no, no, he knows way more about like the actual players that are on the squad. We nice and we got young boys. I don't know what they have. So I will let me, let me, because I don't want to get stuck in it to a wager. And then like, you know what I'm saying? Like if a joint where I should only be betting like 10 hours when he's got me up to like. It can be, it can be, it can be a comedy, fitness, you can lay whatever I do. Yeah. So before I get, before I name the terms that I'm comfortable with, I would like to do just a tiny bit more, you know what I'm saying? Here's the name. Please don't take that as my being not being comfortable in my squad. We just win championships. You know what I'm saying? We win championships. I mean listen, the prep, they got my one young boy, super tough, it's going to be, it is super tough. Jet is super, Jet Harrison, yeah. Could be better than brother Wayne when it's all said and done. Maybe better than father when it's all said and done. I'm here for all of that. Young boy is good. And I know him basketball. Football, they say he's an animal. Basketball, he's great. All right. Since you talk about basketball, I mean, let's start there. Let's start with basketball because there was a moment, you know what I'm saying? She's talking about prep. I said Joe's prep. He asked who won championships. There was a moment in the NBA, you know what I'm saying? That was her round of world, not her but scene round of world. It was something that was, you know, led up to, you know, a lot of media behind. And I just want to know if you got, if it got you to the point where it was supposed to get you to, did you had the warm and fuzzies? Why would it give me the warm and fuzzies? Listen, people say it was a monument. First time of a father against the play on the court with his son. No, I mean, listen, that's dope. You can't take that away from anything like that. Regardless of how we feel about King James and Bronnick should be there, whatever the case may be, we're talking about a dad playing with his kid at the biggest stage of a professional sport event for that sport. Like, you can't get nobody that. So, like, just look at it. She's dope. Damn. It felt like it was so, they were doing it so he cut me history. We all know that. But at the end of the day, is it still thorough? Yes, all that. Like, it's decent. I'll pay my son. It would be a hell of a moment for if I'm the dad, it would be hell of a moment for me. But outside of that, I don't think people really care. Oh, no, the people really care. They do. They care. They don't care. But people, a lot of people care. The media care. It just felt like it's manufactured. Like, you played the play. You know what I'm saying? Like, okay. It was manufactured for him to go. But that's what I'm saying. That's why it missed the mark for me. People keep it all the way through. It was when Mr. Mark for you regardless. There wasn't too much that could happen. When he got drafted, it didn't matter. Yeah, that was what it was for. It felt manufactured. I mean, he made the NBA and they played together. I was like, that's double shit. Yeah, yeah. Like, you think I just hate LeBron, but that's not a hypothetical. LeBron would have been leaving all of this behind between me and me. Naturally. If he was good, he would have been the same tall friend. Yeah, but he's not good. He can play basketball. Sure. He's not a NBA player right now. No, he's not. Okay, when nobody says he's not an NBA player, he's got NBA prospects. He's not. He's a good basketball player. Now, right? Could be NBA NBA player eventually. Yeah, he also got work on the body. What, six, three? Yeah, if that and he got a true point guard. So I'm just saying it's like I don't know if he would have been a doper moment. He don't have a skill set. He can play defense. Yeah, but at least he's got skills. He's got something with skill set. He's not a defender like a lot of them defender. No, he's not. He's too small. He could become one. He should be in the G League. Well, it's great in both now. Yeah, I mean, I don't care because it's not it's not my team. It's not my kid. So like all that warm and fuzzy, like it's not it's not there for me, right? Like if this was Allen Iverson and his son that may be a little different for me because Iverson played on my team. That's my guy. You know what I mean? Whatever, but like it's dope. Shout out to them, man. Sorry. If it wasn't manufactured, if it was more natural, he actually deserved to get drafted. And would that have done anything more for you to still feel the same regarding it? I don't I don't care. I don't think there's nothing I don't think there's anything that could have made the the the the the brown and brown join forces. Yeah, I don't really think there's anything like it is what it is. It's a cool little moment. Shout out to them. They got to do some stuff that never had been done before on the NBA level. They got to have a moment as a father, son and then cool. Not a season going like you know what I mean? Yeah, he'll pop up on the team from time to time. They said the Yemo, they said the boy connect there. But I mean like as much as cats get hurt, right? And brownie is a big enough name that he's going to get him caught. He'll get a call up if the right injuries happen at least once during the league. At least once. I refuse to believe whether he deserves to play is another thing. I agree with you. I think he at least gets What's his name? Yeah, yeah. I thought you were going to say something else. You were saying that you were going to go to the ranch. How we feel about this NBA season, man? This is terrible, man. I mean, I'm not in general, I'm going to take a big picture. I'm not saying projections. Because guess what? You got Jalback. You got a smaller Zion. You got Max Layray playing. You got Tatum there. Tatum is going to tear the league ass up and talk to the Olympics. You still got the old narratives. You got the bronze and the Jimmy's going to be mad. But you got the shade, Charlie. You got the Lucas that's mad. You got Ant Man that he's going to run this league. I think it's going to be obviously changing in the guard. Absolutely. I know we previewed it a lot, but this is going to be the actual change in the guard. These young guys is ready. They are out here booping. There's no one to look at now. You got LeBron and all young players. Steph still there. We got Ed Shea, Luca, Joel, Tauris, Halliburton, Zion Shea. The young boy from Detroit. We had this time. We had the top five players in NBA right now. You love on the spot top five. I love us on the spot top five, man. You're playing top five, I think. Luca Luca one. Yolkich Ant Man Tater Tater and Jolene B Jolly John John right now I don't see it anymore. Luca Jogin Tater You know, it's like freaking Joe, no, I don't see him right now. Oh, and no order, but Luca, Joe Kitch, Giannis. Actually you know, let me take Giannis off because I think I think yeah. I think yeah, I think he's kind of getting not exposed because that sounds like he's but like his limitations are starting to. So like, what's that? I said, Luca, Yo-Kitch, Ant for sure. You're struggling with that one. No, I mean, I mean, I mean, obvious choice is the obvious answer is you're Tatum is, but I'm just trying to make sure that there's nobody. Shai? Shai? Shai? Um. I appreciate that. So I like Shai and I actually think Shai has an opportunity to, he should be in a, and he's one of my, if I had to put my paper on it before the season and seeing Tatum play, I would have said Shai was my front runner for MVP. But you know, Tatum, he's gonna, he's got a chip on the shoulder. So, um, yeah, I guess Tatum, it's probably his father and, and, and, and, and B, um, he's unstoppable for sure. Yeah. I mean, I don't like being disrespectful to KD though. Like I still think KD, I'm not, I'm biased. I still think KD is still like, He's unstoppable. Yeah. Like, you know what I'm saying? And he just, yeah, it's just, he just don't be healthy. Jalen Brunson? No Jalen Brunson left? Not Tatum. Not Tatum. Nah, I mean, Poppa Shae and Jalen, I don't know if I'm talking about Top 5. I definitely think Tatum is better than him. But I think, oh, you said Brunson. Yeah. I thought you said Brunson. I was thought of. Hell no, not Brunson. Top 5? He ain't got a hell no. Ain't no, that's a hell no. This is a hell no, this is a hell no. This is a hell no. That's it. That's it. You right here. I thought you meant Jalen Brunson. You're saying like, you're right here. Hell no. You're right here. No, no, we not. We're not here like hell no. Yeah. It was a total. You ain't. He's one dude, I'm shot out to him. He got paid. I think he's a tough worker. I think he's talented. But I don't. That's Top 5. I don't think, yeah. That's Top 5 in NBA. I think he's one of them dudes that is really, really good. He has the ability to be the man on a squad. Something about me still thinks he'd be better off being the second man as opposed to like the man. Like, like, he just worried. He got worked so hard to get a bucket, man. And when you that. No, no, no, no. You don't have to work hard to get a bucket. That's one thing. You don't got to work hard. That shit is. He exerts a lot of energy to get a bucket because he's a little, he's. Okay. That boy, he's a good squad. He's. All right. This is about to be my cowboy. I'm telling you, I'm telling you. Yeah, no, no, I mean, I watched the game too. Like, I mean, I hear you. It's cool. It's easy. But like, he worked so hard. Let me say this. One thing I always said about Dwayne. We was that Dwayne. We went to the Miami heat. John, I never, I got watched him, but like, it was, you know, I watched him more. And I was like, damn, I never really, really peep how, how, how much effort he has to do to get a bucket. Like it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a lot of, it's a lot of movement. It's a lot of, like, it's not like KD where he's just rising to the top of somebody or, or AI. He's just crossing you one time and going to the cup. It's a lot of, it's a lot of getting someone involved. It's stuff like that. So like, well, Brunson, like it's a lot of, like he has the ability to break down anyone one-on-one if the opportunity allows. But if the opportunity doesn't allow, it's a lot, then the big man has to get involved. And it's a lot of screening. And then he takes a lot of. I don't know how he takes those clothes like this is. I'm trying to tell you how I watch people. I mean, no, I hear little disagreement on, on, on, on. And I like, I like the young boy. I think he was a boy. I think he was a boy. Oh, that looks good. I think neighbors are pink pickings. But um, so I think, I think you're hitting mostly the play. I know y'all love him. He's not one, but I don't know. Unless it will leave the, you know, it's fine. It's fine. I'll be the, I'll be the outlier. You know what I'm saying? And be right. Like a normal leader. You're not. You know what I'm saying? You can't be, you can't be the, the Caucasian James Heart and then be one in my book. You know what I'm saying? What do you mean James Heart? He's showing the bill. He always showed him the bill. That always? He's the stats. Always. Look at his stats in the playoffs. Always. What are you talking about? I disagree. What are you talking about? You can't, you can't. I disagree. I disagree. Didn't it? And this is the first time, wasn't it the last year? The first time being at the first run? No. Look at his stats in the playoffs. I'm gonna answer you. Look at his stats in the playoffs. The question is, that's what he does. You can't say James Heart. He's a ball. You can't, he's not, you can't. Look at his numbers. Listen, in the playoffs. Look at the green and disagree, man. Look at his numbers in the playoffs. He's gonna dribble the air out the ball. Look at his numbers in the playoffs, baby. What did you watch yourself? You watched him dance. So you missed, I'm gonna ask you. Let me get you up to speed. Let me get you up to speed. Dott just said, we want, since you just came in real notch a lot, like we wasn't on areas, man. That's a fire jacket. Shout out to the people. Shout out to the people. The car, were you in there? I'm here for that sake. I'm here for you. Bringing swag to the school spirit. This is the school spirit on swag. Was that one of the schools? No, this is Johnson Exclusive. I'm saying who paid? I'm saying this is Johnson Exclusive. Did you use the petty cash? No, no, no. No petty cash? No, this is straight out the principal pocket. The principal's budget? Budget? Budget? We just asked the pocket of budget. This is one of the budget. I'm still in money from this school. So you missed, you missed. He said, look, it's not good. Shout out to my bro from Mastin Mines. I know my creations. He creates varsity jackets. He hooked the brother. Hey, thank you, brother. Get you on the speed. So we talked about, first we talked about the woman, first we talked about LeBron and his son playing together. Dang, Paolo got 37. Well, if you had a woman, if it gave you the woman. And then Jerv said, Hampton is the carer in this of colleges. Oh, he said that. You agreed though. He said, let me be clear. He said that, I said, yeah, but they're local or national. Yeah. Who's local? I mean, who's local? I'm asking the, I don't know who's local. Hampton or carer, who's he saying is local? You cool? No, I'm asking the question. Get along then, cause I feel, I feel like. I mean, I got numbers to show you, Carver. No, we number. So, just for. Number 27. But, talk your shit. Number 27 in the what? 27 in the state. Number 800 in the country. 800. Yeah. Oh, that's 800 high schools. So, let me. What number are you in the country? What number is in there? Let me be clear. You said national. So, any comment I'm about to make. We will argue about anything. No. Number three, number three in the city too. Number three in the city. Beautiful young man or young lady that attends this glorious high school and is putting that work in and is doing their thing to get them to be ranked. But don't say but, cause then there's gonna be. However. Whatever works. However. What? Like, like, like, Doug, like. I can pull it up. That's not. I'm broke. You know, you know how I do numbers. So. Bro, I can go, I can go 30 minutes of the row out the state and like, I, like, who? Like they go, that's what they gonna. Oh, you think about the brand. I got you. He just saying nothing. He told you on two different pages. Yeah, you think about the brand. He's saying, we were talking sports and stuff. So, like, I just. You talking about sports. Oh, so you're in your educator bag right now. You said schools. I don't. I generally talk sports when we, when we sit at this table. So you're on hand in sports. When we sit at this table, we generally talk sports. There you are. Get your mind on the. I said generally. I said generally. He said school. I thought he said school. You said y'all was a Harvard. Yeah, we, we have. You talking about education. That's what I thought. I mean, that's what I thought too. I didn't know what you, baby. I misunderstood. How can I compare? How can I compare a prestigious university to a high school? You can't. Yeah, that's not fair to y'all. No, it's not fair to y'all. No, it's not fair to y'all. Cause you like, do you know what number you are in the, in the country? I do. And what? Like, what are you asking me? Being great. Being great. Greatness, Jer. Oh, you want to know number number one? And being great. We just great. Like some of us, 800 is cute. I'll let it go. Listen, both of y'all are great. I'll let it go. I'll let it go. I'll set out the head. I heard y'all do have the best homecoming. I heard the best, best HBCs. No! I heard it. This is something called G-H. G-Ho and G-H. No! I heard it, number one. So let me say it. Let me say it. Let's not do this. New Carolina A&T. So I heard it was Taufa, but I heard him. No, no, no, no, no. So it's like this. G-Ho is, is, is, is, is dope. You can just say it. Just be honest. Oh, good. And it's, and it's definitely a historically dope, you know, homecoming. However, what I'll say is, is that in the last four to five years, since we have gotten our new president, who has made it clear, he said he wants to be known for homecoming and got, hey, gosh, Danik, we've been known for homecoming since, you know what I'm saying? And I will say, so G-Ho is dope. I'm not saying that, but I'm saying, hey, same. Here you go. The same way my man said across here and said that, you know, about TEP and we are now in the big dogs of homecoming. And we are here to make it, make it be known. I expect you to say that though. Walks up to. Nah, I mean, you don't want, you don't want to go to homecoming in the project. I don't like going to homecoming in the project. Anybody out there watching out there, you know what I'm saying? They've been to all these homecoming. Let us know what you think, man. Top five NBA players right now. Like playing right now. Can't do the all time. Playing right now. Not all time. It's playing right now. Not, it could, or just the top. He's talking NBA. Don't not in the felt. You know, you don't want to show up. I got you. I got you. Yeah. Yeah. Jeez. Yikes. Oh, man. So. Dylon, Dylon, Dylon. Nah, nah, nah, nah. Honestly, it's been a minute since I watched the NBA. It's the new people because it's the boy. It should be. Who the boy that looked like? I don't even remember boy. Oh, that's not going well. The one that, the one that. Each time you got to ask somebody, it's top five. And they say, who the boy? Yeah, yeah, yeah. The top five. So I'm going to take mine. You pass, pass on that. Oh, yeah, I'm going to say you. I don't know. So I said, Luca. I would agree with that. I said, Luca, Jokic, Tatum, and B, and. And B line my top five. And, uh, uh, uh, Ant-Man. Yeah, that's, that's why I was, I didn't know his name. Top five. I didn't know his name. Ant-Man. Yeah, man, definitely in my top five. But not in B though. How's the entire freaking hardly play? Yeah, but he's most, most dominant player in the league right now. No. Yeah, he's most dominant player in the league right now. The motherfucker scored 70 points last year in the game. He's the most dominant player in the league. Talking about. Well, you ain't helping. It's, it's, it's. That's my pain. Let's switch gears a little bit. It's just my pain. But no, no, but the issue, the problem was, was you talking about Luca. Oh, yeah. I'm just going to put a curve on the right. The issue, yo, you, you, the issue. I don't want to see the night. The issue was, he said Luca. It's not number one. It's a J. That, that. And he said, it's J. Called Cajun James first. Who number one? Not Luca. Luca. Luca. Who's your five? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who's your five? Who's your five? I agree with y'all four. Who's five? Who's your, who's your, who's five? I didn't say it wasn't top five. I say it's not number one. Who's the top five? Who's your five? Who's the top five? He would probably be five. OK, who's your five? Who's your top five? I got to do order, but you all just got to say it. No, I didn't say it. I was just saying, you got Joker. You got Ant. You got Tatum. Joker and Tatum. I'll probably go. So I want to go and be. You said Luca. I said Luca. I said Luca. And I'm trying to say, I don't want to go and be. It will be either Yanis. I'm not putting Yanis. I think Yanis is still, I mean, if we are going like, you could, you could, Yanis is just as dominant as Ambitis, except Yanis. He's down here. He's only down here. He's only down here. He's only down here. Yanis is only down here. Sometimes being just, if you just do something really well, you know what I'm saying? If you do something really well. Yeah, but guess what? You're one trick pony. You say, I'm not saying, I'm not saying, I'm not saying Yanis has a bigger bag. I'm not saying Yanis. You know what season? Oh, I'm not. I'm not saying Yanis has a bigger bag than, than, than Joel. I'm not saying he's a, he's a, he's, he's more versatile. I'm just saying when he wants to do the one thing that he does well, he does it probably, especially in playoff. To this point, he's done it better than Joe, than, than Ambitis. And I love Ambit. I love him. I love him. I love him. He'll do better than, he'll do better than, than, than Bull. But I got some, I got some. Oh, I wanted to talk about injuries real quick. Um, she had a part, I don't, I don't care about money. She had a part, she had a part. That, that, that, what did that come on? The mic's hot. I just respect you. Yeah, not, not, not with D. George Washington, and his cart, cart, cart. I'm not even a little bit of slander. Okay. That wasn't disrespectful. Okay. Hey, all right, let's talk. What you want to talk about? She did a podcast when she talked about her. He has an agenda today. I just want he. He came prepared. He came prepared. So he really just wants you to get what you I'm going to pull a driveline. What you're not going to do is you're not you're not going to speak for me when I'm when I'm trying to help you out because clearly you want to get to where you want to go. I do want to talk about like no, do do the. Do you know just get out the way. What we say about it. So she did a podcast when she talked about her MBA salary and how much she makes it. WMB. WMB salary. How much she makes versus how much she spends. She says she's living outside of means. Her salary is 70,000. Her rent was 80,000. 8000. No, but 80,000 a year. 80,000. No, but 80,000. 80,000. No, but 80,000. No, but 80,000. No, but 80,000. No, but 80,000 a year. 80,000. No, 8000 a month. 8000 a month. Yeah. That's well over here. So just in general. Yeah. Wow. Just wish our thoughts on that type of logic from a. From a sports star. Well, the thing is, you know, the thing is when you talk about like her, like she looking at her, like she really don't know her finances. She's young. She's probably don't. She probably got somebody else. She probably got somebody else working on her finances, right? No. But she was asking. She didn't even know that. She didn't even know what was going on. She didn't know her money. Nothing. She was saying this. She didn't know anything. So what I'm saying is she's looking at her WMA contract. She doesn't. She doesn't. That's first. You know that she only made 70,000 apartment. 8000. But guess what? Her endorsements and anything else covers that. So she didn't look at individual streams of income. Right. She's looking at. I can afford this stuff. Yeah. You feel me? So if you if she was just looking at just the contract, like 70,000, if I'm just going off based on my WMA contract, I'm way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way. Let me, let me phrase it like this. Right. Let's say this was your daughter. Right. And like, they're just going strictly off of what she said in the interview. Right. I'm going to get a rebog or like because strictly what she said in the interview. Like we don't know. We don't know the logistics of it. She got all those contracts. Right. And she's like being in front of the fact that she's living outside of means. What would you say to her? But she's not really living outside of means. She's living outside. No, I'm telling you. The thing is she's living out of her means if she only had that one stream of income. That's the thing is the thing is the issue is, and that's how I said, she didn't know what it was because she got other multiple streams of income. But so technically she's not living out of her means because she got the endorsements. She got that now that that shoe deal, like she got paper. But if it was just if it was just if she was only if she was a regular WMA player, right? Yes. Guess what? She wouldn't be having that $8,000 apartment, whatever it is. I can guarantee that. She probably wouldn't even even even close. She probably wouldn't even be trying to have an $8,000 contract because I mean one thing that, you know, you know, I'm saying male or female one thing that comes along with when you go to the WMA. You know, you're a male or female one thing that comes along with when you become a high profile athlete is that you got to live a certain way. You got to get the perception that you live a certain way. You need a certain little security too. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think, I get what Don was saying. I know the other guy. I was just staring at him. I didn't say that. I just said, I don't know what I know what I know. I just didn't say that. I just didn't say that. I just didn't say that. I just didn't say that. I just didn't say that. I just didn't say that. I just didn't say that. I just didn't understand like, Don, like, what? Relax. It's like three nights of lice and then just have to tell you what to call for it. Who's third? Yeah, who's third? I'm not. He's not lice. I'm not. He is not part of the deluge. He's not lice. No, bro, y'all, y'all damn there. Y'all ain't standing that far apart from each other. Yeah. When we do the skin complex, we're not going to get into the, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the skin complex. We not going to get into that. I'm not going to do this. Finish it. Finish it. No, I'm just saying, like, so, I mean, yeah, to Chris point, like she's without, without hearing the whole, you know, without hearing the whole full context of everything she was saying, just going off of the things I've heard and read. She's not saying that she's broke. She's, she's actually what I, what I think she's doing, I think she's highlighting at the right time, because I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure there's a collective bargaining, grating and grating. I'm pretty sure there's a collective bargaining, grating and grating. I'm pretty sure there's a collective bargaining, grating and grating. I'm pretty sure there's a collective bargaining agreement or some sort of contract or something that has to be. Actually, it's not, but that's a there's something that so, or there, I'm sorry, they're trying to, they're trying to force a renegotiation. Yeah. Okay. Of their, of their salaries. Yeah. Mind you, the WNBA just reported that this season was the first one. They lost $40 million. Yeah. But they, they want to update contract. But that was, that was the, that was, I think, the, the first one was the, the, the first one was the, the, the first one was the, the, the first one was the, the, the first one was the, the, the first one was the, the, the the, the first one was that they've, the. The buying up, the, the bill that's dropped after the first months of spring. But the어�, cls of people in the snow, the, the- the deuxième bookium lunchsafe, that was the out to the ω and the beach They gon' care, you know what I mean? That's just, that's just- I just hope, I just hope that the way she came off in that interview is not factual. Cause better played players, better played athletes have gone broke. Oh, yeah. So like if she doesn't- I'm walking. To this point, if she doesn't know or understand her own finances and she's living outside of me to that point, because we're talking about, she's living outside her means in regards of where I live versus my WMA contract. So to Chris's point, she has other endorsements, but I'm sure she's spinning. If she's living outside her means in that regard, what- I mean, I would say she needs a better financial advisor. Her financial advisor should not be saying you can go get an $8,000 a month condo. But she also has- If that's what it is, right? But she should also have better understanding of her finances or somebody- But you're putting- So yes, you are correct. She should have a better, but being that she is what, 21, she's been- In certain level. She's been getting money since 19, at a million rate, that money just keeps coming in. You know what I'm saying? So to her, it's just there. She needs that person. Like every single person needs to be able to say whether you're 10, 15, 25 or 35, she needs that person to say, but okay, can you just- My man's losing his mind. I'm just scratching. Go ahead, yo. Yo, shout out to Angel. We gave you 15 minutes. We gave you 15 minutes to tell us about how broke you are, what you really not with. And I really don't understand why you even mentioned it on the podcast. Like why would you tell? And I just don't make it easy. So what did you wanna talk about? Cause I feel like you came with it. I wanna talk about the NFL season. Basketball's cool, but like we're not even- Oh, you're right. Listen, I agree. It's just cause you don't like basketball. You right. Why are you talking about baseball too? Who's that? It's just cause you don't like basketball. I mean, at Grand Slam, the freaking- We're a robber. Anybody in Rob comment? I just run. So I don't mind talking about that. Did we talk about what happened to him? Phillies. I'm not gonna do that. You don't wanna do this? You're upset. I'm not gonna do that. Who's your- I'm not talking to Phillies. Okay. I just realized what we did. We're upset. They said to Phillies, the reason why- And this is coming from somebody. I'm not racist. He's such a dope. They said a real mega hat. You're a mega hat, bro. The reason why we're losing, cause we're too white. I said, shit. Who said that? Oh, white guy. Like, on the team? No, not on the team. He said the reason why we're losing is because we're too white. I mean, wait. Well, he might have been right. Because we got you right. We don't have me. It's something you should say out loud. Hey, you shouldn't say that. There's certain ways you're supposed to say it. How you're supposed to say that is, the Phillies do not put enough resources in getting, not no, to getting Latin-born play. No, I mean, that's- I mean, I think- When people's told up, they're not saying they need black people. Yeah, I know that. I know that. They're talking to mid-Kids. I understand, but like, you can say the comment without naming a race. You could, man. No, but I didn't- I was with you on the resources part. They could have used specific- I see what's happening. What happened? I said something. You came with an agenda. I did not. You're about to turn me into a racist because you wanted to- So, okay, let me just say this. And then I'm gonna shut up because I see what you want to do. We are watching. It's like it's made a credit card. We are watching the ESPN algorithm, right? So just hear me out. Follow my flow. I wasn't even saying that about that though. Hold on, my brother. I know you're going with this. People be like, yo, how come- I'm not gonna let you do that. I'm not gonna let you do that. But guess what? Because you're gonna- They be like, yo, how come every single time I turn on a TV, they talking about a- You know, excuse my language. A bum ass squad that don't win no games. How come we're always talking about them? We just tried. Y'all saw it. We just tried. We tried to talk about Angel Reese. We tried to talk about the NBA and one of the most historic things we ever seen in life, which was a father and son playing best. My man said- I didn't have a problem with that. He said- I didn't have a problem with that. So you know what, sir? I didn't have a problem with that. I didn't have a problem with the father and son coming. The time is yours. You got it, brother. See, why you gotta go there, man? I'm gonna shut up. That was actually- You're gonna be shocked at what I'm saying. We was talking about baseball and the resources. Now we're just making a comment. I know, but you was- I know, but you was fishing there. You was fishing. I was fishing by the Angel Reese. The play back of the- The Angel Reese, I was- I was watching you. I ain't gonna hold you. I was stealing over the Angel. I couldn't believe we spent 15 minutes on my Angel Reese on the podcast. That was wild to me. It would be like- That was wild to me, though. Angel Reese on the podcast is wild. I mean, I feel- Hey, listen, if it's important to you, it's important to me. What's next? What is important to you, sir? Football. Man, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's get after it. Let's get after it in the NFL. We're in on my team. We don't have to start on my team. Oh, no. No, sir. You cannot just change the whole format of the show. You can't walk in late. I said football. You can't walk in late. Stand in front of the camera. So what about football? Get mad at the Angel Reese topic. We on football now, and now I say, we can talk about my team last. I'll start. Yeah, I'll start. What team, like when the season started, who did you expect to be where they are? Who didn't you expect to be where they are? Can I go first? Sure. If you were. He just had it, so he was about to say it. Yeah. If you were. Raise that question, you know. All right. From at the beginning of the season. Who's meeting expectations? Who's not meeting? Who did you expect to be where they are? Who didn't you expect to be where they are? OK. So if you remember when we did our first. You said that also to be third. Whoa. That's what you about to say? This ain't about Dallas. All right. Whoa. I was just, I just. Something with my man. I didn't even say that word. That's you. That you said. No, you said it at the beginning of the season. I was. All I said was in the beginning of the season. And then you said, yeah, if I get it, you said Dallas will be third. So I wasn't going there, but yes, I did say that. So I'm acknowledging. OK. I said that the Niners were going to have a little bit of trouble. You did say that. Right. You did say that. I said that. I mean, I don't know. Bro, I was just. I was about to. You you. I was right about. I was right about Washington. Did you say Washington? Yes, I said. You said. I was watching the. The. Washington is. You the cowboys. I'm going to win the. I said no. Washington is going to make the playoffs. Remember that. I said, Dex. As. Yep. All right. Oh, OK. I should say. OK. No, I mean, I mean, I just feel like it. I mean, there's some things I was wrong, but like all the top of my head, that was just like three things I was right about. I get you that. OK. No, that was right. You was right. You was right on those. I don't know if you were on a Christmas. You was right on the Niners. I was right on the Cowboys. Cowboys in third. You did. I got my one during that. That's what I was right. Good. The last one is. Detroit. Yeah, no. I remember what I remember what y'all. I remember what y'all said. I remember what y'all said in the beginning. You did not say that. I'm not no freaking right. Nobody said I'm not a freaking right. Nobody said I'm not a freaking right. We can go back. We can go back. We can go back. I remember him talking crazy about the Cowboys. I remember him talking about Detroit. Listen, we're going to let him. We're going to review it. We're going to let him do that. You talk about damn. Yikes. You got to calm down a little. Wow. You got that. Sit the way. We're making it for me tough. Oh, man. But I said the 49ers is going to start slow. You said Miami was going to go off crazy. You said two of them might be MVP. That's not what I said. Not this year. That was last year. I said Joe Love. That was last year. Somebody, I just say that. The two of them were last year. I said Jalen Daines was going to be the best rookie quarterback hands down. Right? What else does that say? I mean, I didn't really pick. We were all right about the Chiefs. We all said the Chiefs were going to be the Chiefs again. All right? You were right. Look at you. You ain't had to be like that. That was bad. Like, what are we doing? What are we doing? I showed you love. You was right. Oh my gosh. Go ahead. Keep going. I think we all had our right. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. So where was everybody wrong at though? I was wrong about Jordan Love. I thought the Packers were going to be. Although, technically, I was right about the Packers saying that the Packers were going to be where they're at. But I was wrong about Jordan Love. Jordan Love was definitely in my MVP conversation. You know, I was wrong. I was wrong about Jordan Love. Oh, OK. I was wrong about my Cowboys. In which way? So you was against Jordan Love. I was against Jordan Love. I said I was wrong. That don't mean you're wrong. I think you, I think you. No, I thought Jordan Love was a trend. I thought he was a trend. He was a trend. He hated Jordan Love. Because I was like, I said he's not like that. And I was wrong. I was wrong. He, but is he like that? He's like that. He's like that. Like that in terms of what? Like, what's what you mean by like that? He's right outside the top line. Right outside the top line. OK, but that don't mean like that to me. I didn't have a father like that. OK, now I'm going to in the field. He said he said outside. He said outside. I said right outside. He's like 6'6". He's like 6'7". I got him probably like 7". I'll say this. He'll probably, he'll be in ESPN Top 100 this year. Yeah. I mean, I mean, but that's. I wouldn't just do that. Stop. I mean, that is a hard feat. Stop. Stop. That's why I asked. But that is a hard feat though. No, no, that's why I asked what do you, how you say. Second force is a point. That is what I'm saying. I'm not dispute. I give it those things. I don't think he's the top five for the bed. If somebody was on that hill, I could tell you something. I could tell you what they was wrong. I was wrong about the jets. I was wrong about the jets. I was definitely wrong about the jets. I was wrong about the angles. I got wrong about the scene right here. Pittsburgh. Yeah. I thought Pittsburgh would be nice. I think we all saw Pittsburgh. I'm going to tell you, I got a big one I was wrong about. I said Derek Henry was washed. Yeah, you sure. In the all season. Yeah, he's easy. He's a monster. Listen, this is the thing. We say things. We're going to be wrong about some things. We'll be right about some things. You understand? When you look at the NBA season though, so Natted is shaking out the way he's shaking out. I was saying, he's by that. He's by that. That was about to go on. Just ask what NFL. What we doing? NBA? Go ahead. Natted, you've identified some things that you've identified as right or wrong. Do you think the trends continue though? Now how does it go from this point? I still think it's not a way to halfway point. The choices seem to be. I got one point. Not a way to halfway point. Give me three more predictions. Now that you've seen half a football, three more predictions, you can base it on what you've seen thus far. What's that? Three more predictions. I predict that the Reds, the commanders, continue going well throughout the season. Cowboys continue to diminish. I predict the. Do you hear him? Can they hear you? It's a little like he was just talking to the air. We probably look crazy right now if they can't hear you. You just want to see the speed. What's the third one? You want to see the Cowboys do? You said that one already. I got you. I got you. You gave us two. They were looking for you to give a third one. You didn't give it to me. He didn't say that. He just said it was top three. Yeah, he just said give us your third one. You said Cowboys. You just said that. I'm sorry. I apologize. Don't stop trying to check me. I'm not. So I said, you know what? Bro, you be low key condis. I said stop worrying about what's coming out. Oh, hey. That's what you talk about. All types of wildness. I'm just going to give my three predictions, because I don't want any of this smoke. Because you're talking about it right now. I think y'all coach gets fired. I think. Wait, wait, when fire win. You think end season? Not like right now, but like I think in the latter couple games of the season when it's clearly. Once that X or whatever it is, the Astros for elimination or whatever, I think that I think Baker may feel continues to be whatever the fuck this is that we are watching now. And I think Tampa Bay wins the division. That's in three ways. My trippin and my Mrs. Atlanta. It's Atlanta. And they're not soft. Their record should be. Atlanta's five and three and what's four. Four and four. It could be. OK, so. But I think Baker continues to excel. And I think what you're going to play, I mean, I'm not saying he's nice like that, but I think the Patriots got themselves. Drake, man. They have something of something that they have to at least continue to evaluate. And I think that they I think that they will win more games than they probably want to win. The not being at top two or three to even though they don't need a quarterback to have the ability to trade that pick, you know, God forbid you get one. You know what I'm saying? Then you got everyone trying to get Shador or whoever is the number one quarterback. It may be. And I think I actually think Minnesota comes. I think they fall fall off a little bit. I can't rival Sam Darnold. I just not not for a whole season. So I'm going to go with I think Detroit is the team to beat NFC. Mm hmm. Like full compliment team office and defense. Brings to the anchor that defense, which I think the Eagles messed up because they should have picked them over known Smith, but whatever. And then their office is dynamic, like passing, office of line running, like they got the best office in NFL right now. I think on the opposite side, I mean, no, just keep it in the North, I mean, NFC North, I think three teams in the North will make the playoffs. And the thing is, it could be, it could be all four, but I guarantee they got a picture. So it's going to be three for the beard. I think the beard is, is, there's a beard is a hard out. Like right now they started, you play the bears out of easy out defensively. They got a great defense and then young boy Caleb in that office, he got weapons. So, I mean, so it's not a hard out. So that, and I do believe that if this is what game, three or four, the Nichols out. This is three coming up. Three coming up. So I believe that, no, I'm sorry, this is Thursday, it's not one more. So four years. Next was the week before. I believe that Houston, Texas, when Nicole Collins come back, probably the best team in the AFC. Like Kansas City is playing well, but they're barely winning. I think, I think Houston is going to be the best team in the AFC once Nichols, once Nichols come back. Both predictions. Okay. I'll go, I think Josh out of wins MVP. So dear. I think, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought that was a little, I thought it was a little bit of a time thing. He shot at me. I think I agree with Jerry from Minnesota falling back down the earth. I think, I'll go NFC. I would say, I got, I think, I think Baltimore unceased Kansas City. If I go who the best team in the AFC, if I go, I would probably Baltimore. I think, I think he might deserve it. I don't think they're going to give him another one. I think it's, it's one of those things where it's like fatigue, you know what I'm saying? And I think they are going to look at, oh here's what I think a lot of Josh, what Buffalo six and two, right? I think they're going to look at Josh out in season and say he did it with nobody. If they keep it up, they're going to win the division. Yeah. The division's terrible right now. So they're going to win the division. All right, my three, I think the division is two of his last season in the NFL. I think this is it. Bull prediction. Yeah, that's the ball. I think this is, yeah, I think, I think, yeah, I think he's done. So that's going to change our name in Miami. I think that, I think that if Cincinnati loses, I'm going to say two more games, I don't think Jamar stays in Cincinnati. He hasn't gotten his contract yet. That was already an issue. And if they continue to lose like this, I just don't see why he would want to stay. So I'll be curious to see what that looks like. And then number three, slowly but surely on the low, Bronco sneaking to the playoffs, on the low. Like nobody's paying attention to them. No one paying attention to them, but on the low, they, they, they moving. So I can see that happening and sneak right in there. Yeah, that's a good, that's a good, I got one more. I got one more, I got one more too. We all go with me. Everybody got one more now. There you go. I think that, I think the cheese is going to really, it's going to be ugly. I think they're really, really, really going to flirt with like a long undefeated type, type season. Like I could see them being 14, 15 and old type shit. Like, and resting piece to my man, Mercury Morris, but I wouldn't be shocked if I'm one of them dudes that I like storylines and shit. So I wouldn't be shocked if the year that he, you know, after he passes, that that wouldn't be the first year that we see someone go undefeated. And the only game that I, if I'm looking at this, the only game that looked crazy for them was like, it was like Ant Buffalo. Ant Buffalo versus Houston and the Atkinson. I'm saying he is. I'm saying right now, those three, I don't think my one more, right? Those ain't this, those ain't this. What's up? I think, I think we about to be saying, I'm not, we're right, we're right. We're right, we're right, we're right, we're right. I think we bought the resurgence of let Russ cook. It's about to be here. I'm just saying. Don't let Ryan you say it for real. No, it's not. Does that mean that you put that as the piss, the piss, what they, I think, well, I think Pittsburgh will win the division. You did what it was, 10 and seven? No, I got them, they probably gonna go 12. Listen, here's one thing, one thing for certain, two things for sure. We can, we can disagree about a lot of things. I hope you all disagree with this. J.J. Watt, I mean, T.J. Watt is hands down the best defensive player in the NFL, right? I'm just saying, the best defensive player in the NFL. I think he's the best, I mean, but if someone argued me miles ago, I wouldn't do too much. I mean, I hear you. I hear you. I'm over time for someone. I agree with you. But I, T.J. Watt, he has a knack for making clothes out, please, like, I don't know. I hear you, I hear you, I hear you. I don't know. I mean, he's both, you know, he's playing here. He's playing here. But yeah, I think Russ will, we bought the, we bought the here, starting here in the name again, a little bit. You know what I'm saying? Must have, I was Ryan was here. You know what I'm saying? That's what we must say. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? That was my one more. You got one more, Chris. Yeah, my one more is that I don't see, I don't think San Francisco will win the NFC West. Who you got winning it? The Rams? Right now? I don't see. I'm saying. I mean, if San Francisco, you hurt, I can see it, but like. I mean, I'm gonna say, I don't see, you got, they all, they all four and four. Yeah, but San Francisco is hurt. Nobody else is, everybody's outside the Chiefs. No one's playing more football than San Francisco in the last four years. And like, I think we're just seeing it. That's, that's, that's, that's, I think. I don't always read that. No, I think, I think, I think, I think, me personally, I really think that Arizona is gonna take a step. Now I don't think nobody reckons it's gonna be high. You feel me? I just think Arizona will out, out. I mean, you think Arizona, they gotta win, they gotta win in game. Arizona? I think Arizona won. So I think, here's, here's, here's, that's a, that's a. It's a, it's a, it's a bow, bow. Oh, it was Rams though. Whoa. Oh, it was Rams though. Yeah, it was Rams. I think I, I don't, I don't necessarily disagree with you. It was a hard, it was a hard, but I think, I think you had two opinions that counter-dicked each other. That's right. Who was that? So you said you got three teams from the NFC South, making it right? North, he's saying. North. I did. I don't, I don't see that happening. If the Cardinals win, we're gonna play. I think we're, I think. So my, so that's, so my prediction is that, this y'all don't go to playoffs. My prediction is that, whenever it wins the West is gonna go to playoffs. I disagree with that. That's my thing. Cause the North is going to, they may have three teams in it. I was with it until I did. That's my, that's my, that's my bold prediction. I agree. I agree. Like we, we, we talked about the Purdy in the Purdy ain't Purdy. What do you mean? You just had 300, didn't he just throw for 325, three touchdowns? This, this that's given the game for the, people didn't say it. Wouldn't everybody hurt? What, what gentlemen hurts it like when everybody was hurt? Simply, well, he did it. He didn't play well. He just, he just, he just, he just, he played okay. We got it. We got it. And everybody hurt. I don't want to quote me to that, but we're not gonna do. No, not you. Not, you're good. He said it. What you mean? He said it. Well, we're not gonna do. So he's good cause he said it, but I, I agree. Well, we're not gonna do, sir. Is allow someone. He right at me. Listen. Can I, can I put one of your moves real quick? Give me your top five quarterbacks in the NFL, right? When? Not after, not after this Sunday. That was never in anybody's. Shit, somebody had him too. That was the beginning. Shit. Somebody had him too. It wasn't me. Somebody had him too. I don't have to. Okay. Somebody stood, somebody said, in that chair right there when Chris was not here, I was happening to be sitting right here. You were there. Ryan was right here. Someone had, matter of fact, Chris was here. He was sitting in between the two of you. And I was sitting in between the two of you. Someone had a fucking fit. Because we said there was more than one quarterback in the NFL, better than that press guy. Tell me how that's not saying. He said it wasn't top five. I don't know. The man said he was. I can tell you what I said. I can tell you what I said. What I said was when we went through top five, y'all said Pat Mahon from Josh Island. Then I came in and said, what's the difference between Josh Island? Thank you. Thank you. I said, what's the difference between Josh Island and that press guy? When it comes to the playoffs, they both choke. This was before all this trash. It was not, no, answer my question. Hold on, hold on. Hold on, hold on. I'm correcting you because I didn't say Dak was a number two. I said that it's funny how y'all think Dak is not even in the top five when he's comparable to Josh Island. It's what I said. That's what I really said. Just to clarify, did I not say that? So then I asked you, do you feel like Dak press guy is better than Josh Island? Who, everyone at the table? Time out, time out. I just let you go. It's my turn. On my skip bail list, you had, it's my turn to speak. Okay? So when everyone at the table said Josh Island was number two, you said, you felt that Dak, we all had Josh at two. Except for one person who was fuming and brought up the comparables. And then I said, so you think that Dak is better than Josh Island? And my man said, you're reaching, you're reaching. You're reaching. You know what? Here you go. You can make, here you go. I know what happened. You're reaching. You didn't mention that Josh Island part at all. You just said Dak was number two. He gotta be accurate if you wanna quote me. You know what I'm saying? But I'm gonna be accurate with it. So, I said Josh Island and Dak were comparable. This was leading up to that. No, absolutely, I can't. I'm not, I'm be realistic at the end of the day. He's playing like trash. Is that press got a top five course? No. He not even top 10 right now. You get a foot down twice, the same foot, 10. No, it's got to be two feet, no. Damn. Twice that he can score a touchdown with good. Unless it counts a football move. You get one foot in twice? If you can do it as a, if it's one foot, if it's called, if they say it's a football move, then they count it. He got a touchdown. That's not a football move. You can make a football move. So he got two touchdowns, but don't have no touchdowns. He ain't saying it can be passed, yeah. He got two touchdowns, but don't touch the ground. All right. He's gonna go for a better. See, you must have the whole job. Let's talk about it. I messed up. Everyone stopped and watched the George. They couldn't make it. What'd I do? Don, none of y'all clearly want to. You can't make me argue about Dallas. Don't make me not argue about it. I don't want to argue about it. There's no argument to be had. What's your way of arguing? Y'all should talk. I don't know y'all just play. You should get your shit off. No, no. I just asked you to get top off for best. It's so confident when the Eagles win a game. Go ahead. I'm supposed to not be confident. Who's that? Who's saying it was a shit? Yeah, I'm confused. You're not supposed to be confident. I'm a two. Hold up. How many wins y'all got? We got five. Which y'all got? You must not be. I get you not qualified to talk about this. Qualified? Which y'all got two wins? See, here's the thing, Jerv. I'm gonna be honest with you. When we lose, I don't mind coming to a podcast and talking about it and owning it. When y'all lose, y'all even show up to the freaking podcast. Like, then it just disappear when y'all have a bad game. Then there's only when the game, let's just say it was a Monday night game. Would you be here if the Eagles come in late? Can I ask you this? Can you answer my question first? I'm about to answer your question, good brother. I'm gonna answer your question. I'm gonna answer your question. You cool? Can I answer it now? Because you look good. You low-height. Because you look like you're not your height. Every Monday, I ask Don, is this the Monday Chris is gonna be at the podcast or not? If Don says, only reason I showed up the day, because I didn't think Chris was gonna be here because Chris week would have been last week. Yeah, would be. But there was no show. Only reason I definitely showed was because Ryan said he was not gonna be here. So, however, no matter what happens this weekend, let me tell you again, like I told you two weeks ago when you said this same shit, when you said the same shit, let me tell you, I will not be here next Monday. However, I will be here the following Monday. Now, here you go. Here's the thing. He won't. That's my point. We'll play. We'll play. We like to watch it. I don't, here you go. I don't watch games with the Eagles fans. I'm damn sure not about to watch games with people that don't want my team to win. I don't even watch it with people that want my team to win. I like watching by myself. Hey, some people are very insecure. I understand. No, some people just like to be by themselves and watch 40 of it. It's safer that way. I'm saying we don't come to the Eagles play. Yeah. Because we like to watch. So I'm getting it. I'm kidding. I just want to know that. I'm getting a little bit of just that Eagles fans are really confident right now. This is going to be a little bit of a run. You want to hold the hope. OK. No, no, no. Ask me about the Eagles. Ask me about the Eagles. Here you go. I have a realistic Eagles conversation with you real quick. I said, no, you. I said, when AJ Brand, you was in here like, I got you. Don't cut his shirt. Like, nigga, you was talking big shit. Because I heard you say, nigga, we about to lose. This was. Hold on. I got you. I got you. I got you. Now, I've given my weekly predictions however many times it's a separate one week. I probably have picked the Eagles lose at least three times. Right? So there's no homerism there, sir. Now, what I'll say is that if you ask me about my squad, I think the defense is playing better. They're not playing as an elite defense, but they're not playing as a bottom feeder. They're middle of the pack. And that's cool for right now. I like the improvement. I like how Nicoby Dean is getting better. And I think that with my man, Darius Slay, being injured every other play. And then what I was putting, Koop, is. I said it wrong. That's not who I'm. That's not who I'm talking about. I'm trying to say Cooper being put in the slot. That's what I was trying to say. Cooper being in the slot has really helped out the defense. Right? And I think that Jaylin Hertz right now is playing better football. They're stills. We have offensive line issues. Right? We have a coach issue still because he's a buffoon and special teams. And it's cool. But bottom line is I'm not sitting up acting like we. My man just said the Lions are the best team in football. We didn't say that the Eagles, no one had. Keeping it being until you brought. No, that's what he said. Oh, excuse me. I apologize. Until this until you just brought up the Eagles right now and said, oh, I see this. I didn't say I said I'm getting the jickers. But I'm showing you the difference. If this was two years ago, but if this was two years ago, you'd have been hearing equal shit all season. I'm not saying you're not confident. So there's still holes in the team. I'm saying, listen, we are a weak what? Seven, eight. And normally it's a weak like, but this is really the first week where I heard our chest is pumped. That sounds like a good team. That's not my argument. I'm saying this is the first week. So you're asking if we're confident. I would say that I feel healthy. I feel like if our roster goes up against any roster in the NFL, if they're healthy, I feel like we have a chance to beat anyone. And it's not two years ago where I just felt like whoever the fuck it was, it didn't matter. We were beating them. But I think now there's not really too many teams where I'm like, damn, we play them. We can't beat them. I think we have a chance. There's no team that's scared. I mean, they scare me. However, I'm one of them people that goes, it's Detroit, right? Shit happens to Detroit. Shit happens to Detroit, right? Like the fucking ball bounces, supposed to bounce out of bounds, but somehow somewhere when it comes and it blows the ball back in bounds and it stays in bounds against the scuba score for touchdowns or something. Right? Shit happens. So like, I think we could be Detroit, but if I'm not shocked that when we play Detroit, if we were to play Detroit, the Detroit's the favorite. And again, I would fully expect Detroit to go in as the favorite. You know what I'm saying? Fully healthy, fully healthy. Fully healthy. I like our team to say anybody fully, fully healthy. I don't think I don't really think there's not a corner in the NFL that can fuck with AJ Brown. Like, and I mean that like, like, not even trying to talk shit. Like, I don't think there's a corner in the NFL that can fuck with AJ Brown. And I like how the young bull Quinn, Quinn Mitchell is is playing. Keon Quinn, Keon, excuse me. Quinn Mitchell is playing better. He's playing well against number one receivers. You know what I'm saying? So I'm excited about that shit. Like there's no there's no gimmick. There's no, you know, there's no he just happens to pick off passes because, you know, no, he doesn't get kept for shit. Can't get for shit, but you're not going to get shit. He just he go, it's going to be in completion. You prefer wedding because he's not going to pick it off. It's just going to be in completion. But I like our chances against majority of the teams in the NFL. And I think we have an opportunity to be one of the four teams remaining. If all goes well. And once you do that, anything's possible. We doing this. Just good. Is it my other team? Can you take it? Go ahead. On the Eagles. Well, whatever you want, whatever you want to talk, whatever your little hard desires, Daryl. I can't say nothing. I didn't actually didn't even watch our game. I knew I was going to win. I knew I was going to win. Honestly, I honestly knew I was going to win. I do question. I have a question for y'all, though, as Eagles fans. So like, uh, how do you? Well, not just coach, but coordinator. Are you confident? You say even if your team is fully healthy, are you confident in your office or coordinator the way you know? That's just because I know you. I know you're coordinated. That's why I'm asking you. So like when it come down to it, like I believe that also now y'all going to play off. Y'all in the playoffs or now? Because the issue is so both like you have, you have a good team. I get to y'all. Y'all roster is crazy, right? But like your coordinators, like I, your D quarter seems to have like a, like to your point, you're up and playing D better, but your office is still your office. Now Jalen Hurts had a good game, but like, is that going to be consistent? He's probably one of the last couple games, but I got you talking about one specific game. Yes. Okay, I'm sorry. The issue is so. Listen, these are my coordinators. The coordinator called some pretty good calls. It's just, it's Jalen seeing the field. That's, that's my issue. So it ain't, it ain't a plate calling. It's the quarterback seeing the field at times. The issue is for me, pound and like ground and pound, like absolutely. They got to. I think we have to be, I don't think anybody can fuck with it. I think it'd be a run first offense and then pass the bat. Yeah. And we're going to the, honestly, I heard a clip from seriani and he said, and this was after last week when she caught at 176, he was saying we never lose our identity. That was a good game, but we're going to see how each game go. And we don't know if we're going to run the ball. Every time we won last year is we ran the football. Every time we lost one of the pass, walking the NFL wanted to be a passing glorious through the ball around the field. No, if we run, if we run the football first, I don't see nobody, me personally, I don't see nobody in league fucking with us if we run the football first and then pass the ball with having the Voughtay and AJ and then we've got to come back. That's just me. We run the ball with the line that we have to shake off Barkley with Jalen Hertz and then play action off of that and throw it to the receivers. That's what I see. And defensive play much better. And the reason why we play much better is because we're doing things we haven't done since Jimmy Johnson's been in this blizzard. We're in blizzard till this year. So, yeah, there you go. I mean, do I have concerns about Kellen Moore? Yeah, you got to. I do. But I mean, yeah, but what? Yeah, I mean, this is probably the most weapons he's ever had. So maybe here you go. Maybe this is the year he does. Maybe this is the year he doesn't fall short. And this isn't a shot at you. But like if Kyle Shanahan people can tell me that all the shit that I've seen every single year is not about to happen this year, right? One year, it's not going to happen. Most likely one year. Kyle Shanahan will lead a team, whether it's the Niners or the next team, whatever, he'll lead a team most likely to a championship. Right. Why can't you man? I know it'll sting because not, I mean, one of the Eagles and they're also like, damn, well, he can't do that shit for us. I don't think your head goes with that. Your head goes with final and messed it up. I don't think our head. I think one thing we've seen in the last couple of weeks ever since the whole talking to the fans and all that shit. Like, homie, I don't really think he's doing too much to be honest with you. It's just serious. I don't think I think that what was happening because I remember you asked me this also, how do you how can you tell the difference between Sirianne plays and Kelly Moore and I'm like, you know, the same way you can tell a Kelly Moore play, I can tell a Sirianne watch the shit for fucking. I think y'all just have. When it comes to that, I think you just have. I think anytime it's something bad, you're going to blame Sirianne anytime. Well, no, so it's not. So it's not bad. The band, if it's not, it's not the word bad. It's anytime the offense looks stale. It's so. When they do something, I get it. That's not it's not it's not even out of place. It's when they do the shit that that it's when they do the shit that doesn't make them look like other NFL teams, which is like little simple shit like motion. You blame the guy. No, I blame the guy that that's the consistent guy that's here. Whenever the motion, I'm saying, I think I think Kelly Moore has been calling the police. Yeah, I agree. I think everything that I don't know that is the most. And I think y'all just don't like I don't think you let Jalen check out of a lot of stuff, too. That might be part of the problem, too. I might be part of the problem, too. I don't think that either. You don't think Jalen is checking out? I don't. I mean, I'm not. I don't want to say he does not check out because I'm sure he does. I'm pretty sure. But I don't think it's at the rate that you are probably insinuating that he's checking out. And the reason I can say that I can tell the difference between what appears to be a serianity called not maybe maybe a one-off play note. But I'm talking about when it's three or four or five drives in a row and it's past past past or in its no motion or it's QB draw and it's all the same shit that I saw last year in the year before the getting once a super bangles with the shit that you saw deep passes. So I'll say this. I'll say this. I was driving. I was driving. I was listening to the game. I wasn't watching. It wasn't much motion. It wasn't any. They just throw it up to AJ Brown, throw it up to the Vincenzo. Okay. It looked the same. But people will say, oh, that's kind of more as opposed to saying it's the same shit. I agree with you all. I agree with that. He's a difference maker. So I think I think I think and I think all fans to a certain extent have this notion. Right. Like when when the bad when the bad things have you want to blame it on the person who you don't like because it's easier. And when the good things have you went, oh, he did that. What am I saying? Like it was kind of I give it like when when when Mike McDaniels first went to Miami, right? And we would have a sale drop. Oh, because Mike McDaniels left. You know what I'm saying? No, it's the same. They didn't say my brother called the place. It's just he just happened. Yeah, I mean, I hear you. I just think that for Eagles and for the Eagles in particular, like it's like the first year he got here, the office looked very still. It started to and then halfway through the second halfway through the first season, he publicly gives up play calling to my man is now in Indianapolis. Brian Johnson, not a Brian. Shane Stike Stike. He gives up play call. And then the following year, the offense looks completely different than anything we've seen out any other year. That one year look completely different, right? And that was the one year where we knew for a fact he was not in charge of the place. So then last year when you go back to it, we took the play call because Stike Stike and left. Last year they took the play call. No. Brian Johnson was a court. No, OK. So I'm saying. OK, let's, let's, let's, now time out, time out, because you about to get your gifts. Hear me out. Hear me out. Let's, let's be real. Let's, let's, let's be real. What we're not going to, what we're not going to do is we're going to look at this through regular eyes and not be. If there is a quote unquote offensive head coach and a they get an offensive coordinator who is not, has no experience. 99.9% of the time the head coach, no matter who the fuck the offensive coordinator is, is calling the place. It happens everywhere. If it's an advice person, if it's a defensive guy and the defensive coordinator comes in and he's never been a defensive coordinator ever before, the head coach is the one controlling the defense. The guy is learning. That's what happened with Brian Johnson. And in fact, the shit was being said that, damn, we don't even know Brian Johnson is really even good because we don't know what was his and what was not his. We just know that this offense that we saw last year looked very similar to the offense before stiking. So here took over my only rebuttal. I mean, I'm not tripping on what I live for the off here and I, I'm, I watch these. I mean, you're a little jaded. I am a little jaded. All right. So, so here's the thing, right? So when you see, we watch football, we all watch football, right? When you see somebody call plays. What are they doing? They're going to cheat and doing this. You don't see that from Nick Sarian. So unless it's motherfucking. So, so, so. No, no, no. I'm out. Okay. So I'm not. I'm not saying so. So hear me out. Hear me out. No, no, no, no, no. No, because you made it. You made a good point, right? He's not sitting there with the board. So let's break that down. Prior to the game, they go over the game plan. Nick Siriani runs, not this year, I'm saying last year with Brian Johnson. Kelli Moore has experience, so he's not gonna be as hands-on with Kelli Moore, at least I would think. Brian Johnson has no experience. He runs through different scenarios and tells Brian Johnson, in these situations, these are the plays that I want you to choose from to what you call it. Each situation, the head coach will let, if the head coach is like, yo, not run the ball, the office court are now asked to run the ball. If the, you know what I'm saying? So he may not, so it's like this. This is what, so to your point, this is what it is, right? It's your playing Madden, you go into the formation. Three plays pop up on the screen. That is the three play or Madden suggests is your plays, right? The offensive play to run. There'll be three plays up on the board. That is what Madden is telling you. These are the three plays. Now, obviously it's a little different. You can scroll and shit like that, but that is what it is. He has three or four plays. These are the plays that Sirianne would want you to run in this second and four at this field position, at this point in the game. So he may get to pick the play out of this small window, but that window is created by the guy that's the head coach. In this particular case is Sirianne. I mean, I know, I get it. I hear you and I listen. You say he's creating a friend. He's the head coach. Pull up the week schedule. Can we talk about the same friend in Dallas, Dave? No. What you want to talk about? Dallas ain't shit and the same friend really. Like, we're really the most hated team, bro. No, you're not. No, really rap. Really rap. You couldn't get through this show without saying something. Because I was talking about this scene. He was Dallas's baby with R.G. That's the topic. Yo, that's the thing. He's not the same friend in Dallas every year. I mean, that, that, that, that, that, oh yeah. I mean, get your shit on. But like that, that, that, that. No, that's really not a robbery, right? But like, the same way y'all just sat here and said, if we help you, we can be anybody. I think we help you. We kill everybody. Let's keep it funky. I don't think this year. We got the most injuries in the league and we still average the most points per game in the league. But let's not, let's not get you. We got 24 points in Detroit. 28 points. Well, not after, not after this game. But 28 points per game is what we average. This is without the, the reigning player of the year. This is out B8. It's without kiddo miss two games. Deebo miss one game. So we get healthy. Nobody's fucking with us. I'm like, you know that now I'll tell you upfront. If we, if we would smash off, we'd help Sam. Smash or laugh. You know what I'm saying? Let's keep it funky. Y'all can talk about this shit. You're not helping. I can't say that. My nigga, yo, y'all hold on. We're not helping. No, this is, see this, see this. See this, this is, tell him. Tell him, I'm not for nothing. This is what he does, right? I agree, I agree. Remember two weeks ago when I told y'all I didn't, I wasn't trying to talk about like the Eagles and San Fran or whatever, cause I knew San Fran was better than this. And he was pushing them buttons that day. He saw me in fucking Franklin. All this shit. And all this, yo, if we motherfucking, same way we smashed y'all last year, nigga, we smashed y'all two cars, two years before. Everybody always wanna talk about, everybody, it's not our fault. We put your quarterback out. We hurt your quarterback. You block him with a tight end. We just said we're fully healthy, right? We're fully healthy. And two, when we were both healthy, you were happy what I'm saying, man. When we were both into the question, it's a simple question. It's a simple, when we played the game fully, you know what happens. Here you go, get healthy and play us this year and we can see what happens. Well, I'm sorry. I don't, I can't worry about next year I'm in this year. Cool, I don't think, I don't think, I don't think, I don't think, I don't see y'all winning the championship. Y'all motherfucking got your, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't bet it. I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't bet it in championship. You bet it. Well, I know I'm only, I'm barking with you because you wanna talk that talk and I'm here. I said, no, stop, stop, stop. I didn't ask you anything. Listen, listen, I'ma go to the homer because he just said bet that they won the championship. How much? You know what I'm saying? Bitch, you know what I'm saying? No, that's not what he said. That's not what he said. You see, I went fuckers back, had it like the raw read, so you called me, cut it out. I said, I'm not scared of y'all winning the championship. You said bet it. I ain't scared of y'all winning the championship. No, no, no. What the fuck is he saying? What is he saying? I said, I said I'm not worried about y'all winning the championship. You said bet it. So bet it, nigga. How much? How much? Talk your shit now. How about this? Talk your shit now. Here you go. Because I don't like how you, I don't, so I'll imagine bet, nigga. How much? Bet, bet, bet, it's the bet is this. Either we're gonna win or y'all gonna win. I'm not a nigga, because I already said I don't think we're gonna win. Okay, well then, here you go. I'm not the one that said, if you said, I don't say anything. You would shoot loud. I'm not playing off the ground. You jumping at my maids and I'm not really feeling it. So I'm here. He's not here. I'm here. He's not here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here to you. You're talking. I'm talking to you. Hello? If you said to me, I don't see seven cents for winning the championship. I'm not giving y'all that. I was saying, you said bet it then. But that's what you said. My maids did not, my maids did not say bet it. He did not say bet it. He did not turn his hand to that side. That's what he said. He did not do that. He did not do that. I will back my words. I'll be here better looking at y'all. I'll be here better looking at y'all. I bet you we'd play all we beach y'all. I'm saying that not knowing who the fuck's gonna be on the field. Oh my God. I told you, see I wasn't going there, but I told you from Rip, I felt this would be an off year for you guys. You guys have played a lot of football. It's Christmas and Christmas. That's a big if. I don't think he's coming back home. What's the point of making that? What's the point of making that? I'm just saying. I don't think I don't think. You just said if we play, if we play, I don't care who's on the field. But I just said in Christmas time, we bet y'all. Tell me, do you hear yourself? Hear what I said. I said, I'm down to. No, no, no, bro. I don't. You're the, and I just said. I do. Because who on the field makes it different? Okay, so you over here making something. I'm back better than what I don't want to call you out. And said, yo, we gonna bust that. And you said, well, she is healthy. And I'm like, I don't care who's on the field. Cause y'all healthy and we're not. I get it. How are we healthy? Dallas Goddard's not on the field. Dallas Goddard on the field. Oh, come on, bro. We didn't have, we didn't have either tackle. We didn't have a whole, we didn't have a left tackle. Oh, right tackle. We not, we're crying and complaining about that shit. I'm not crying at all. Damn. I just said, I, we're not crying at all. Ain't nobody tell, ain't nobody tell y'all to put y'all, all y'all eggs in a basket up or running back to get hurt every year. Y'all laughed it up, was doing that with us. And I said, we gonna get them this year. Next year, all of these different. Let's pray, say, Kwan, don't get hurt. And then let's see how, here you go. Well, that's all he's in prayer. Let's pray. I'm praying with me, man. I'm praying, praying with me. I'm placing the date check, go get real. Pray with me. Yes, it will be different. But right now, that's what it is. What the fuck is the difference? What I'm saying? I'm telling you, CMC can be on the field or he cannot, we will bust that ass this year. I disagree. Okay, bet it. Here you go. Bet it. If we help the, if we help the, if we play y'all, I don't care who's on the field. That's the risk I'm willing to take. CMC was going to be on two years ago when we played. Hold on. You had a quarter bit? You were gonna feel it. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Real quick, real quick, real quick. Why you going back to two years ago? You brought it up. No, I didn't. Go back to the last time we played. You said last year. Go back to, that was last year. Why did you? That's the last time we played for $1,000. That's the real, that's the real. That's the real. Like I said about $1,000. It wasn't nothing for me to say if I doubted we'd beat him every year. Yeah, I'm not hearing you. Let me talk with you. What was I supposed to say? I'm playing. Cool. Okay.
