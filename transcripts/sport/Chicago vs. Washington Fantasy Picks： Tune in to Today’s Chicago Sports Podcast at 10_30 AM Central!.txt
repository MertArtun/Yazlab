 Yeah. What's up everybody? Hello, Chicago. Thank you for joining us. Early edition of Sunday Morning Munches of Madhouse. Brought to you by Chicago Sports Podcast's favorite sponsor, Bridges Corbboard, your Northwest Indiana Sports headquarters with the coldest beer in Chicago land and the best food in the biz, man. Come check us out today at 2 o'clock. We're going to be doing a pregame podcast. We're going to be giving away a 55 inch television. A lot of free giveaways. Trivia, we got some trivia going on, like five questions about the game, the current game. We're going to be having a lot of fun up there. So come break bread with Chicago Sports Podcast. I'm your boy Brandon Trax Hyatt. I'm here with Brandon P. and Darius, the Lock Lockhart. How are you guys doing this morning, fellas? Doing good. Everything's good, man. Everything's good. Ready to roll, man. How do you guys feel about this Washington game, man? How are you guys feeling? I'm charged up, man. I'm ready to go. I feel like I'm getting ready to suit up at 4.30. We might need you. We might need you, brother. Hey, man. If you're as intense on the field as you are on the set, man, we're going to win. We're sure. It's a lot of talk going on, man. What year? What's out there? You know, just some of these people saying that, you know, we didn't do our due diligence kind of doing the draft process. You know, just a whole bunch of crap, man. And I know what I've seen when I watch these games now. No team pays me, you know what I'm saying, to scout anything like that. But I think I know the game is good enough to know better, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, for sure. What are you hearing out there, Brandon? I mean, pretty much the same thing. I think we made the right decisions. I'm not really worried about it. You know, you could see what's being produced out there. So I'm pretty comfortable where we're at. Definitely exciting for this game. You know, a win is always nice. And we want to keep rolling with that. So pretty excited. Yeah, I am too. And I'm excited about the fact that, and I kind of go back from the goat, this goes to, you know, I'm going to date myself, the Michael Jordan era, where he always wanted to play against your best. He used to talk trash, and he wanted you at your best, because he wanted to beat the best version of you. No questions, you know, no questions, and no excuses at all, you know? And that's kind of where I'm at today, man. I want the best version of Jaden Daniels. I want him out on the field, and I want to kick him in his teeth and hit him in his ribs. Let's go. But yeah, I think it's going to be a good game. I'm really excited about it, man. It's a pleasure and honor to have you guys on the set. Harris is always looking slick. I like your, is that a crucial catch hat? Nah, nah, this is a hat I got like maybe a year and a half ago. OK. It's just no color. Yeah, it's just a color wave, you know what I'm saying? Situations. Yeah, I got mine on from last year. Buddy of mine gave it to me at a tailgate. I said, hey, nice hat. He just handed a right to me on mine for real. So that was pretty cool, man. Brandon, I like your number two. You got over there, bro. That's awesome. Yeah, yeah. I want to see him show out today. Yeah, I think no matter what his numbers are, I really feel like he will. And I think he's going to do a good job. What do you guys think his numbers are going to be? While I'm sharing our podcast, I got my head down. That's what I do. Once we go live, I can start to share to a bunch of other Facebook groups. So please forgive me, but piggyback off of that question and kind of talk between each other. I'll be done in just a second. For us, his numbers, DJ Moore. Yes, sir. If I can guess, I don't think he's going to be overloaded like he was last year with over 200 plus. I don't think that's going to be the case, because we have so much around him. And I'm sure the Washington defense is going to be keying on him because he had such an explosion last year. I feel like the wealth is going to get spread around pretty well. I do too. As far as DJ Moore out, 60, 65, anywhere from 65 to 80 yards in the air, a touchdown, I feel like. About that, Brandon, are you similar? Or do you think he's going to have a little bit more? Or what's going on? Well, I mean, what we've been seeing is Kayla's been giving everybody the ball. But I'm thinking DJ is going to do a lot better. I'm thinking he's going to get two touchdowns. He's going to get 100 yards, at least, with everyone else producing around him as well. But I think, in my opinion, he's going to be the all-star in the field. Well, just for the listeners that weren't here and me out the other day, I like to reference a lot of things to food. And I feel like food and our sports have a lot in common. That's why tailgates go off. And there's such a joy to be at. So when I was growing up, a lot of boys in the house were all sitting down. And mom always told me, make sure everybody's got a plate. And we're going to seconds. Make sure everybody's full. And then you get into thirds and whatever. Obviously, I had some of them, too. But pay attention to everybody else around you, because we don't want anyone to not go without. And you go with more than your share. And I think that's kind of where Caleb's at right now, man. He's in them shoes where he's got a lot of mouths to feed. And it ain't just one like Darius said last year, where I've got a select few that I could feed early and often. But mama might have a little extra big crock pot or something today. She might be cooking up a little extra. And you never know who it's going to be. Guy falls down. DJ breaks ankles. I kind of agree with Darius. I could see exactly where his logic is at. But I do, I am anticipating potentially something above and beyond that just in a streaky situation or something were to happen. I wouldn't count it out. But if it doesn't happen to where he exceeds high limits, I understand why. If that makes any sense, that's where I'm thinking. And I think we can all touch and agree on that. And that's a good problem to have, right, boys? Because forever, we've always been just a Brian or a locker or what I'm trying to say or I'm getting at, where you have a few guys. But then if a guy needs to go out for a little bit, who do you have to replace? I feel good. I feel good about our squad. It's deeper. It's getting deep. After three years, I think Pohl's put together a really good product. And yeah, boys, I think today is going to be a really fun, interesting game. I'm really excited about it. It's going to be one of that for the ages. There's only been a handful of times where a first round pick and a first round second pick picks one and two that are quarterbacks matched off since the beginning of the Super Bowl era of 1967. And that's a pretty interesting feat. To say the least, the NFL definitely knows how to market, right, Darius? They knew what they were doing when they put this on the schedule, brother. Yes, indeed. It's going to be very interesting to see how Washington starts out as far as their defense is concerned, how they look to attack us today. And I think that's going to be the determination on who and where and who the ball goes to. Yeah, I do too. And help us understand a little bit better about what we got out there as far as the defense. Who to look out for, Darius and Brandon. Who's over there in Washington? Because as far as I know, the guys that I knew that were the household names, they're much gone in my mind. So help us out. I know that Kerrigan is gone, right? He's not there anymore. Oh, yeah. Right. Well, you have. That's with us. This is a revenge game. Let us know who we got for the listeners out there, please, bro. Well, you got a Hall of Famer, Bobby Wagner. Let's not forget about him. Let's really start on the sideline. And you know what I'm saying? Super Bowl appearance with the coach, as far as he went. He was with the Atlanta Falcons. I lived here in Atlanta. Had the defense born very well. But Dan Quinn, very aggressive defense coordinator. He asked me on studs out there, but they're young. But the audience was late. Darius, is that what's going on right here? Is this a class case of where a coach can help elevate players that we might not typically know, and they can actually play at a higher level than what we think they are? And they slide in and do damage that we're not ready for? Is this potentially what could be happening there? I wouldn't say that. But his experience and him being one of the top coordinators at this time of the game does make a difference. He does understand football at a high level. And he's been very successful. He was successful with the Dallas Cowboys with the same aggressive defense scheme. But we all understand that it comes down to the players. We have the guy in the middle. He's a Hall of Famer, Bobby Wagner, former Seattle Seahawk. He's one of the perimeter guys that plays middle lineback in his league. He's the leader of this squad. And he's surrounded by a bunch of youngsters. He got St. Jude's and Forbes, as far as the corners are concerned. But those guys, St. Jude always finds himself in good situations most of the time. But he still ends up getting beat by better players. I don't like it. I'm bad with these guys last night or sometime. No, you're good. Let's just talk about positions for now. I understand. The defensive ends, they can't get to the quarterback, especially with Dan Quinn's listen style. Number 99, he's a young guy, very aggressive. He knows how to turn the corner, get to the QB. Now, we understand that they're missing the top defense of tackle, the leader of that front line with the pet. Is it a torn pet? Yeah. I believe it's all I heard was chest. So yeah, Peck, yeah. OK, yeah, so missing him. But they still have some young guys in that middle that's saying, hungry to make a difference. OK, OK. What do you think? What's your take on all that, Brandon? Who should we be looking out for on the defensive side? I know the offense gets a lot of love, but is that defense something that we need to look at? I mean, I was just going to piggyback off of what he said about Bobby Wagner. Basically, that's the only person I could think of. I don't really follow that team too much, and I really haven't been doing my homework this week, honestly. So I can't really say too much about that other than just Bobby Wagner. Well, I think that's fair. That's a fair statement, because a lot of us know how high-powered that offense is over there, and it's something that you spend so much time on, and you don't look at all the other stuff. I mean, let's be honest. How long did Darius, how long did Rodman fly under the radar while on the bulls with Jordan and all his awesomeness? There's some players that eventually you're like, oh, wait, hold up a minute. You're like, I'm not going to be able to shoot your life. So all these sort of things. And who's that little like-eyed that keeps passing the ball to the mailman? So Stockton. It's just things like that that pass us by, and when you start to look at these teams, and they're starting to build momentum, and you're like, hold up now. It can't be just that's cooking it. There's got to be something more to it. I'm excited to see this team see what it is, because at the end of the day, Jaden Daniels and Caleb, in a lot of people's minds, is going to be around for a very long time. And to that point, I want everyone to kind of focus on something. We could be very well a part of greatness, something that's going to be around for a decade plus on both sides. It's been a while since we've had some really great QBs and a really good QB draft. So let's just enjoy the moment and kind of marinate in it, getting back to my food analogies, and be happy that we have some great players out there. Don't get caught up in, should we? Should I cut a wood? I got Jaden over Caleb. Get the fact, get it right, that we got one of the two in the building, and let's celebrate and not tolerate the fact that we got who we got. And enjoy all the other parts on the team, too. Don't be so focused on the QB. A lot of people do that. There's a lot more players who we witnessed just the other day when we were blessed to have Earl Ochre on this set. And you guys right away, Bobby Wagner, linebacker, don't forget about him. He's on the team. He's a field general. He's basically like having a coach on the field. Is he the same as who he was? None of us are as we age. But what happens? Because of repetition, we get smarter, and we don't have to work harder. So expect Bobby to go out there and be that guy that elevates others around him. Because that is a true definition of somebody that is great. It's not just elevating yourself. It's elevating people around you. So I do want to get into some fantasy football. If there's anything else that you guys would like to talk about, let's chop it up really quick. Let's really quickly, I would like to hear your guys' predictions. For those out there, there might be a couple that don't know that Darius and I are pretty much locked in this week on the same dang score. But I did change it around a little bit the other day for you, Darius, or Marriota versus Jaden. But it looks like Jaden is playing. So I'm just going to lock back in on that one. So but let's start off with Brandon. Let's hear what his prediction is. My God, it's winning 24 to 14. 24-14? OK. That's 38 points, right? So that would be the under on today's. I think the spread was 43, I think, or somewhere around there. So you're calling for a close defensive game. And but we'll score 10 more points. That's interesting. And you know what? I think I saw Darius, if I'm not mistaken, another one of our guys or listeners in the comment section had a very close similar score too. So I'm interested to see if that actually happens. And I'm not surprised if it does. What about you? It could. Like, I don't really care what the score is. Be honest with you. I just want to win. Clothes. Is there any weather conditions out there, Darius? Do we have any wind or is it cold out there right now? Have you guys looked at it? No, I haven't taken a look at it. But it's in DC. And this time of the year, it's, you know, thin temperatures are starting to creep down a little bit. You know, I'm sure it may not be 80 degrees like it is here where I am. But I told you, I told you, I'm rubbing that in. Mr. Top is over there. But I'm sure, you know, as long as it's mild, hopefully we don't have to worry about any of the elements. But still, hey, man, it's football, baby. A special shout out to the guys in the chat, especially John, who's lighting it up, man. John, I think I might have seen you before. But yeah, welcome back, man. And thank you for being in here. Everybody, hit that like and subscribe. We got over 75 in the chat and one like. So let's get those like buttons and smash the hearts and notifications. Subscribe, you know, you all know what to do, man. We really appreciate you bringing content and hanging out with you guys and want you guys to know that you are a part of the show. You are the show that we do this for you. We don't just do this just to talk amongst ourselves, man. You guys are great. And John, you pretty much, you've got the star for the day, brother. But getting back to stars, let's talk to my man, Brandon. What do you think, buddy? What do you think about today? Do you think that possibly we could elevate past 24? What did you say, 24-14? Or do you think that it's going to be low scoring? And why did you put it that low? I have to come back and ask you that, because I forgot early. I don't know. I feel like if I did predict a higher score, it would bite me. So I just picked something that was more difficult. Yeah, my predictions ain't the greatest, but I have some fun with it. Hey, that's an average game, man. Have fun, man. You know. Have fun with it. Just win, baby. In the mighty words of Al Davis, just win, baby. Right? Right. If we all could predict the future, man, I'm pretty sure. You know, we have a lot of things going on, you know? Yep, yep. Gary Stradamus over there. So listen, I want to get into this fantasy, man, because it's a lot of, oh, wait, hold on a second. We got a odd. This just in. We got a weather report from J2K, man. He's saying sunny, 59 degrees, and a little wind in DC. So I mean, you, at that point, you can still say ice cold beer, but if it drops below 50, don't. Just say cold beer or just say beer. We got to get your beer, get your beer. I remember in Chicago, man, it was a December game, and this guy was saying, get your ice cold beer. And I'm like, bro, your sales are going to be down if you're pushing cold, bro. I was layered up. I filled out like five credit cards applications so I could get a bunch of scars and put it all around me, man. I look like a mummy because I was a knucklehead and underdressed, you know? But the other guy to my left, he was killing it, dude. He had hot cocoa. Get your hot cocoa. Warm up your hands. I'm like, bro, I'll take two of those. So sunny and 59. I think that's really good. You can get a good lather going, some sweat going, but I don't think you're going to get super cold. Like my boss says, there's heat in the tools. So these guys are going to be running hard to stay warm. We got to remember that this is an evening game. It's not a one o'clock game. So those guys, by the time, you know, 5, 30, 60 o'clock, those temperatures are going to creep down a little bit more. For sure. Yeah, because it'll be three o'clock here, four o'clock there. And by the time, Darius said, by the time, you know, that sunset, it's going to be getting dark. And yeah, it's going to start dropping, man, with a little bit of wind, he said. So that wind is more influential when it drops down. So it'll get a little bit nippy, but we got to get used to it, man. That's bare weather, baby. Let's go. The scroll says 37, 17. That's interesting. That's close to what Darius' score is and close to mine. So we're actually right around hovering around 31, 37 to 17, right around that neck of the woods. Bido wants to go to the Daniels playing. And Bido, yes, Jaden Daniels, all reports are that Jaden will play. Nothing has been confirmed, but it looks like he's a go. And one of the lead team staff members on the team said he's a tough son of a gun. So that's good to hear. Let's look forward to seeing that young man play. Yeah, let's see what Keith's got to say. Sounds like he's playing. Washington knows the defense is going to light up either way. Scrolls, Caleb's passes cut through wind like butter. Keith, Jaylen Johnson played Daniels in college. Shut him down. OK, let's get into fantasy, man. A lot of guys are struggling with some picks, most notably one of our guys last night, a guy that Brandon knows really well, had a good question. He had a question about the quarterback for Seattle versus Jaden Daniels. And I always look at those matchups, right? I look at defense, the defense that they have to go against, their health. All that has a little bit to do with my decision. And usually, like my older brother says, when I talk after I'm done, he says, Brandon, start your bench and sit your starters, because that's usually how it works after the game. So that's just how I look at it. Let's get right off the top. This is a guy that Sean, Sean Stradamus, he's really good at making predictions and looking and scouting and whatnot. He's with four stars. We have him on Wednesday nights. Really good, dude. Baltimore Ravens at Cleveland Browns. David Najoku. David Najoku for this season. He has 165 yards. He averages 41.3 per game. He's got one touchdown and 29 targets. Now, Najoku saw a league high of 14 targets last week with Amari Cooper being gone. So that is very important to look at. We were talking about injuries and how they influence your decision-making on who to start and whatever. And we'll let Darius tee off on this in a second. But he gets a big upgrade at QB with James Winston starting. And I'm really looking forward to looking into the fact of James Winston starting. I think he still got some left in the tank, man. I like the guy. Najoku has earned 31% first read target rate over the last two weeks. That's pretty high. And he gets an extreme pass-final defense against the Ravens that have allowed NFL low 51.7 running back rushing yards per game, but the most passing yards this season. Baltimore's opponents have the league's third highest pass rate at 66%. Winston threw a touchdown during his only drive last week. So Najoku is a top three tight end right now. So they're saying by all reports, start Najoku. What do you say about this, Brandon and Darius? Najoku, yeah. I mean, they don't have a whole lot of weapons over there. They're going to be playing some third string wherever seed was over there as well. The quarterback change is really the big thing because Desonant Watson has not been able to move this offense. Like everyone at Cleveland would have hoped. Nick Chubb is back. So that's going to help James out. Or whoever the star QB is going to be this week tremendously. So I mean, for the people who drafted Chubb, this is the time to play him. He scored last week. If I'm not mistaken. So that's all any time your guys that you draft get his own as always a plus. Against Baltimore, he's had decent success against them. But with the quarterback that's playing this week, I think he's going to change things. So Najoku will be James Winston's safety blanket. Like most tight ends are for quarterbacks that's not very it's not in the upper echelon. Hey, Derrick, really quickly back to that running back. I have him and I was going to elevate him. But I talked to Jim Miller about who I wanted to start. Because I have Chubb's or I have JSN as my flex. And he said go with JSN just because Chubb's is now coming out. And it could go either way. But the safe bet is to go JSN who's going against Buffalo. I was a little questioning that decision by Jim Miller. I really wanted to start Chubb's. Honestly, if he was coming off an injury and only had one week behind, I think he would have had a different decision behind that. But what's your thoughts on that, man? Starting JSN over Chubb's, man. I'm going to be honest with you. Seattle's going to throw the ball. That's going down the field. You know, in this particular setting, I would take JSN over Chubb. Because Buffalo's defense has been coming along the last couple of weeks. But when you have a guy like Gino and the offense, they're playing in. Because I don't think, I know DK Metcalf got hurt as well didn't he last week? He was injured last week. Yeah, he did. That's a good listen. That could that's definitely going to boost up on that. There's he might have touched on that. Very smart, very smart counter. I now things are starting to line up. That is a huge part. Yes, sir. Hard to leave out. I'm sorry about that. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. It sure is. You know, so that makes that makes the world of a difference. Last I looked, you know, was leading the league and passing yards too. So we already know what's going on. You know, he's going to throw the football a lot. Yeah. So he's going to need some guy that he's going to need to, you know, I'm saying he's going to need to lean on the guys that he's familiar with. JSM North and as well, you know, look out for that one. That tight end. OK, OK, Brandon, I want to tap in really quick. What's your thoughts on this starting, you know, the. You know, no, Joe Koo is that you think that's a smart move, especially with the Rocky position there in with, you know, switching quarterbacks and Amari Cooper and all that? I really don't follow the fantasy. I've never really done it. So I really couldn't answer that question to help you out, honestly. Yeah. You just got to edit all these. I don't really like we've got to like try to go around that when we're alive, because that's that's we're never mind. But at least you're honest. Yeah, but he's he's a good target outside outside. So what we would do is we would think outside of fantasy and just think about the logistics of who is going to get the ball. If this guy is not here, obviously there's going to be more targets. And then, like I said earlier, he got a lot of targets last week. So if they fall suit with that, the logical, you know, the logical guess, it's not a confirmed like we don't know what their, you know, play is, but they potentially would use this guy more because, you know, Cooper's out, if that makes sense, Brandon. Yeah. Yeah. No, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. Anyways, OK, moving forward. Also something to look at. Rashad Bateman looks to become a flex option of Zay flower sits. Zay flowers is potentially out there. Oh, wow. Yeah. I have him on one of my family teams. Well, this is what I want to do the show with you guys, because we've got another 29 minutes before you make your final selection. You've got to make your selection at 1130. This portion has been brought to you by underdog fantasy. Enter the promo code CSP, that Chicago Sports Podcast CSP. The first thousand they match the next thousand. They gave you a 50 percent back. Darius and I, we hop on it all the time. We all get on there and we do pretty good, man. We do pretty good. The minimum that you can place a bet with is $10. So you don't have to throw a lot of money on to win a lot of money. It's a good time. It makes it more enjoyable to look at things outside of the Chicago Bears. Once the Chicago Bears is done, you know what I'm saying? So, yeah, that's a flowers is a big he's been a little blub of a let down this year. Darius, well, he's, you know, there's a change. Schematically, you know, once you add a guy like, you know, a big running back back there, you know, yeah, you know, it's like, can you hear you at him back there? It's going to change. You're going to have to offer your offense, you know, you're going to lean more and toward that direction, but he had a heck of a game. He had a heck of a game against the commanders. You know, he didn't quite get in the end zone, but he was very productive. So, you know, when you have an offense that's predicated to the run like that, you know, you kind of have to take what you get as far as, you know, past catchers and things like that. So you like those are the things that you have to, you know, be aware of when you're crafting players and also the players that you're choosing to play on a weekly basis. Wow. Yeah. You know, to go along with what you just said, Darius Keith just said he stretched thin this week. He's gotten a calf on IR. There's a lot of stuff going on. They're playing musical chairs right now on the freaking Titanic on a lot of teams where they're shipping out and shipping in wide receivers. I mean, you know, that's a premium position because the quarterbacks are the highest price tag in the league and it's a passing league and you got to have wide receivers to catch them ball. So they're going to be the second, you know, highest price tag. And a lot of people are realizing that they need one more target or they got a guy down like this guy does the referee at running back and you got to have receivers in order to take that, you know, take all that into consideration. So, you know, Keith said problem is what wide receiver do they got? They are going to crowd the box on chubs. So that's where, you know, we were talking earlier about going to that tight end because you got to have somebody, you know, he's also said Higgins, Echler, but I'm not playing Echler versus Barris D. Now they do have Jerry, they have Jerry Judy. They have Jerry Judy. Oh, he's not listening. He's not a hollow. He's not one of these super great names. I mean, he had a great name coming out of Alabama, out of Alabama, but he's production hasn't matched the height that he had. Also, a quiet guy, you know, he's not very, you know, he don't jump off the screen a lot of times either. But playing with James Winston or any of the backfubs, he have a great rapport with him. That's Elijah Moore. You know, he's good for a lot of stuff underneath. Now this is the NFL and all of these guys are great at something. Right? Yeah. So, you know, going to this game, you know, these defenses, you know, you have to respect, you know, if you don't respect these guys, they'll burn you. Yes. You know what I mean? So I'm sure they may start off in the eight man box or whatever, but if you get beat down that scene, but no, if you'll change that. Be kind of seeds. John just brought a really good point up to us. Darius Terry McClaren. And he has on fantasy league and he has zero games this season under 50 yards. He moves around a lot and Cliff will put him in favorable matchups, avoiding Jalen. John, I, you're, I hope you make it to all of our fantasies, man. You're killing it right now, buddy. Thanks for being there, man. We really need you in the chat, man. I appreciate you, man. And he's absolutely right. He's absolutely right. They're going to move McClaren around because you have to try to avoid, you know, him getting under the shadows of Jalen Johnson. And the way that Cliff, Cliff Kingsbury offensive ran is a lot of, you know, east to west, you know, a lot of drag routes. You know, now if we, if the quarterback breaks contain and gets loose out there, you know, that could be an issue as well, because that makes you susceptible to deep balls, you know? So he's absolutely right. Now, John has a very important question and they're all trying to make their picks. We'll try to get through these as quickly as possible. I do want to ask Brandon a quick question about Montgomery, because that's the next player we'll target. And we have a lot of information of Montgomery since he was a, you know, prior bear and Iowa football player, Iowa State. John has a question. He says, I am five and two in fantasy league facing another five and two. John, I'm the reciprocal of that. I'm very jealous of your five and two. Battle for first place. That's awesome. He's starting per, perty over JD five this week. JD five. What's that? Uh, that's a Jaden Danes. Oh, so maybe the five is a, it's number. Oh, okay. Or RB, uh, should he start a Hubbard or Stevenson? He's thinking Stevenson. Um, okay. Now this is what I don't know. Who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, the Patriots playing against this week. Okay. Uh, uh, Keith, who are the Patriots up against this week? Or was, no, that was John's question. I'm sorry. Knowledge, knowledge on team. Hey, thanks for coming back, brother. He'll, he'll answer. Uh, Travis Homer is our fullback outside the red zone. Our goal packages, I would guess that's interesting because I almost gave up against, uh, Travis. And now that I know that he's our fullback and we released our fullback in the Blaston game, which I thought was a decent guy. Uh, that, that's interesting to know. Thanks for giving us that knowledge, knowledge. Uh, Keith said, he definitely told me something. Really? I mean, it's possible. I did see him punch one in a few weeks back and I was kind of wondering like, he's actually in on our team. You know what I mean? Oh, he said the Jets. He said the Jets is who they're up against. Uh, just, uh, now remember Remandre Stevenson lost. He lost, um, he lost a bunch of carries because he has a family issue. Take that into consideration. Um, and he was injured, but he had more, he had probably, um, ball security, um, within the last couple of weeks as well. And Remandre, he said Remandre Stevenson versus who? Uh, hold on, hold on, hold on. I think it was, uh, the running back for, uh, Hubbard, Hubbard. Oh, Chubba, Hubbard, uh, that Carolina situation. And they're back, they're back to the young fella. They drafted too. So. Pretend crew checking in. What's up, Dan? Oh, I got my hat on backwards this day. I'm going to turn it around because it's a crucial catch that anyways, um, at a respect for you and your crew, Dan, which I was a part of. Um, let's get into this. Uh, somebody said all noon game sucked this week. Uh, that's a possibility since the Bears are playing at three. I'll have to say yes so far. Getting back to, uh, David Montgomery, Brandon. Um, interesting tail. I never really wanted to go. He's got my favorite number five on his jersey. Really good guy. He's got 382 yards this year, average and 63.7. That's pretty good when you're considering a timeshare and you're looking at somebody in the red zone to punch it in and he scored on average up until last week. One touchdown a game. So maybe they gave that guy a little break since he was banged up the week before, but, uh, he's averaging an over four point yards, which is huge. That's a lot. I like that. Uh, yards per catch is six and 21. Oh, no, no, six touchdowns. I'm sorry. Six touchdowns. I was like 21 touchdowns, uh, 20, uh, six touchdowns. And as long as a 21 yard. So, you know, I, I, he's, he's been at practice this whole week, Brandon. And you know, that guy's a workhorse. He works hard. I think even if he's a little banged up, like Brian says, a real player's play, right? So, um, the Titans aren't an easy run defense though, but the Lions ran for 144 yards against a tough Vikings D last week. So that's encouraging for them, right? Um, not encouraging for us. Uh, James, Jameson Williams is out and the Lions have the league's highest implied team total of 28 and a half points, man. Uh, this week, Detroit is also the biggest favor with 11 and a half on the board. So I think it's a favorable, you know, especially starting against, uh, starting Mason Rudolph and likely missing both of its top wide outs. I think that you would start Montgomery. Wouldn't you agree? Even if you, he's not your go-to Cowbell, he's still, you know, look to have a lot of yards. Wouldn't she say Brandon? I would think so. He's a workhorse, man. Yeah. Yeah. Matt doesn't matter, man. Yeah. And go, you know, I know he's turned, he turned his ankle last week. If I'm not mistaken too. But I think he's good to go. You know, we all know David Montgomery is a soldier, man. He's gonna get out there no matter what, unless you know, unless the limbs missing or something like that, he's ready to play. Now here's an interesting factoid guys. Moving forward, the Lions defense is a top three to start this week. So keep your hands to your hats in case you got him out there. If he's in or that's in the free agency or you got a, uh, Deion by moving forward. CJ Stroud, man, unbelievable character, really good talent, dual threat QB. Uh, so far he's got 1,663 yards this year. He's averaging 23 and a half, uh, yards, 66% completion. He's got 10 touchdowns and a QB rating of 94.9, man. Yeah. And for John, I'm sorry to interrupt you, try for John. I'll go with you. I would go with hover this week. Oh, okay. Go with Hubbard. Uh, Stroud will continue to miss, uh, Nico Collins, man. That's a huge, huge loss, but he's in a good spot to bounce back from one of the worst games of his career last week. Stroud has gotten 8.7 yards per average and 311 passing yards with 22 total touchdowns over 11 games during his, uh, career at home. So he also owns a six TD, uh, to zero interception ratio over three games versus Colts and those matchups like Darry said earlier matters. So they've also have allowed the fifth most schedule adjusted fantasy points to get back to season. So I'm looking forward. If you got him out there, start Stroud, make it, make it happen. Put them on, put them on the board. I don't think we need to say anything more about that. It pretty much speaks for itself. Well, I mean, let me, let me, let me jump in for a second. Um, remember game, uh, there's, we got like 20 less than 20 minutes to get through all these guys. Okay. I'm trying to skip through some of them, but get to the ones that we might need to go back and forth about. Um, please forgive us guys. This is like our second fantasy, like right before picks on Sunday. Well, so we're just ironing kinks out. Uh, Green Bay Packers against the Jacksonville deck. Jaguar is very important game for us. I'm hoping Jacksonville can sneak one in because I want the guys from up north to lose. I'm not saying that it's going to happen. I'm just wish thinking they are saying to start Romeo dowels. And I'm thinking that this is very interesting because I was thinking about that other receiver that's been hot lately, but they're saying start Romeo dowels, he's got 312 yards this year. Uh, and, uh, 52 yards average, 34 targets, 23 receptions and two touchdowns. What do you say about that, uh, Darius? Yeah. Diles has been coming on the last couple of weeks, but I know you're talking about Reed, Jen Reed. Yeah. Jaden Reed. Yeah. Jaden Reed, I'm sorry. Yeah. He's been, he's been there guy all year, but, um, going up against Jacksonville, you can't go wrong, man. They give up a lot of big plays. Yeah. Yeah. I actually, they allow the most for outside receivers. So you're, you're a hundred percent agree about that. And, uh, even if one cooks, it's possible both could cook. You know what I mean? So that goes to kind of piggybacking into that. I would say also start Jordan love too. I remember Sean was saying start, I think it was at least 250. If not 260, I could be mistaken. I have a screenshot of who Sean thinks to start on underdog fantasy. Maybe you could pull that up. Uh, Darius, I'm not sure, but I know that that was in our, uh, group chat. But, uh, that, that seems logical. If anything we can hope for a dog fight with high points and potentially, I don't know, the Jaguars ride hot and win. That's, I mean, it's just, what do you think, Brandon? You think there's even a shot at this or no? Oh yeah. Jaguars the one in. Okay. Cool man. I like it. That was nice and easy man. Appreciate you man. That's going to be a fun, that's going to be a little funky game. Because the Jacksonville can move the football. They just, they just vary inconsistent in office. He's very just sent me a screenshot of who he's got on his bench. Uh, it's his, he's, you want to know what his team name is this. Now this is not me speaking. I'm just reading. Okay. This is Keith. Can I tell him what your team name is? I'll wait. I'll put a pin in this. Uh, Jaden, uh, Jaden waddle is the next guy we're going to talk about boys. Uh, Arizona Cardinals at Miami Dolphins, the deserts, the desert cardinals go down there into my, into Miami. Uh, so right now, what's that? It's going to be a shootout, man. It's going to be a shootout. Okay. Okay. 269 yards. Jaden waddle, 44.8 average, 30 targets, 22 receptions, zero touchdowns. What do you guys got to say, uh, about this right here with Jaden? Start them. Two is back. Oh, I can go ahead and do it. Scott. Yeah. Two is back. You think he's going to be rested and ready to go? Or do you think he's going to have a little, a little gunshot because gunshot, because of the third concussed Arizona is a great game. If you've been struggling, um, at the QB position or just not getting back. Arizona is a great game to warm up. You know what I'm saying? Get your feet back in the water with. Oh, really quickly. Knowledge just wanted to know who Baltimore plays. I felt like we just touched on that earlier. Did we get it right? Yeah. Cleavelyn. Cleavelyn. Thank you, man. Good mind over there. Very sharp, dearest, make us look good. Yeah. But, uh, yeah, what do you call it? Miami has averaged fewer points per game than the last two winless teams in the Bryce Young led Panthers, but we'll get a huge boost with to his return. As you said, uh, you know, Waddle's average 47 and a half receiving yard zero touchdowns over 12 games without to to a, but he's average 75.2 receiving yards with all 19 of his touchdowns over 41 games with them. So he eats like Darius says he's going to eat with to us. So look for them to connect looks to be like somebody that he's very comfortable with and if you have him, it sounds like it's a must start. Yeah. Mike McDaniel calls again by different tools and a lot of them. So listen, uh, listen to this. So he said, I can go ahead and say what his team's name is. It's called Sikwan D's nuts. We're like kids. Are we really? We see something like this is fun. Right. It's fun boys. So he shows it shows me as team, dude. I, I need him to draft for me next year because I don't know what I was doing. Most people think that when I draft, it's an auto draft, right? Uh, but he got, uh, CJ Stroud, Barkley, Mason Hopkins. He's starting Hopkins. Yes, sir. He's a chief. What's that brother? He's a chief now. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Uh huh. I just like the playbook familiarity, but you got the goat passing to you. So that helps, right? Uh, Shakir Shakir. Am I saying that right? Buffalo Shakir. Uh, Shakir Shakir. Uh, yeah, that's his last night. Shakir, he's a sneaking one man. Uh huh. Cause you know, um, there's D and freaking Aubrey from Dallas. Dude, this guy's a freaking legend. Keith, you need to be on our fantasy every week, man, between you and Darius, Brandon and I can just coast on autopilot, dude, cruise control. This guy's got it going on, bro. So yeah, you know, Shakir has a lot of, uh, he Josh Allen in him, you know, he's the longest, he's the longest, longest tender receiver over there. Oh, really? Mm hmm. Okay. You know, since, since, um, since 14 is left, right, Allen has a good rapport with Shakir, very sneaky pick man. Yeah. Oh, now, now look at he showing me. Somebody else is showing me their team. It's just show one show off. Let's get into that after we go over the picks. Deanna wants to show me his now. Uh, so anyways, uh, let's get into this. Look at start rope. Ramon Dre Stevenson. That's our next, uh, Jetset, uh, Patriots. This is interesting. Let's break it down. We've already heard from Mr. Darius, lock the lock heart. Uh, exactly what to do here, but let's break this down. Let's play devil's advocate. Let's see what they say about this. Three hundred and seventy, uh, four yards, right? 62.3, uh, yards average, which is pretty, pretty good. Um, not really high, but decent, right? Four point yards per catch. Not, I'm not excited about that. Uh, and you got three touchdowns with a 33 yard long. So I mean, you know, it's a running back. You're, you, you cut loose on some of those. That's what I'm thinking. Uh, game plan, you're playing with the rookie quarterback, man. That makes a difference. Well, yeah, you got to do your check down and you, you know, like a receiver. As far as a running back, you ain't going to go deep, but what you do is you look for the yaks, the yards after catch, right? And it just don't feel like the gym with that just defense, that just defense feels like no rookie's going to come in there and throw the ball all over. It's been really let down of that. I've got them on my fantasy and they're just. They've had some tough matchups, man, going against them. Pretty good QBs last couple of weeks though. Yeah, I'm hoping I'm hoping I'm really hoping. Darius, I hope you're right, brother. Uh, the game script limited Stevenson's touchdowns last week. He should be healthier after returning to full practice just this Thursday. A few days ago, Stevenson hasn't even fumbled in back to back games. That's huge. Jets opponents have averaged the eighth most rushing attempts in the league. Wow. Stevenson has gotten 5.2 yards per carry and average 85 rushing yards and one touchdown over two games and Drake may gives the offense life. The jets have allowed the 12th most scheduled adjusted fantasy points to running backs. We were talking about tough teams and all that, but there's some tough running backs when excluding receiving. So Stevenson can be started if needed. The Patriots are a touchdown underdogs and have a low league total, but running back is thin this week. So I see, I see the other side about starting Stevenson. You know, I also see where you could start Hubbard also, you know? Yeah, I don't think it's a wrong answer, but you know, I just looked at the matchups and you know, a rookie court where a rookie quarterback going into, facing New York. It seems like they're going to stack the box up on them. Cause you know, the paper is not filled with weapons either. Wow. Keith just said that both jet safeties are out. That's huge. Oh, yeah. Make a big game. 315 yards, three touchdowns, one pick. Wow. Uh, let's move on. Let's move on to Darius neck of the woods at Lanagh Tampa Bay. They're saying to start Rashad. I think it's Rashad with two A's, uh, white. His numbers don't look great, but let's get into it. 227 yards, uh, 337.8 yards, uh, average, uh, yards per catch is 3.7. No touchdowns and 56 long. Uh, Bucky, Bucky Irving is dealing with a foot injury that could promise. This is better. That's a sweet while Chris Godwin and Mike Evans are out. White and Sean Tucker will see an expanded role in a matchup that should be fast paced Tampa, uh, games have averaged a whopping 55.6 points this season. And white should see even more targets than usual. He's the next option this week. Man, I'll tell you what, I wish I had Rashad this week. It sounds like he's going to be the bell cow, man. Yeah, he definitely is. But take also take a look at why receiver McMillan. And, uh, I think that's, it's that Sterling Shepherd. Yeah. Oklahoma receiver. Um, also the tight end number 88, uh, autonomous. I can't, you know, I'm bad with these guys names. Um, a top autotoman. Yeah. The Tampa Bay, Tampa Bay's tight end. Look at him as well. Yeah. I've been seeing his name and, uh, going back to what was the name you said a little bit ago, McMillan, you were talking about McMillan a little while ago, man, and you know what? I should listen to you because he was available and I didn't go. Maybe I think I did and I didn't pick him up, which doesn't make sense because if I'm in last place, I should be first in the way. Wait, what's going on, man? My math ain't math, Garius. Yeah. Um, yeah, McMillan, you know, he's, he's had chances to really slow, but he has a problem with drops, but this week, I don't think they have much of a choice. If he's open, they have to go to him because they're so there. They're two studs are out, man. Yeah. That this is a term. This is the time when the term next man up is very critical. And this next segment is brought to you by TC's world of wonders, your, uh, headquarters for all your dream Chicago sports jerseys and memorabilia. Darius and I have hit the table early and often with these guys. They got good quality products, 30, uh, day warranty. Uh, it includes shipping and taxes. So everything that you get and you get put in, uh, you tell Tom about our, you know, you're with CSP Chicago sports podcast and he gets you a discount right off the rip. Good quality dude, man. In states too, small town business, man. I back him a hundred percent. TC's world of wonders.com or a inbox me and I'll get you Tom's direct number, but, uh, good dude. So the next take on my list, I swear, Darius is reading neither my mind, which should be pretty easy and weird at the same time. Uh, or he's reading my show notes. It says Jalen McMillan is a sleeper, especially if he moves to the slot. So boom, there you go. You know, uh, let's move on to the Philadelphia Eagles at Cincinnati Bengals. What do you feel about this brand? And what do you feel about the Eagles and the Bengals? Right now to me, it looks like a shit show because the Eagles are pretty much a shell of themselves and the Bengals, they won like one game that not really still making me a believer. So I'm kind of like, I'm kind of worried they're saying start T Higgins, but I just heard T Higgins is out in the chat. So we're not, we're just going to move on past this one, but I would like to hear your take on this game. What do you say, Brandon? Man, like you said, man, both these teams, it's really hard. Who's going to come out with that win? Um, they're both struggling right now. Yeah. But, uh, T Higgins is out though. Why wouldn't I start him? Uh, well, yeah, exactly. So what, yeah, you'd have to basically look at somebody else in that situation with, with he's being out and I don't know who the next man up is. Do you know, Darius? Uh, camp in NASA's name, number 80. Um, start last night starts with a I he's going to be, um, he's a big, he's a bigger, um, um, style receiver, similar to Higgins, but I don't think he has Higgins as opposed to this. Um, no boys in boys in, uh, Tennessee. Yeah. I traded. And, um, no, it's number 80. Um, last night starts with a I, I can't pronounce it. Man, these guys in the chat, they will bail us out early and often, man, especially as far as I didn't know he was out. I know yesterday I seen that he was questionable, but if he's out, you know, they have office office for since then that is not an issue. They have Joe Burrow, you know, have they have little office line issues, but he's still delivering the football defense. You know, I think we can score against that defense, even though they have two good pass rushers, everything else is a lot. They leave a lot, you know what I'm saying? To be desired out there on defense. You know, everyone they played against kind of ran, ran up the numbers on them pretty much. Um, knowledge says a white dude rookie. I think yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's coming. It's coming. Hey, Darius Brandon, I think next show we need to start at 10 o'clock. That's my bet. I thought that we could get through intent from 10 30 to 11 30. I thought we could get through all this because with the bears, we can easily get through the bears, but that's one team that we're talking about. You got to get through the whole NFL and all these guys. You guys start a little earlier, especially if we want to get these guys a little bit of help before the 11 30 shotgun, you know what I'm saying? So that's my bad. We're learning as we go guys, but I appreciate all your help. Make sure you guys hit that like and subscribe button. Hit the notification bell, leave a good review. You all know what to do. Come check us out, man. And just a couple of days ago, we had a Hall of Famer golden jacket. Brian Ehrlacher was on the show, man. Freaking brick wall duty was on our show, man. It was freaking amazing. Go check that out. Look that hit that like button. Hit that not notification bell. I think that he will be on in the future. Hopefully near future. We're going to do some things with them. So I'm really excited about that. But yeah, let's get back into fantasy. I just wanted to give that shameless plug to our, to our crew and our team. Man, really quickly, J K Dobbins, man, I'm so disappointed. I feel bad for this guy. The injuries and stuff, especially Baltimore as a team, man. I remember we were three or four deep and I'm like, there's no way. And they seem to always find a guy just like the Niners. They always seem to find a running back or maybe it's our offensive line and their coaching. I don't know, but J K Dobbins is now in Los Angeles. And I was looking for him to show up and show out. I don't know what's going to happen, man. Right now he's only averaging three point yards per carry since getting over a nine point nine over the first two games of the season. Some concerns that he's returning from that Achilles surgery, but he should get a bunch of volume today because new New Orleans has allowed Kareem Hunt, Sean Tucker, Bucky Irving and Javante Williams, a total of 525 yards and six touchdowns over the last three weeks. And the Chargers are touchdown home favorites against a reeling Saints team like starting Spencer Rattler, which is a bad move, man. So game script should be favorable. What do you guys say about this, man? Start Dobbins? Um, I am. He's on my team. I'm starting. Yeah. He's on my team and I'm starting them. You know, he got, he had an injury in between those, uh, in between week three and week four, if I'm not mistaken. And, you know, Sandy, uh, Los Angeles is dealing with a challenge of philosophy. Boom. There it is. Thanks, Keith. Um, but again, but this week, you know, um, I think my man from Georgia, he was banged up too. I don't know if he's playing, uh, Makaaki. Yeah. Yeah. So Makaaki has emerged to be the number one receiver. And then also, you know, um, the tight end for LA, um, Disney, if I'm saying it correctly, uh, Disney, he should receive a whole lot of, um, um, reps as well as Makaaki, um, she'll open up and she'll open up things for, uh, J.K. Dobbins to do a thing. Like, you know, hardball believes in running the football. Yeah. I, he loves to run in the football. We've seen that, you know, over in Michigan, we've seen that time and time again. I mean, he loves running the football and setting up that quarterback. Very smart call. I agree with that. Thanks again, right there for that like we just saw go up, man. Got over a hundred in chat. So make sure we get those likes up. Brandon, uh, what do you say about this, man? It seems like a no brainer to start J.K. Dobbins, right, bro? That's what it sounds like to me. I'd start them. Yeah. For sure. For sure. For sure. Keith says, uh, Mckonkey is money in the slot. So there you go, bro. Hit that slot machine money maker. Let's move on really quick to Buffalo bills at Seattle Seahawks. Amari Cooper. Cooper was on the field for just 34% of Josh Allen's dropbacks during his first game in Buffalo, but he had a 42% TPRR and led the team in fantasy points. Seattle's top corners, Rick Woolen and Trey Brown are banged up and or out in Cooper's role is sure to grow in Sunday's fast paced matchup. Cooper can be a top 20 wide receiver moving forward after the huge upgrade at quarterback. What do you guys got to say about this? Yeah, look for a Mark Cooper to see a lot of the field today. You know, last week was, um, his first week in Buffalo, so they kind of, you know, just, you know, gradually brought him in, but he did score a touchdown for those owners of him. Um, so that was a good thing. Um, I expect to see a lot more production out here today as he gives more familiar with the offense and Josh Allen is going to be Josh Allen. Um, they have also learned to run the football a lot more. You know, we should open Amari up on the play action as well. No, yeah, I agree with you. Let's do it. And it makes sense to do that. I love Cooper man. I wish him well. I've always, you know, been a fan of his, uh, and, and I wish him the best. And I think, you know, he's in a good place right now. Once I saw that, uh, he, he moved in a Buffalo. I said, okay, good, you know, that's that he, he would do good with, at least I think he would do good with Allen. I don't know, you know, all the details, but just thinking, you know, forward thinking, um, here's an interesting thing. Uh, our next, uh, is brought to you by river street cavern. Uh, most, uh, delish Chicago's most delicious and fun sports diving, dining experience, uh, had to river street cavern and, uh, they got Chicago's biggest games, man, check them out. Um, and they are saying that we need to sit. Geno Smith will be missing DK Metcalf and gets a run funnel Buffalo defense outdoors. Wow. This is interesting. Let's, let's hear what they have to say about this. I'm not in a grudge at all with this. I do not, this is, I'm not backing this, this thought. Okay. Allen scored two touchdowns during his last game, but he's just the, uh, wide receiver and NX, uh, 49th wide receiver ranked in expected fantasy points. Allen could return from the buy healthier after playing through a heel injury, but it's possible. Roma Dunze sees a rookie post-pied bump as well. Um, so I'm thinking that I don't know why they would want to sit Geno Smith because he's, unless you have, unless you have someone, you know, a more high caliber quarterback. I don't, I wouldn't understand, you know, why you would do that. But hey, man, your team, I don't think that's why though. I mean, you have to look at both sides and that's what we try to do. I just don't, I can't agree with that side at all. And it doesn't sound like curious to us either, but like he said, it's your team. So, uh, I, I forgot to transition. I skipped ahead to that bears Washington game. They're saying sit Keenan Allen. I'm also not agreeing with this one. I think he's going to show out, but let's see what, what's, uh, what we got in the notes. Allen scored the two touchdowns. Uh, he could, you know, do better with his, you know, coming back from the heel injury. I understand why they sent that stick Keenan, but I don't agree with it. Right. Exactly. Caleb Williams is unquestionably shown growth and we could continue to improve, but his last three games against three easiest matchups in the league, he's gotten six, uh, yards per average and taken 11 sacks with the 2.4 touchdown to interception ratio on the road to open up his, uh, career. This matchup was moved to prime time, but the total sits just 43 points. Thanks to Marcus, Mario to likely starting for Jaden Daniels. Again, sounds like Jaden's starting. So look for those points to grow. I would bet the over if it's still at 43, um, because of that, because of that. Uh, I think it was set thinking that this tough kid is not going to play. If he plays, I think look to see more points out on the field, you know, um, Washington's defense is also dramatically improved, allowing the seventh few years, uh, EPA play over the last three games. The commanders have also yielded the fourth fewest fantasy points to the slot over the last month. So Allen deserves bench consideration because of being at the slot. But we also know that Kenan Allen is like a Swiss army knife, man. You could put him at X, Y, and Z. It don't matter. He's going to eat. Well, here's the thing. Washington plays a heavy man concept on defense. They're heavy man and they feel like, they feel like that Kenan is a lot more productive in the zone because he finds holes in the zone, sits there and you know, the ball is, you know, saying finds him. So that's why I think, you know, people are just are kind of heavy on sitting them, which is understandable. But, you know, if anybody, but it all depends on how your team is set up at the end of the day. If you can afford it, if you can afford to sit somebody like Kenan Allen, then you know, okay, but you know what I'm saying? I wouldn't sit them for anybody. Obviously you guys know that I need them on my team the way I spoke about my team. So I'm not going to tell you to set freaking Kenan. Okay. Jesus piece. Keith is saying, uh, yeah, but who is Washington played like the bears have played? Good point. I mean, they played Boston. I mean, they played Baltimore. They played, uh, they played, uh, Tampa and they played the Giants, but I mean, the Giants defense is not terrible. They just have some issues on offense like you wouldn't believe, but defense, but, um, you know, listen, Malik neighbors found a whole lot of success playing up against his commander saying, um, and we're down your Jones as a quarterback might I add so, you know, Raven Stevens is that bad mid 26 in the past? I didn't realize that. I thought they were still stalwarts or maybe is it just their run defense? Well, that like Raven is like I told guys before Ravens have the truck or have trouble with speed. You know what I mean? They have speed when they have speed. You know, they're going to get speed in their secondary to have trouble with it. And this Kingsbury offense, you know, you got a lot of little speedy guys around there. So gotcha. He says that we not keep week. We want is not a talk to keep. We can't say that because it didn't matter if they played Tampa in week 10, as long as they had, um, number 13 over there, as long as Tampa has number 13 there. And they had, you know, um, his number two there, they were going to get that against Washington regardless. Yeah. He says Tampa Tampa week one week one is a toss. I'm not sure if he meant toss or loss, but no, he's just feel like, you know, everything, everybody's even week one. And that's not, that's just not true. Right. So here's, here's something else we got to get into right now. Uh, let's get into, uh, Javante Williams, Carolina, uh, Panthers at Denver Broncos start Javante Williams. Interesting. That is one of the guys that I actually traded away him and T Higgins. I traded away for, um, uh, the running back for Gibbs. That was my trade T Higgins and Javante for Gibbs. And I thought that was a smart move because he's the cowbell, right? He gets a lot of runs and he gets a lot of receptions and he did a great job last year, but, uh, they're not passing to him as much. And it just looks like a whole different game plan. Uh, when, when Montgomery was banged up, I, he obviously cooked, right? But, uh, now that, you know, assuming that Montgomery is healthier, uh, maybe he takes some of that away, but getting back into Javante, he's averaging five point yards per carry and 16.8 points over, uh, opportunities the last four games. Um, Tyler, after Tyler bad, he was injured. He gets a prime matchup against the Panthers defense, allowing by, uh, far most, uh, fantasy points to run backs this season. Broncos are double digit home favorites against a Bryce young led Carolina team that's seated in the NFL high 13 rushing scores. Wow. Denver has highest implied total 26.5 points. Williams is a top 15 running back this week. Wow. That's, uh, had Williams this week. Yeah. Williams, Williams is coming along too. Um, I think he suffered an injury earlier, you know, earlier in the season. And then I think, uh, just to get, just to get the quarterback acclimated to the NFL, Sean Payton, Sean Payton, leading on a heavy pass. Offense for him. Yeah. The first couple of weeks he was throwing a ball that he was throwing. Oh, he had so many past attempts. It was crazy. Gotcha. Um, he has come along and again, what better way, what better game and what better team to see if you're struggling? Or if you want to, you know what I'm saying, boost your numbers. Then it seemed like Carolina. Yeah. Absolutely. I, I couldn't agree more. And, uh, now we're going to talk about, uh, sitting chub Hubbard, who's been terrific, but is terrible situation. Carolina will be starting young on an offense missing Deontay Johnson and Adam Theland against the Denver defense, allowing an NFL low 4.4 yards per play. The Panthers have an anemic 16.5 point implied team total and Hubbard has averaged 131 yards from scrimmage and 19.4 fantasy points, uh, in three full games without young in the season, he's averaged 59.3 and just 9.9 fantasy points during four games with him. I mean, I would say sit, uh, start chub because there's not a whole lot of weapons. Yeah. I understand the matchup like you talked about earlier, going against that stout defense where he may not be able to eat brother. You know, Chubb is a chubb is a stud man. And like I said, unless you have, you know, in the fantasy world, Chubb is considered a stud and then he said, unless you have someone that's, you know, equivalent to him, right? I'm not, I wouldn't sit him for anybody. I think they're expecting them to put eight in the box, crowd it so he can't go nowhere force young to throw to nobody because there's nobody to throw to, you know, but yeah, if I have to choose, you know, I lean it to, but Chubb, he's productive, don't get me wrong, but you know, he just, he's just up against so much and I say the same thing, you know, in the case of Remandia Stephenson, because remember earlier we talked about, you know, who the star, who to sit with that, but that's going up against a lot, man. Yeah. Yep. But I'm going to sit Nick Chubb for anybody. What's that? I wouldn't sit Nick Chubb for Chubba Hubbard. No, no, no, they weren't saying sit Nick Chubb for Chubb, they were talking about Chubb the whole time. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause they're going against Denver and the, the stout defense and Thelan's out and, you know, freaking up. Yeah. And Dehante Johnson's out who dropped the ball a lot when I dripped. I traded for him last year because I always do this. I always get a guy like Jamar Chase and Tim and Higgins. And then last year I got Dehante and Pickens. So I'm like, I got two receivers on same team and you got by weeks and someone's going to eat and sometimes somebody's not. It's, it's ridiculous. I don't know why I do it. I just like, Oh, two good receivers. Absolutely. You know, if you need somebody to lean on, if you just desperate Carolina has a rookie out of South Carolina, um, number 17 might have to pick him up or you lean on the Sanders, tight end Sanders from all of Texas. Okay. Number zero. Like that's if you're in like, you know, I'm saying no man's land and you just need somebody put there. Right. Yeah. You got to have a, some sort of backup and they're a lot. Yeah. Some of, some of us are in that situation, bro, because there's a lot of, there's a lot of injuries this year, man. Yeah. Already guys are getting banged up and stuff. I'm surprised. And you know, I thought that this whole thing about minus in a preseason game was going to keep guys healthy. I don't think, you know, football is football regardless. So, um, the next game says, uh, you know, Kansas city chiefs at the Raiders, uh, start patch, Mahomes. Now Mahomes has been a shell of himself. Yeah. Had receivers or anything like that. He's got more interceptions than he does touchdowns. And quite honestly, when you're looking at all this, it shows how really legit. Uh, their coach, Andy Reed is man. I mean, this guy can get it done even when, you know, it's backs up against the wall and they're plagued with injuries. I think if we had this many injuries with Chicago Bears, we'd be losing our freaking mind any team would really. I mean, you got the goat over there, Darius. Mahomes is likely to start performing up to his early ADP expectations moving forward, but he's a solid start this week. He's due for touchdown regression while ranking sixth in red zone passes, but just 22 touchdowns, especially with the addition of Deandre. Now Deandre can cook in the end zone. He is a red, uh, red zone target. And I look for him to get some jump balls and get some touchdowns up. So I am happy for Mahomes that he finally has somebody that can help him, uh, get that going because Xavier Worthy as a rookie, good player, but he's not no de hop man. Dehop is going to make that team look entirely different, man. And he's going to make worthy look better too. Cause he's worthy, worthy between Travis Kelsie and Hopkins. Defenses have to respect those names because of their resume. That means worthy could be wide open a whole lot. Yeah. Hey, Darius, let's take a trip, uh, down, met narrative street right now, memory lane. The Raiders beat Mahomes in Kansas city on Christmas day, right? The last time his teams met and they mocked him with the Kermit, the frog puppet in training camp. Remember that? Mahomes responded it and he says, uh, it will get handled. He's going to take care of business. It will get handled. You know, and his personal trainer tweeted, we will remember. So he, I think Mahomes is out for blood in a revenge on Sunday, bro. Hey, hey, it ain't going to be an easy killing. And it won't be an easy killing. A while than this, than Raiders today. He's going to wow. I like it. It won't be easy. You're killing the wild in the Raiders today. On, on your, uh, what do you call it? Uh, all of your great clips, man. That's the one that's going to be the one that stands out. Right. There'd be your Mount Rushmore clip right there. That's a good one. For sure, man. Uh, we're clipping that one. Um, yeah. Here's, here's something interesting. I want you guys to look at Alexander and Madison. Man, that guy looked so good. He looks so good in Minnesota. Right. He looks so different though. Like he, he looks a lot more explosive. Yeah. No. I, yeah. And you know when, uh, what, what he called, helped me out the running back that is absolutely, I don't see him anywhere. Why? Uh, for Minnesota Vikings, he's not there. Oh, uh, uh, the. You know, the one that's playing now. I know. Is he playing somewhere? Well, no, you know, they play, uh, Thursday. No, no, no, no, I'm talking about, he was there, uh, for, for a few years. I mean, he was there starting running back for a few years. For like quite a few years, man. I'm trying to. Oh, Dalvin Cook, he's with the Cowboys. Yeah. He plays today. So Dalvin got banged up a lot. Every time Dalvin got banged up, Madison came in and he went off. So I'm like, wow, you know, I was really looking forward to Alexander. You know, I thought that he potentially would stay with, you know, but they shipped both of them out. So whatever. But, uh, they're saying to sit Alexander Madison, who will be dealing with a negative, uh, game script against the chiefs, defense, allowing the fewest fantasy points, we're talking about fantasy points guys, uh, to running backs with a wide, uh, margin. No one has reached even 60 yards, uh, rushing yards against Kansas City chiefs this season. That's interesting to note because I did not know that. Did you know that? There is. Uh, I kind of had an idea, but I watched them against the Falcons. The Falcons had a lot of success with them, uh, doing a run, but they had a two-headed monster with, uh, with thunder and lightning down here. Um, like, you know, you're not going to, you're not going to have a lot of run success against the chiefs unless you're ahead in the game. Right. You know, I'm saying control the clock, but you know, they put so much pressure on another team's offense to catch up with them with the style of play that they play. Um, but I listened Brock Bowers, if any Raiders fans, I'm pretty sure, um, guys that picked them up, you know what I'm saying? It's on the, in the tight end space. I got one thing right this year. Yeah. Brock Bowers is definitely a guy to, um, to look into. Yeah. Did chiefs had a top two defense last three years. It's also worth noting that they are, uh, one of the top highest scoring defenses in the NFL. And that's why it's so important. Even when you have the goat on your team, defense wins championships. It makes it happen. This team, including the coach is being carried by the defense and the head coach while they're being decimated on the offensive side of the field ball. Excuse me. They called Karim Hunt. He was sitting on the freaking bench and said, Hey, bro, you still remember the playbook? Yeah. What are you doing? Sitting, chilling, watching Maury. Okay. Come on up, man. Come on up. We need you. Contract. He, he, you know, kicked the dust off and he, he did good his first week. It's what they can do, man. They're freaking Andy Reed is brilliant, man, but that defense, like, you know, she, uh, he said cheeses had top two defense in the last three years. And Chris is a monster. So we got two more games we want to talk about. I'm sure dares is going to have some good nuggets of the day with these two, uh, in Dallas Cowboys at San Francisco 49ers and the Giants at Pittsburgh Steelers. We'll start off with the Dallas Cowboys at San Francisco 49ers. They're saying to sit deck Prescott. Uh, it depends on who you have on the bench. I, I, you know, that that hasn't been great this season, but from fantasy standpoint, he's going to throw the ball and he's going to throw it a lot. Now, Daven Cook is going to make his debut today against the 49ers. Um, so that could help him out or it could be a lot of the same. You know, you got these older running backs, man, who's been, who's been very inconsistent over years, but either catching on to a team or just getting reps. Period with him and Zeke Elliott. And then you have Dotto, you know, that's there, you know, CD lambs going to get the ball, man. Let's just listen for the weakest part of the 49ers is that secondary. Everyone knows that. Um, unless they're going to, you know, double and triple team CD Lambo, even then that's going to force that ball down the field. Yeah. I mean, I, I agree too. I don't see why. I mean, you know, if for whatever reason, I would think that Dak would be somebody's go to when in terms of being a starting quarterback on their team. But if you have somebody else, that's a better option than Dak, which would be weird why unless it's a two quarterback, uh, fantasy league, I would still start Dak, but there's some noticeable points and we'll go over those in the moment. We'll jump right into the New York giants, Pittsburgh Steelers, where they're saying to sit, uh, or I'm sorry, start Najee hairs. Uh, Dallas often showed big improvement after the last buy, uh, last season. And the Cowboys, uh, hope the same happens this year. They ranked 20th in scoring after leading the league in 2023, but press guard has finished as a top 10 QB just once over six games this season. And San Francisco opponents have the fourth lowest passer rating of 78.7. The Cowboys have the eighth lowest implied team total of 20.5 points during a week with many QB alternatives. I mean, there's, there's, there's the other side to it. I could see that. So, well, I mean, we got to look at 49 or two on the office, man, you know, brought parties out, uh, without IU who blew his ACL. It's the ACL or Achilles wanted to, but he's out for the year. You know, he's going to have to lean on guys like Jenin and Pyrrhusaw and it's, it's kiddo plan this week. Kettle. Yeah. He's, he's been on the injury list almost every game. I don't know if I don't have them. Debo's, Debo's has been struggling, Debo has been struggling with, uh, he had a pneumonia situation, correct? Yeah. He's in the hospital. So, uh, they're going to be run heavy, I guess. And Dallas is terrible against the run, boy. I'll tell you. Right. Man, I'll tell you what, let's, let's get into the giants at Pittsburgh. Now, let me tell you this one thing, boys. I am, uh, or boy, cause Brandon has it came back yet. Don't worry. I'm not seeing, seeing double feeling single yet. I haven't hit bridge or scoreboard, but, uh, anyways, uh, yeah. The giants, the giants as a whole has really impressed me, especially with their quarterback, just being a flat out bum, why they kept him when they had options to go ahead and grab somebody else in this draft is just beyond me. Other than, is there something to the, the fact of maybe it have a little bit of pride at stake or something and, and keeping him and saying, Oh, I can make this work. That's why you think it was there. Well, I think they paid them. You know, the fact that they paid them and they, they paid them a lot. Yeah. You know, and I guess they felt like they had a lot more pressing needs at other positions and you know, they felt, if they felt like, just like a lot of the bears, man's felt with Justin, they felt like if they can put a lot more around him, he'll be better. But you know, let's not mistake, man. Listen, Daniel Jones has a playoff victory. He's meant to the playoffs. He has a playoff victory. So, you know, it's not, you know, the only things, only things missing from him is consistency and being healthy. And I think a lot of his inconsistency has come from him being hurt. I don't, I don't like him, but maybe that's what I'm not in love with. I mean, trust me. But you know, if you're in a situation like the giants, you have to, you paid them so much money, you have to kind of lean on them for a while. Sometimes. That's right. Kind of lean, evens out. Sometimes we forget that the money does have to do with it. But I've seen where some big money gets cut and they absorb it and that there's some big, big baller moves out there where this, you know what, pack your bags. We don't want you no more. And that money, they're done. Usually when it happens that way, they have someone else in mind. Yeah. They don't, they don't have anybody else over there. I like what he says, man. It makes perfect sense. And this is a big problem, a systemic problem. I think this is the start of really looking at everything as a whole with the New York giants. Just call it what it is. They made the wrong move by signing Daniels and not paying Barclay. I mean, that's in hindsight, man. I get rid of Barclay. He's so good, man. He's so good. Yeah, but they've had them, they've had them for so long and they just haven't been like he just hasn't made them what they want them to be. You know what I mean? You know, at the time when, you know, at the time when they decided to sign Daniel Jones, he had just came off a playoff victory. You know, so they felt like he was on the incline up the up climb. You know what I mean? Right. So he had, he had a decent year. He had 3000 yard year. You know, he was very, his image interceptions were very low. And you know, he looked man. I want to touch on what J2K just said, because it's right before the game. We still got a few hours, but it's important because this is a Chicago Bears show and this is really good to know. Washington rookie left tackle. Brandon Coleman is out today. He was the starter. So that's, that's really important to know, especially for our defense and protection as far as Jaden, does that move? Does that move the needle at all? Whether Jared Jaden starts or Mariota, what would you say about that blindside? Would that move for you at all? Darius, if you're the, you're the coach? Uh, if I'm thinking about the future, then, you know, I would see it. Jaden, but you know, just, I always like, if you want to win, you want to have your best players on the field right now. Washington is the first place in the division. And they want to do whatever it takes to keep that going. You know, so in order to do that, you have to have your best players on the field. If he's ready to play, let them roll. Now with the, with the left tackle being out, listen, Dan is very lucid. He's going to find a way to get around the pocket, you know, get outside the pocket and get loose and he's not going to sit back there and hold it for a long time. If you watch him, he's going to sit back there for a minute. If that first read is not there, more than likely you're going to try to get up out of there. Breaking J2K just said, Quinn just said Daniels is playing. So we don't have to worry about the table tennis, you know, face Daniels just said that right now. Chase, the bear's job is not to necessarily over commit to sacking him, but you, like I just watching what I've seen, I think it's the best thing you can do is try to keep him in the pocket and force you to beat him from there because he will kill you if he gets up out of there. Okay. Hey, yeah. And you know what? He kills you with rushing get yards too, because that's what I'm saying. Yeah. If he gets up out of that pocket and, you know, starts making plays with his feet. Yeah. It's, it's very, listen, it's very, you know what I'm saying? It's a huge let down to a defense. When it reacts and whether he's going to slide, if he's going to run out of bounds or what he's going to do with these ribs, I mean, you're really going to protect him and be gun shy about getting any sort of hits. You're definitely going to want to run, but what do you do? It's going to be interesting to see how he plays with this. I'll be looking into that. That's important to me to oversee what he does. Like I said, I feel he's going to be around the league for a while. So, uh, yeah, let's check it out. I mean, unless he absorbs a lot of injuries and the rib is first to many, I hope it doesn't happen, but something to take a pain and look at for sure, man. Yeah. He's not trying to anything like this, man. He dealt with this and LSU as well. Oh, yeah. Well, he's had a rib injury before. Yeah. Yeah. He got hurt. Uh, boy, I want to say against, I want to say it was against Alabama. It's one against, it was, it was later in the year they planned a conference schedule and he got hurt, but he stayed in the game. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Staying the game and, you know, listen, SEC is where the physical defenses are and, you know, he made it through it. He's going to have injuries like this because he runs. He runs with determination, but he's not very, he's not very big guy. He's a tall guy, but it's very, very light. Light, like you're very, very small frame. I think he needs to bulk up, put some, some weight on, you know, for sure. Um, getting back to the Giants, Pittsburgh Steelers, start Najee Harris. George Pickens gets a huge fantasy boost with Russell Wilson starting. Gee, Harris does too. He's sharing snaps with Jalen Warren, but percentage of runs against the light box is nearly double compared to his time with Justin Fields. The Giants have allowed the ninth most, uh, scheduled adjusted fantasy points to running backs and the Steelers are six point home favorites. Monday night, they're saying starting Najee Harris makes it. Uh, I just added one to my team last night, if I'm not mistaken, because I feel like he's going to be, you know, saying he's going to be, um, pretty, um, good after backfield, you know, catch a passes on, check now such things of that nature. But yeah, Pickens, she ever see the boost because the secondary for the Giants, you know, those corners in, in, in particular, uh, now the Giants, as far as the pass rush, you know, they get, they can get there. You know, they got some guys up front also with the linebackers. They're pretty good, but you know, I think what hurt was hurting the Giants more than anything is that, um, offensively, man. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So it's 12 o'clock. The, the noon games are starting. We want to cut you guys loose. You guys can get into Sunday. We've all been waiting this whole week, not just for the Bears, but just the NFL and the five months of football goes fast. So yeah. Um, he says he sees a upset Giants may win. Uh, getting back to the, uh, the Bears game. He said he could see Daniel staying in the pocket more. It should free up a spy linebacker for us. That's good news. So I like that. Yeah. Stay in the pocket more and not running out because you got to protect them ribs. AC Adam says, gotta hit them ribs when they get to him. I mean, that's football, man. That's the name of his strategy. You got to go for, for what's easy. So, and that's easy right there. Remember guys, the zebra doesn't change the stripes. You know what I'm saying? When you out there on that football field, you go to instincts. Yeah, for sure. What's going on. So, you know, hey, the only thing we can do if you decide to creep out there is make them pay as much as possible. Yeah. Yeah. I think we're all in agreement with that. If it's a resounding, let's get after him type approach with our fans, at least. Key says neighbors is back Lawrence in burns and Thabadou will get to Wilson. Thabadou. Listen, you know, getting to Wilson is one thing, but trusting Daniel Jones versus that's still a defense man. Try, I'm trying to go to trying to stay on, on topic with the Bears and then they get in the chat and switch back over to what we were talking earlier. Yeah. Makes everybody gets hurt. It's kind of like a weird, what we're figuring this fantasy out there. Keep, keep, keep it still unlucky. You know, hey man, for the people out there, if you got a couple of dollars to blow, you know what I'm saying? Hey, if you're unlucky, go for it. Yeah. Absolutely. Make sure you hit that underdog fantasy and put in the promo code CSP boys. I kind of want to lean with AC here, man, but man, Jacksonville has been so bad against the past. Yeah. They don't go bad. Where did I put my picks at? Was that the, was that the main thread? I think, no, I think I put them in both. You put them in both. Yeah. I want to go over those really quickly guys. That it, like I said, the promo code for underdog fantasy. I should have uploaded this picture and put it on here. So for everybody to look at matter of fact, let me do that right now. Darius, just permission, just go ahead and keep these guys entertained while I do that really quickly so we can go over this fantasy stuff right here. I actually, I put in two, two, I got two wagers. Yes, we'll go over that. Yeah. I mean, AC, as a Bears fan, I do want Green Bay to lose this game. And I think Jacksonville offensively can, you know, submit a challenge, but oh, defensively man, Jacksonville is just, it's an undisciplined route. And they just, they're bad, man. They're bad. Say, Brandon, you, you posted your picks from yesterday. The one you sent yesterday. I'm going to do it right now. So yeah, just keep them entertained for a minute. And I'm all give me like two more minutes. Gotcha. Um, as far as our bears, people's caught and people call me crazy, but I really feel like if we keep names in their pocket and force them to throw that ball deep, we'll have a lot of success. Let me see who was in the chat. Yeah. Keep neighbors is back. Yeah. Lawrence and Burns and Tivito. They may get the Wilson. I just don't trust Daniel Jones. Keith, you got me thinking though, I don't trust Daniel Jones. I can't. Shout out to everybody that's participated today. Hope you guys enjoy this first lady games. It's, um, it's 12 and one o'clock slate. And get ready to be ready for some football. Three your time for your time for my time. Three o'clock your time for my time. Commanders versus bears. Okay, here we go guys. Here's our first pick that we've got on here. Underdog high and low. That's basically what it is. It's pretty simplistic. You just pick who's going to go high. Who's going to go low. I picked CJ Stroud to get over 1.5 touchdowns. So if it gets two touchdowns passing, then you get that pick right. And each pick that you get, it multiplies. You can go up to 45.64 times with some of these and even higher. Sikwan Barkley, I got over 79 and a half rushing yards. And if I get that right, I went high on that, not low. Actually, I went a high on all these. But Bajon Robinson, 65 and a half yards. I feel a little bit more comfortable about that than Sikwan. But I think that's a good thing. I feel a little bit more comfortable about that than Sikwan. But Cincinnati's been kind of stinking up the joint. So that's why I went ahead and went with that. CD Lamb, I went 77 and a half. Jalen Hertz, and that's in receiving yards obviously. Because you can get both. You can do a wager, Darius knows this. You can do a wager where you get receiving and rushing yards. And that would be a higher number in the 90s or something like that. Whatever, versus 77 and a half. Jalen Hertz, 221.5 yards passing. That's very, I mean, that's very easy to do. That's kind of pedestrian type numbers, as far as a quarterback. So I felt comfortable going that way. Same with Joe Buro, 239 and a half. I felt very comfortable with that. Hence Joe Buro, when he's hot, he can sling it, and go well over 300. but 20, 239.5 is logical. Again, this is just some sort of a strategy. I don't have any insider. It's just me just trying to go with it, you know, and having a little bit of fun. I put 10 on it. Mar-Chase, 69 and a half, again, pedestrian for him. If he can do that, great. I've seen him go really much higher than that. So I felt comfortable with that. Field goal kickers, you know, this one kind of got me, but I went ahead because field goal kickers have been doing a lot this year and 2.5. I love field goal kickers. Yeah. Aren't you the one that was telling me, was that you? Was that you? Yeah, man, listen, man. Making us money. Kickers get you paid, man. So if you put in the promo code CSP again, that Chicago Sports Podcast, they will match your first thousand dollars and then the second they'll match half of that. So yeah, check it out. CSP Underdog Fantasy is the largest in the world, the largest fantasy app. You can do all the sports, NBA. They've got a lot of stuff going on with NBA right now. Ooh, Jamar Gibbs is already in the red zone. All right, so check this out. Here's my next one. Again, I put 10 on that. This one is different. I got Jordan Love, 249.5 yards. I felt comfortable with that, most notably because Sean said so and Sean's doing pretty good this year. Javante Williams, 59 and a half. Very high, J2K. What's that? No, it was J2K, so he's gonna check out the games. Oh, okay, cool. Hey, thanks, J2K. Javante Williams says 59 and a half yards rushing. I like that one. CJ Stroud, 229 and a half. Yards passing, I like that one. Kenneth Walker, the third, 91 and a half yards. I think he's gonna get a good bulk because there's so much right there with Seattle and he needs to, you know, he's gonna be the bell cow right there. Jordan Mason, 78 and a half. I like that one for San Francisco. That's another Sean pick. James Cook, I got a discount right there with James Cook. You see that slash there? It was at 1.59 and a half. My discount dropped them all the way down to 41 and a half. I used my discount on James Cook versus Seattle. Nujoku, 58 and a half yards receiving. I like that one. And Jaden Reed at 66 and a half. I got that one for rushing and receiving yards total. So that's what I got going on over there, guys. Those were my picks brought to you by Underdog Fantasy. So check them out, please, guys. And guys, for the guys and girls that's doing parlays with our sponsor Underdog, which is the best in the world, make sure you guys pay attention to the matchups. Matchups matters because matchups depict the style of play that these teams are gonna play. We can't always look at the stats from weeks prior, you know, because matchups matter. You never know, guys jump out there to a blowout. And then you're not gonna get to produce you need from a quarterback, you know, because they're gonna run the ball a lot more. You know what I mean? Now, if you got a good game, it's a chance that the quarterback's gonna throw the ball a lot more, you know, and it's gonna be a lot more action to the receivers. You know, you gotta pay attention to who that team is playing on a week to week basis. Yes. All right, guys, that's it, man. Hey, Darius, thanks for carrying the show.

They're giving away a 55 inch television. Lots of goodies. We're gonna have five trivia questions where you're gonna get some pretty cool merch and come hang out and check out with us, man. I look forward to seeing you guys and next week, most notably, we will be up there at two o'clock with quarterback Jim Miller and big cat Williams, man, is coming into town. Both of them boys are coming into town and they're gonna hang out and check out the Cardinals screen with this another away game. That's gonna be a good time. Same bad time, same bad channel. We're gonna be up there. We're gonna do a pregame. Jim Miller is gonna be talking to X's and O's, the ones and the twos with everybody. He's gonna be pointing at the TV screen, screaming at our guys to do this and do that. It was a good time.

Super good time, great dudes. And you'll be able to hang out with your boy. The other guy, I just call myself the other guy, Darius, when I'm hanging out with him. That's what I mean. You got your, let me hold you back. Well, what do you got? You want a drink? I'll get a full refill of that. You want some food? What are we doing, you know? But yeah, man. So thanks again, Darius. Thanks, I appreciate you, man. No problem. Thanks for having me and I appreciate the chat. The back and forth with the chat is always fun. You know, it's always good to hear how other people think when it comes down to this wonderful game. And so I wanted to say, man. Yeah, I just saw Kyle Pitts got a 36 yard TD catch. And let me see what else. Two yard receiving TD caught by Jamar Chase. That's my guy. So things are going good. I didn't see anything happen with Jamar Gibbs in the red zone. So maybe he's fizzled. Hopefully he got some yards for me. I hope you guys do good. I hope you win unless you're against Darius or I. I really hope I'm against you. I hope you forgot to start somebody because I need a win in the last play. I'm the underdog. You want to know why I like underdog fantasy because I always root for the underdog because I'm the underdog. I mean, good luck this week, man. Thanks. Thanks, you too, buddy. All right. Should I town out? Bear down. See you guys.
