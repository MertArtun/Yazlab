 All right, well school was good peasants. We're here. I know every all you guys were ancients for this live stream CEO, you know just curse out the peasants for both. I mean listen those Like the vast majority's peasants in the comment section really can't say anything the only one that can say something It's probably Jordan and the random editor apart from them Who else in the comment section has the audacity to say anything with their garbage teams? Oh Some cheese to beat the raiders, right? Yeah, I mean obviously Well, I last time I checked was like 27 to 20. I was watching the Bears in a redskins game So is what is we're definitely gonna talk about that, but let's get right into it CEO Starting off a Thursday night football We all love Thursday night football of the Rams beat the Vikings out 30 to 20 Killing any Matthew Stafford Cooper Cup trades. I'll see all your thoughts Listen the Rams are now, you know back informed because they got their receivers back and like I said like we said We said this before and we'll say it again this whole Vikings Like sure like this holds parade people throwing a parade how beautiful how great Sam Darnold is and and all that bullshit To back-to-back losses. All right back to back losses each shit. They're not that good All right, and by the way, they are good just they have no quarterback Yeah, that really sums it up It is what is this Thursday football gives a shit Packers beat Jacksonville 30 to 27. Unfortunately my boy Jordan Love got injured with a groin injury Yeah Packers good team without Jordan Love stole a good team, but Honestly, bro, they can still win with Willis. I'm just keeping honest with you. I don't know Lions next week No, no, not against the lines again fuck if they don't have love but this is in my opinion It's the second best team behind the lines. I'm very strong lines believer as you know I like that. I like the path. By the way, just because I'm a Lions believer doesn't mean I don't think the Packers are good I think they're great. I just think they're a little bit young on season and this Jordan Love How long does it groin last does anyone know? I have no idea. I don't know bro. I mean I Can't we can't really calm injury prone. It's his first year but It's just I don't like the fact that Like not because he's not bad. It's that he's not good It's just that I don't like like he's getting it like every time he gets into a rhythm He gets injured and that kind of that that'll fuck up your Yeah, fuck up the exactly so listen Packers are a good team well coach. It's awesome coach wish I had a coach like that Awesome coach Jaguars bro fucking trash bro. But by the way, Brian, I will say this Brian. I love Brian Thomas Jr. is great No, he's not no, he's not better than Malik, but he he's uh, he's I mean, I guess you could say he's playing better than Marvin But he's top three. He's top three for sure. He's top three I'll say he's playing better than Roman doomsday. I'll say that I was definitely I don't know what the hell's going on there I don't think any of us were really high on room Yeah, so Falcons beat the Bucks 31 26. I'm honestly shocked by this. I'm shocked You know shout the Baker for cooking you feel me Without Mike Evans or Chris. He's still cooked up. I'll see all your thoughts Here's the thing with Baker bro And we played and we didn't really talk about the Bucks and Ravens because it was Monday night games so kind of like It kind of but here's the thing. This is what I could say about Baker too many interceptions Turns to that he's good. He's good. He kind of he's kind of like Like breath forward, but on crack Like too much too much too many turnovers like that's my only thing like When he though the reason that the Bucks lost because he threw like what three picks Yeah, I'm like I'm no he threw two picks here when we played against the Ravens when he played against the Ravens It was three. It was like three picks like you can't play like that. I mean I understand, you know It's just I feel like the play calling is is too aggras it's too aggressive urgent a little bit too aggressive In terms of the Falcons row her cousins, you know doing what her cousins does just you know Good excellent regular season, but no one goes a flying fuck about regular season When it comes to Kirk Kirk cousins Falcons are a decent team ever since a Godwin by the way The bowls are stupid for leaving Godwin out there And your players you already lost the fucking game, bro Like I hated that shit because our players are about to injure to does that motherfucker didn't stop playing anyway Listen without Mike Evans and Godwin They're not doing anything even though Baker's not bad. They're not doing anything with who's our top receiver now I mean without them it's like it's like you take away T Higgins and Jamar Chaser the what is broke all? We're gonna get to that. Yeah, we're gonna get that but imagine if he didn't have those people You can't ask Baker to the throat of fucking Trey Tucker or some shit like that. Oh fuck that is Josh Palmer some shit. Like I know You know shout out to Baker, but the oh they got so much ever I forgot about that watch those don't shepherd But you can agree though. They're seasons old effect. Yeah. Yeah, I think Evans out for a lot of weeks So yeah, they're seasons about done. Oh Let's get to it CEO your Baltimore Ravens Falls short to famous James Winston 29 to 24 in a very exciting game See all your thoughts My thoughts are the same thing I've been complaining about the past weeks This defense is disgusting This is this is one of the worst defenses I have witnessed in my In my what 20 years of being a fan That's a lot. I Mean guys you have to understand something this is Baltimore. All right We don't have bad defense in Baltimore. They really doesn't exist I mean the fact that I'm witnessing like hot garbage for the first time in my life is something I have never ever witnessed so listen was this game wasn't good for either side of the ball Rashad bait me. I don't know if you saw that drop, but oh my god. Oh my god, bro. You could have made that catch like I Don't even know what to say about that This was on the Mars fault if for those who you who haven't watched the game You're probably gonna think it's the Mars fault, but it isn't The listen I will say this James Winston sucks Dude sucks nuts and I the only reason I'm saying is that is because our receivers dropped four picks bro four picks Drop he threw he threw it right to them when he when he faces a What you said why were you mean DB's? Yeah, yeah, yeah when he threw it to our DB's right like you saw I'm you don't watch the game right? No, I couldn't I only watched the last quarter. All right. Okay. You watch the last quarter, right? Did you see Kyle Hamilton drop that pig bro? Oh, yeah? If he caught that pig what would happen? Oh, that's game over so Yeah, bro, yeah, bro We're gonna get to that we're gonna get to a we're gonna take our victory laps very soon on that shit, but listen Ravens they're a good team, but they're an incomplete team The offense is really good and the defense is really bad. I don't think I've ever seen this in Baltimore. Usually it's Really good defense and fucking horrible offense Unfortunately Zach or is a disgrace Zach or is one of the worst coordinators I think I've ever seen in my life and You know, that's all that's on that's on John Harbaugh for hiring him Yeah Whatever listen Browns are not going anywhere the Ravens are gonna win their games for all you Ravens haters Don't think this means anything. We're gonna get to the playoffs and we're only gonna get bounced by Kansas City and that's about it until Harbaugh gets fucking fired I Do I will say this, you know you I will say this for all the Ravens fans So I don't know if you saw my comments section CEO. No me comparing Lamar Jackson The pay manning was a very insult to a lot of Lamar Jackson fans in my comment section That was a comp. So I have a very nice video coming out about the Huh? Oh, that was a compliment, bro You're gonna see in my video tomorrow I don't know if it's they were Lamar fans who uh, who said They were so pissed off that was comparing him to a pay manning, I don't know. I don't know why I mean if we're listen as Right now as a right now First of all, it's not like paint a lot of people can consider pay manning like a top three quarterback of all time I don't get it. I don't get why you get me Whatever bro, hey fanboys this stupid so it is what it is And I also said to my friend like don't be shocked if the Ravens on the road This is the second program lose to the Cleveland Browns, especially with Watson not out there. So I mean Is what it is Lines blow out the tie into Who's shocked? I mean the lines It's not it's not listen. It's only impressive because they scored 50. That's about it The point no one cares about the Titans. They're fucking garbage But I will say this the lines offensive play calling in terms of having fuck I mean the kind of Offensive trickery that they do like you have linemen throwing touchdowns Like it's it's so weird. I mean it's so innovative I'm not sure if it's gonna come to bite them in the future, but it is a very interesting offense lines are my number one team in the in the NFC, you know that so Shout out to the Wines room Not saying much Now I want to talk about the Texans and Colt CEO I Colt Texans won have a winning record, but can I get my credit? I said this team will take a step back and we can see CEO this is not the same team from last year CJ Stroud is not playing at an MVP level and Ever since Nikols went down CJ's kind of admit, but let's be for yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a fact It's a fact So like I mean Texans are a good team, but I don't see them doing anything in the playoffs I want to see no, they're probably gonna get bounced by Baltimore. I'm gonna be honest. Yeah, and listen I'm gonna say this Apart from you know Stroud looking mid cuz he ever since Nico went down. He is looking better That's not a good sign by the way. And by the way, he has digs and ting Dell out there But don't show up there too as well. No, no, yeah, I agree with you But he does it's not like he has lack of weapons, right? I mean he has weapons up and and we seen quarterbacks before because CJ's always up there and like the top five for a lot of people so You seen Lamar you seen Alan you see people work without without people like Like digs my home Last use yeah, my home. Yeah, my homes has well, I can't really say Josh's yet How we still put up numbers today without Evans and Chris so Yeah, so listen, I'm not we're not saying he's bad like trash. I don't want people to think that but I just think this is why we say You know pump the brakes a little bit When it came to his rookie year we said that you know as far as The Colts brought Anthony Richardson looks like fucking trash. Yeah, I mean I Mean this dude is I mean bad like super bad like it's not even it's not even you know I'm cold bro. Why the fuck did you take him? He could have been something good if he wouldn't went to a team and sat but instead the Colts had a fucking take him And anything the Colts take that the fucking room. I'll I pay an angel luck So Is what is there? Oh? Oh, yes, CEO Philadelphia 37 bingles 17. Oh, man This is a good Sunday. Yeah, very good fucking Sunday And I have and I have a video about the bingles I'm gonna let CEO take a you know CEO needs to be in cheerful spirits So I'm gonna let him take a dump all over the bingles. I'll say this feeling impressive win And I think me and CEO both picked the bingles, but going second role game That's another blowout impressive win, but CEO can this finally confirm Joe borough is not a top five quarterback He's not you you got to take him out. See you you have to okay Let's see against and your March ace So I was rooting for the Eagles obviously because they're playing a division rival Yeah, but I what I want to say this it's a lot of people right? The sense and we've been on this sergeants in the beginning the Cincinnati bingles are not a good team No, okay, they're in the same breath as As as other bad teams, they're not as bad as let's say the fucking Jets or something like that, but they're oh But there are they are a bad team. They're not a good team So this is why I don't want people to think oh my god Joe bro Joe borough slurping and we've said it or yeah I had them finishing right In the beginning in our predictions, right? Yeah, I had them finishing third and out of the playoffs and you had them finishing fourth Yeah, and out of the playoffs So that was our prediction so it's not like this comes as a surprise to us a lot of people Love the the Joe borough slurping Joe borough and I'll say it again. He's he's he's Alex Smith with good weapons That's exactly who he is like Joe borough And I know like all the people that love Joe borough and this and that and still put them above People like Lamar or Allen. I mean you're stupid if you still think that bro I'm not saying I still think bro is a top-ten quarterback. Don't get me wrong sure but like he's not This show shiesty Joe cool This small this guy who's gonna win multiple Super Bowls No, first of all, he's in a shit organization Cincinnati Bengals a poverty franchise who's horribly run and not to mention Joe borough to begin with wasn't that great. I mean he had a you know, he he's like an elite He's like an elite midperson late He tops out at the mid bar, right? So he's not like He's like borderline good if that makes sense, right? Yeah, I agree Like that's where he is like you can win with him, but you're not going to he's not in it He's not a generational town. Okay, that's what I want to say. He's not a generational town. He's just a pocket passer He can barely move Okay, he's just a pocket passer who has adequate mobility and Because he has your marches because he has tea Higgins He can throw it up in the air and they're gonna come down on there and when they're one-on-one matchups That's usually what's going on with with people like like that. So listen Bengals I'm happy that you're miserable. I'm happy that your seasons effectively. Oh, well, it's not really over not so sensibly speaking but I Would love it to be over if we want if we want it would have been over but Listen bangles, you know All the Cincinnati fans that come in the comment section talking shit Go fuck yourself. I got some free out Wednesday. Yeah, you go fuck By the way, Bengals fans enjoy this because T Higgins is out So this is what Joe Burrow and what your team is gonna look like when you just have to marches Yeah, you're done. I mean they're done, bro. They're done Done done done done and not top five Done Eagles you're not off the fucking hook All right Listen, I don't think you're hot shit by the way or you're back or you don't think don't think for one second because you beat the fucking bangles That I'm thinking that out all of a sudden. I think you're hot shit. No You're you're gonna go you're probably gonna win the division You're probably gonna go you're gonna go to the what's it called playoffs and Then you're gonna get mounts You're not Super Bowl contenders You're not Super Bowl contenders period and I'm sticking by that shit I don't like your coaching and I'm I will I will say it to the top of my lungs Your coaching is trash. I don't care about all you eagle fans out here trying to hype up shit This is what eagle fans do bro. If you if you lost this game, you would have been ready to end it all Okay, I know your fan base very fucking well. Okay, so when it comes to the Eagles You're gonna make the playoffs, but you're not contenders. You're not going to Super Bowl get that shit out of your mind Okay, you're not it's over. You're not making the Super Bowl this year I don't think anyone apart like taking out Eagles fans, right? seriously thinks that these Nick Sirianni lead team is really gonna do shit in the fucking playoffs and get deep in I don't think so. I don't see it Filly, I mean No, silly. I'm gonna leave you out alone shout to y'all for being the Bengals I think I hate the Bengals more. I hate Philly to be honest with you. We don't hate Philly. It's just I'm being honest I don't I Don't have anything with Philly because we're not even the same conference. You used to be a Giants fan We're not even in the same conference Right. Yeah, but my thing is I'm not delusional in terms of I try to put my fandom aside when it comes to analyzing Sports right? Yeah, because if I didn't put my fandom aside, I would be saying the Ravens Oh, it was just a little mistake and then we go beat the Bengals and X I mean I think was the Broncos the next week and I'll be saying yeah We're Super Bowl favorite by the way, RJ during this whole because the past three weeks They've been really dick riding Dick Henry and Elamart, right? Yeah In my in my discord profile. What is my profile? Hashtag fire Harbore and or so did that change during the duration of the win for the five game win streak? Absolutely not me there for me. No, I am very consistent when I see bullshit when I see fuckery at the coaching position And I see fuckery at the Eagles coaching position Do I think that hurts is a is a bum? No, I don't think he's a bum, but I want to see him without serrani I think serrani is still a bum. I'm a diamond. Yeah, I will agree with that because I mean At least what her I mean see there's not denying. I mean they the players came out and said it The serrani came out and said it Jalen Hurts is the leader in that locker room like So clearly the players like him serrani needs to go. I saw was that whole coach that they need to go Uh, it is what is there? It's speaking of go, uh jets I don't know what the fuck's going on here bro Y'all lost to the fucking drake may and jacobi brisette Yeah, blow it up blow it the fuck up Devon's bro, I'm sorry. Why the fuck would you go to the jets? Yeah, I've been said he's dumb. You should have went to Bro, he could have listened. I don't know listen. I don't know the contract situations But I'm pretty sure didn't he say specifically that he wouldn't he didn't want to go anywhere else but the jets He said the jets in the saints Okay, he's just retarded them Like he like because one had derrick card the other one had erin so Okay, so he doesn't okay. First of all, he doesn't want to win. That's plainly obvious. He just wants to hang out with his buddies Yeah, um Listen, if I'm a jets fan, which thank god i'm not if I was a jets fan I'm like, you know what? Fuck you erin rogers. I want to blow the shit up Uh, this is unacceptable. By the way. Yeah, good job. Good job firing robert solid. He was he was definitely the issue right there He was the problem. He was the problem like no, listen. Listen the whole organization is trash. Woody johnson's a horrible owner You know what? RJ because Woody johnson's kind of like jerry jones and that he gets and he really Decides the deals. He does the trades and all that shit. I'm not sure if you're aware of that I didn't know that He's he just like he's just not as famous as jerry, right? So he doesn't get the the press and the kind of media attention that jerry does but he does that. This is why they're trash Uh, woody johnson is garbage erin rogers is just fucking mid at this point. He's not good enough to overcome a bad organization Uh rogers is kind of like in like if you if I put Kirk cousins here, they would equally be as shitty Yeah, it's one of those situations where rogers needs a good organization because he he himself is like rogers isn't a leader. Let's be honest Uh rogers is uh, just rogers. He's kind of a dickheaded for being honest And he's just not good enough. This isn't primary rogers. And by the way, I like the fact that you lost to the Patriots that that is that is Listen, it is a divisional game, right? We seen I seen firsthand what divisional games can do but at the same time At the same time, bro, it's just like if this is what they're fourth They're on a four or a third three game losing streak I think so someone around there Like you have rogers you have hall you have gary wilson you have uh, Adams like you have uh, That other nigga behind hall who who wasn't there other running back those for me Yeah, braylon allen like You shouldn't be this bad bro and defensively y'all were actually decent until you fired Well, it was just hilarious Say what you want about robber solid two things can be true. He can be a bad head coach But he knows how to coach his ass off on defense Yes, and I know this has nothing to do with the game and For some reason 49ers fans don't want robber solid back. I don't know why have you seen your defense? Are they still losing to that? Yeah, it's like 10 to 6. I mean it's still the cowboys and that but still It is what it is Uh patrots this does nothing for you either way. Uh drake may got injured. I'm assuming because they put jacobre set out there, so Listen, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, what happened to drake made did he get injured or did he just say I'm assuming so because jacobre set was out there I don't see I was barely paying attention to this game. I was literally doing anything besides watching this game I had on my tv I was probably laying down taking a nap Why the fuck why I care about a jet or a patriot's game? uh It's what it is Fuck both these teams uh carnals and dolphins now uh carnals upset the dolphins 28 to 27 Very exciting game. See all your thoughts All right, I was rooting for the The uh carnals, right And I think I had them on the upset the week prior listen I like what they're doing. I like the I like what they're doing in um Arizona they're overachieving Yeah, uh, are they gonna do anything? No, no, hell no, uh, but it's a nice story, right? I mean, it's it's nice, you know to see Kyler Murray, you know who who's unfortunately been dealt to a shit organization You know actually looked somewhat decent like I said RJ if he wants to a good organization. I think he'd be a lot better um listen Joe Miami yo this fraud mcdaniels So bad. He's so bad. Get this bum off the team. Uh, to a bro. I mean To first of all tool wasn't it to begin with and I think I think we we said that for a minute the only thing with two is he's kind of like he's kind of that uh old school kind of Kirk Cousins quarterback Yeah, where it's kind of like he's just he's as good as the players around him And he has a lot of good talent, but the thing is mcdaniels is an idiot I think people thought he was gonna be Kyle Shanahan and by the way Kyle Shanahan's an idiot if you're watching the game So he came from the same tree as the idiot. So of course he's gonna be worse and They just have to blow this shit wide the fuck open if you know what if if i'm the gm rgeri, you know what I do What i'm moving Tyree kill right now Yeah, because I I can get a first for him Yeah, so i'm moving him right now. I'm moving Tyreek I'm moving uh, let's see I'm moving Up I'm moving Tyreek. Maybe not waddle because waddle is young Yeah, um I'm oh jail and ramsey. I'm moving him in a heartbeat. Jalen's gotta go Shubs going where he most of the going rolling. Yeah, everything's for sale And if you want waddle, you're willing to give me like two first and we can probably talk about that Like everything is up for sale. I'm blowing this shit wide the fuck open and i'm getting me Uh, listen, I'm not a big fan. I'm not the biggest fan of of shadore, but They probably could be in a position where they could wrap him Yeah, it's not a bad move Better than what they can do now. So But you agree just blow it up, right? Yeah, blow it blow it up and I have a video about tool coming out looking at it from a different perspective of him returning um Is what it is there uh shout out to kyler boomer sooner shout to marvin harrison, you know what i'm saying Uh, good to see those guys are clicking like they're supposed to be Uh speaking of that ceo, uh bills blow out the seahawks anyone shocked here Seahawks suck. All right. I mean Mavericks, ceo, you might as well just call mic mcdonald See if he wants to do the job. He should get pay. Yeah, that's right. They're they're mid four and four What's gonna happen is they're gonna probably move off a gno after this here, rightfully so Yeah Um, that's about it until they get rid of gno. I don't want to hear. I don't want to talk about this team Josh allan through his first pick. He's not an mvp. Go fuck yourself. Um Right now I mean you can make an argument for jared golf, but not allon. Go fuck yourself. Anyway, uh, this game is pretty much over with Yeah, uh once again Charges beat the saints. I don't know if yah is in here. Yah your boy rillers a fucking bomb Oh, he's son. Listen, we have a rule rj. We have a general rule, right? Yeah That we don't uh, oh wait you said, uh You man, you man. Yeah, we have a rule that we don't Take rookie seasons that seriously, right? I'll take rookie quarterbacks. That's seriously unless they're un utterly garbage No, no, no, no, but we we generally stick to that rule Yeah But this is the first exception. I think we made ever because rattler's so bad Besides bragg show. Yeah. Yeah besides bragg show. Yeah, and like There are exceptions where we break that rule when they're like you said when they're so fucking trash That it's undeniable that they're not a good quarterbacks Has he has shown any flashes at all? Rattler's a third string quarterback. Maybe maybe if you rj you can develop him into a third string quarterback. How about that? Like bro, like you see I don't know if you see these clips But like there's like they did a documentary on him when back in high school in college All he did was shit on all of his teammates about how bad they were He's not good he's not good. I'm just CEO. He has talent. Yeah. I'm yeah. He has talent About time damn There we go. Oh good. All right, whatever A very exciting game CEO commanders beat bears 18 to 15 on a hail jalen jaden daniel see all your thoughts Uh, I mean, this was an interesting game. Obviously, I guess battle of the rookies. Yeah, um Offensively, it wasn't that big of it was kind of underwhelming Yeah, but you know, I'm always a sucker for a good defensive game CEO Um, yeah, I mean, yeah me too, but I guess the stars here are supposed to be Caleb and jaden so but listen uh jaden I would say pretty much outperform Caleb Yeah, but not by much not by much. Um honestly There's not really much you can get off this game I mean, it's too rookie organization. It's too rookie quarterback with Two two trash head coaches and two mid organizations Yeah, and these defenses are good. So you put rookies behind them, you know, so Oh, there's not much to say about this. I can't really take much away from this See, this is the difference between what means you are talking about jaden daniel's and Caleb have shown flashes of Being good in the league radler and bright shiong fucking suck dick Yeah, they do If you put radler and fucking bright shiong behind one of these teams, it's a blowout Like come on. Yeah. Yeah, that is true She's beat the raiders. Uh Is anybody shocked she's feeling the soup bowl. It is what it is I mean It's weird because the cheeses aren't really like destroying people. Yeah, but they just win They just don't care at this point. Yeah, they just don't care. Listen. This is good. You know, she's do what you're doing I guess do what you're gonna do until someone's actually good enough to stop you Yeah, that's a fact Uh broncos get destroyed the panthers is shocking No, no, man panthers panthers are not even a serious NFL organization at this point Yeah, chargers. It is what it is. I still stand by uh, just her being traded I don't know if you guys have looked at the stats if you guys think fucking uh, what's the name Alex Smith's the game manager. We'll look at just her. Herber's fucking stats. No, it was just In by the way, it's not what I don't like is I don't think herber's a bad quarterback. No, like I just don't I don't think first of all, yes, he's in a poverty organization And he's surrounded by nothing. He's surrounded by nobody. I mean, but he has no weapons Uh, which is by the way Huh? I mean who by the way would be winning my bet if we still had that going on Yeah, and by the way, damn lad had 111 yards today and two touchdowns. I think off of that game alone. I would have won the bet Listen, yeah Um, he's just not as good as people think he is that's my problem with him because we still have people Arguing for the fact that this thing is a top five quarterback when he's not. No, he's not And that's okay. He doesn't need to be a top five quarterback. He just needs to go to a good organization He should get traded. He should Um, because obviously I think people people already hate greg roman Like people are calling for his job and I and by the way Lamar won a super bowl with greg roman at the helm Not super bowl my bad. He won an MVP, right? He won an MVP with with bum ass Uh, with bum ass uh miles bokeh and as his number one receiver willy senead Right. So So you can't I can't really make excuses for herbert. Uh, other than Um, good luck. Hopefully you do get traded That way you can you know actually win some shit because let's be honest rj. What's his name? Harbaugh Like his style plays just so boring and and so Not good for for kind of like it's outdated, right? Yeah It's outdated so Yeah, it is what is there. Uh, and as we speak the 49ers are up 13 13 to 10 listen look Uh, I don't care who wins this game Dak and brock are beyond fucking horrible. These guys don't deserve the money that they're getting Like I don't like see a bro. This is beyond ridiculous. First of all, bop pretty fucking sucks. Okay Uh, we've been saying this for some reason bop pretty has these uh Rapid fan boys who love them and the 49ers listen Listen, just make one of my favorites Come true and go get Aaron rogers Just go get them I mean, will there be any slight drop off with Aaron and rock rock sucks? I mean my gosh Absolutely brock is an out of good quarterback. Um Like Like and by the way, and if he if they win this game, which I think they probably won't um It's because the NFC east is fucking trash Yeah, okay. I mean apart from I guess the eagles who are I think Um a little bit of fools gold Yeah, apart from them. I just there's I mean who else I'm the commanders are just learning how to win The johns are utterly horrible the the johns are the johns are fucking They're not an they're not an NFL organization either. So I mean It is what it is listen nine is If you don't like listen, I'm expecting you to win this game because it's the cobblies and uh, Dak Prescott is sorry at this point Oh, yeah speaking of that. He's he's sorry as well too, bro. Yeah. He's sorry. I mean, he's not He I mean if we're being honest, I think he's just out of the top 10 at this point All the way, I don't know the top the quarterbacks these days are so bad that he still might be in there, but he might be lower Yeah, yeah, he could be yeah, you're right about that. He's now see who was you put in the top 10 Hurts or Dak if you had to choose one Yeah, I probably go with hurts Uh off the simple because they both had weapons, right? They both had some success. Um I would put hurts only because I can run him like a full like a fucking power bag. Yeah, so I can kind of run him Uh, kind of like kind of like Lamar, but he's not Lamar. All right, but kind of like in that style where I can kind of If if I can kind of you know use his running like the stack Prescott run. Yes, but he's not as I think an effective runner as as hurts is so I would use him for that now. Is he In terms of passing. I think they're both pretty mediocre Yeah And they're both not exceptional quarterbacks in my opinion Oh You said in this asshole doesn't pick Oh So bad They do it right too Well, good thing I picked hurts and not that that would have made me look like a fucking phone Oh, you'll see how is he this fucking bad? Yo, yo good good thing I said Yo, are you watching the game? Yeah, I just saw it. I just saw it. You just threw it, right? Bro, if I would have picked that get to put him on top. I wouldn't look like a fucking clown. Thank god. I didn't do Oh, jack or jordan Oh, oh jordan. I like jordan like does jordan have a kind of a turnover issues a little bit, but he's way better uh He's Like if he's down he can come back like that is not that quarterback. He can't come back. He sucks I mean jordan, you know, he like when he throws a pick like you see what he's trying to like he'll take like he's a High-risk guy. You feel me? Yeah, but it's like with that. It's like you get high risk, but there's a very little reward Like my gosh, like well first of all that That throw was horrible, bro Oh, he was covered That's so bad Much pretty throw another oh here yo, this is This is the high-speed guy in the league And then he's in guess who in there you have the other guy who's about to be the next high-speed guy to me So that's what I tell him And people bro, and I and I some of you guys in the comments section bro. Listen, do you understand why? Listen as some people ask me why I don't like football. I love football. I love the sport of football I hate the nfl and I think ceo said it uh last week Baseball as a product on the field is supremely better than football especially the six club like This product is so bad. Yeah. Yeah, argie because I do like when it comes to sports, right? Like just the Like I think we both agree that football is better. Yes Well, when I was watching the world series and I was and I was actually getting into it Yeah, I was enjoying it Like I was like this is actually something I could get into if I actually decided to get into it Like it's not bad and the thing is it's not I don't feel with baseball. There's no like Like maybe the like oh, okay. Oh the umps sometimes the umps are pretty bad and strike some balls But apart from that there's really not Much controversy when it comes to baseball and then you add on the fact in at least baseball Wait, say what you want about the nba major league baseball They're trying to make their product better on the court and on the field this pitch clock is good. See yo that game was only two hours Yeah, baseball would be like three to four with this pitch clock. It's amazing Yeah, because it makes you adjustable Like now with the nfl you and you know, I'm gonna keep it real with you ceo I don't blame these refs because you gotta think ceo there the nfl is consistently changing rules every single fucking year So it's like the referees will get used to one thing it goes back to another they change this and change that This product is beyond fucking horrible. I'm so Like done with it. And by the way, uh speaking on the refs, right? Not only Not only yet. You're right. They It changes every year, but at the same time it's like they're they're they're only they're only employed half time Yeah So you're basically telling a bunch of part-time employees to go do a full-time job Yeah, it's bullshit. And if they fuck up it's gonna be on them And then people wonder why and I'm not trying to go down this conspiracy lane, but me and my boy were talking like if a ref is making like A little bit of money and someone says, hey, I'll give you more money than what the nfl's giving you to throw this game You don't think they'll do it and you know what I'll keep it real with you. I don't fucking blame them This is their livelihood, but the nfl being the cheap bastards that they are And but you know what guys I'll say this we need the nfl to fall Because it will make the product better the nfl has been dominating basketball and baseball their product is better We need the same thing with the nfl Stop with the rule changes. Stop with the turf. Stop with the overseas shit Stop with the ads stop overpaying these players like Brock perty and dak Just stop it Yeah, and who and give competent people to make the schedules, please. Jesus. Yes, stop adding games Putting giants on the fucking prime time Facts and then I think this week is a jets in texans. So I'm thursday night Yeah, who wants to see that like I don't want to see no jets Yeah, I was speaking of that CEO uh steels and giants tomorrow who you got Steelers brother fucking wipe in the clock with the Giants and CEO. I don't know if you know this daniel jones has six touchdowns zero interceptions on the road But zero touchdowns and four interceptions at home and this is on the road CEO So would you be putting your faith into daniel jones into brandon and fisk and daniel jones trained uh this week, CEO I rather play russian roulette than put my fucking faith in daniel jones I just read you off the stats of daniel jones on the road. You're still not gonna do it, bro Can you read me off the stats at daniel jones and prime time? I would love to hear those Okay, yeah, you got a point. I think all the role games. I don't think seattle was prime time I don't think the redskins were prime time I forgot who else they play on the uh browns wasn't prime time. Okay. So yeah, you got him plus they haven't played a defense on the road like the steelers I'll give you that the sailors have blown them out Yeah, I agree. Uh speaking of I was right. Uh texans jets. Uh, I think we both have the texan ceo The jets are being Superb, they're cooked They suck They have like maybe if they had robber sula, I might call for an upset But this defense is so fucking bad. Also Nathaniel hack it sucks. I don't know why erin rodgers likes this guy so fucking much So you have brice hall one of the best running backs in the fucking league You don't use him at all to No, you don't but you see even stay Wait, what? So I was gonna fire him. That's exactly why the why erin rogers fired him. So I blame rogers. This is all rogers fault I mean, oh, hold on. Tell me. Tell me. I'm not saying rogers. So I was a good coach But you know what w rober sula for one to fire this fucking bozo Yeah, absolutely. He was on a farm That's a And erin rogers came in to save the day for him for his buddy But you know destroy the jets organization simultaneously. So this is rogers fault Yeah, beyond stupid Uh falcons cowboys. I don't fucking know You have you have kurt and then kurt junior All right, so well, it's like 20 to 10. So apparently cowboys are cowboying. Yeah, so yeah, I'm gonna go with the falcons Uh, I think honestly, I think the better Team and honestly, let's be real. I mean at this point, would you rather have kirk or dak? Probably kirk. Yeah Yeah, that's what I'm saying always um hesitant to kirk is older But I mean prime for prime kirk definitely but kirk has his problems in prime time You know, I'm gonna go dallas, especially losing this they're on a losing streak and kirk being kirk He just asked how long is the seattle at home What a shock you have the cowboys being in my home. It isn't kirk like it isn't back on the feet against kurt too I have no idea Some are something like that I'm gonna go cowboys just to be different uh titans patriots Like if I was a fan, I wouldn't even watch this if I was a fan of those teams I wouldn't watch this game like the wmba probably has higher ratings than that in that fucking game um Bro, I mean This is literally like there's no wrong answer here. I'll take the titans Patres will be like, oh here we beat them and didn't have a letdown this week Bro, this is so bad like like you're I'm gonna go with the page. No, no, I don't want to go up it I'm gonna go with the patriots But I'm But I'm I'm begging the titans to to win so I can Destroy a certain fag in the discord, you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, uh, this should my end in the 1010 time Uh Raiders bingles, unfortunately, I got the bingles winning especially losing this week I think they have a comeback in the red is just fucking horrible. Yeah bangles Bangles are gonna win but they're cut either way. So it's all good Uh, Ravens Broncos obviously Ravens Broncos nice story rookie quarterback. Boy next looks pretty good But obviously Ravens at home losing to the uh browns Browns, you know, obviously this is a comeback win. Good get back game for Lamar and Henry Now, you know, like I will say this because we lost to the one in six browns with james Uh At least lamar and the offense are gonna come back are gonna come to play even though I think the defense is still gonna suck nuts Yeah, this might be like a 28 21 came right exactly That'll be fucking hilarious Browns and chargers I'm gonna go I'm gonna go chargers Browns nice win let down this week. I love you james, but no, sorry Yeah, I'm gonna go chargers. It was the browns being the rate was so fluky. I'm gonna go with the chargers Yeah, saints panthers saints. I mean Spencer Riley might be bad, but the same panthers whole organization is probably even fucking worse. So Oh, this is another First cowboys player with two interceptions and the three straight regular season games 92 dach presscott That's not making 75 million people. Yo the fact that they still Clowns that defend them bro I don't know how you defend. Hey listen, my McCarthy sucks, but that is even fucking worse, bro Bro, you have you have major cowboy youtube channels that still defend that like that's how bad it is Like whatever it is what is um Dolphins bills uh bills You have a Miami team. They could even win Miami this week. You have a Miami team coming to Buffalo Not great. I do think the game will be close because the bills games are always fucking close with Miami, but Going bills hit there uh commanders giants Oh Commander oh Man, I for some reason CEO dame jones always shows up against the commander. Oh come on. I'm done with that bum I pulled never put faith on him Oh, I know bro, but come on bro. Daniels is different. He's you know, he's He's breaking that trend I put see you can't Even this year against like the washington only beat the giants by fuel goals. Yeah, that is that is true But I feel like washington is gonna come out Try to prove to the the disgusting filthy giants that they're any worth with shit even though I hate the commanders more than giants But it's just like I can't like giants are just garbage, bro Like there's no way they're winning. There's the thing though. It's like if they lose this monday It's like bro. It's gonna be like uh, it's like and then the The uh commander's just won an emotional game. So it's like I can definitely see a lot down here You're going with the giants Everybody anybody who knows me knows I fucking hate the giants. I probably hate the giants more than any team in the league but Fuck it. Yeah, I was just gonna try it. Oh god This nigga that sucks I know Oh Anyway, um Jaguars. Well, you want to the you know, the eagles are facing like a stretch of bad teams. So is there To filly, uh, obviously filly. Yeah, filly is definitely gonna win this but like is it me or Or they they haven't like the easiest schedule right now They got a easy schedule. See I'll give them that Yeah, that's an easy ask like jaguars. Are you kidding me? Anyway Well eagles, you shouldn't be happy about this because it's probably means you're gonna keep uh, nick sarian so Yeah, nick. I don't care what people say. I know Nick gotta go. I don't care. Yeah uh bears cardinals I get the carnals just won but No, I mean they're on a two game winning streak. I feel if this is a letdown ceo. I just have a feeling about that So i'm i'm gonna go bears Bears would be the the better choice here because uh the defense And but i i'ma go cardinals for a three For a three game winning streak Yeah, uh wouldn't shock me. I'll uh, I mean I like Caleb but Kyle is my boy, but Be safe. I'ma go bears Uh ram seattle. I'ma go rams rams seem like they picking up steam seattle's horrible agreed rams So is what is lines packers now If jordan love is injured i'ma go lines, but if he's not i'ma go uh packers I think ceo's either going lines either way I would have gotten lines either way if they don't have if they don't have love again There is ceo. This is a dome team going to uh green bay in in november. Yeah, so With willis at quarterback Well, i'm talking about if love is there Uh, I think a growing injury takes like one or two weeks at least so i'm i'm i'm i'll probably assume Yeah lines Is what is uh colts vikings they flexed this game I think they took out the jets and the texans and replaced it with the vikings and colts why I don't know Uh my god, I don't want to see anthony richardson fucking throw for 23 yards and three interceptions Well, I mean, yeah, we're gonna go vikes here. Yeah vikings. Yeah, listen bro. No No vikings all the way this Whoever made this like rj this is like even though we didn't know anyone like any of the how good these teams were going to be right This is a bad pronton game now and it was a bad game before they made the before the season Yeah, no they flexed this game in there. They replaced it. No those eagles philly first No those eagles and jacksville and they flexed at the four and put the vikings and colts Why did they flex that shit? Yeah, why don't you put the lions and the packers there? I mean Falcons and fucking uh the falcons the cow was we've got in this shit. Okay. Is there any A part like go go back. I want to see is there any game worse than the colts and the vikings and pronton Oh, yeah, yeah the never mind the patres and titans and saints and panthers are worse Um, but if you're gonna flex the game like I'd rather see I'd rather see fucking packers lions Ram seattle that might be you know In admittedly, this is a horrible schedule. I mean this week is horrible And we can add that on to the reason why the NFL sucks horrible schedule Like is there any like if we look at this right now that now that like lines packers was the best game Of that week is best game hands down and now that love is injured. It's I'm not even that interested in three hours. Um, Yeah So apart from that game, is there any game on that on the schedule that you were like, oh, I want to watch it like look at it I mean, yeah, but I mean, it's okay. I rather I mean falcons cowboys might be interesting. Uh Bill's no bill's dolphins. I mean that might be a close one divisional game CEO How I'm gonna take it this commanders giants that might be that might be uh That might I'm saying compared to the Vikings and Coles these these are better games Honestly, I probably would rather watch Bears Cardinals and Coles Vikings I agree with that and then we ended off on Monday night. Uh, We ended up with the Monday night, uh bucks chiefs chiefs This game would have been really good if Godwin and Evans didn't get injured Yeah But yeah, it's chiefs hands down Yeah chiefs it is what it is. Uh, net you that your guys is a gaily dose of any NFL Uh, what's good tides? How you doing? What's good? Uh, josh johnson was good. Uh, grow him out scott What's good NFL productions On ceo, let's talk a little basketball and unfortunately Brandon's not here to review the Celtics and nicks game that happened Tuesday last Tuesday. I'll see your thoughts on the Celtics nicks My thoughts on the Celtics nicks is first of all Brandon owes me 50 bucks. All right. That's one He owes me 100 because the johns are about to finish fourth and after and he'll owe me 150 after the Celtics sweep I'm not sweet, but win We're smart like betting against Brandon, but this guy has no job. So we're kind of done for this shit Yeah, that is true At least we get a bragging over him. I'm being a dumbass listen What can I say Celtics are as dominant as they were last year They look really good Jason Tatum looked even better than he did last year At least in the debut it looks like it looks like his um Three-point game is a lot better Looks a lot cleaner now Yeah Like hurry out there. Shit. Yeah, he like rj if he can get a consistent three going bro. It's It's gonna be really I don't think anyone can stop them if he can shoot There's no prosingus out there and there was no prosingus. That's right and our big man that game was uh, I think uh, what's that? That white boy, um Number 40, right? Yeah. Yeah And al-harford You know and harford i'm surprised he didn't retire um He didn't look that bad out there. Let me see you got a chance to get a second. Why would you retire? Uh, listen, this team is really like white like, you know, the back bonus team is white in holiday. I think they're like We're gonna get them about what they did the cat Yeah, they're so like they are I know listen. I know everyone loves to talk about brown and Tatum, but but white and um holiday are like they they are really the back on the team in terms of Like they do all the dirty work Like they're the people that that uh, play the hardest defense they they do all the They try to do all the steals like they get really down and dirty defensively It's they do all the dirty work and it's it's a beautiful thing like getting holiday and trading away smart was the best thing the The the Celtics could have done so Um, I like to see them. I don't see it. I don't really think it needs anything I think it's fine the way it is the chemistry is really good. Missoula is a really good head coach And you know, and we were really critical of him early on um Because we didn't like the way the Celtics kind of did, uh, uh, you may write But honestly, I'm starting to think they they were just looking for an excuse to get rid of them Um, because It's a grown-up like he made him doka the coach. He's not a grown-up Missoula grown up But I can yeah, exactly, but I can see I think they they were looking for some bullshit to get rid of them And this was it because I don't think they really care about what was going on there So I really think they were like, oh no, we got to move off of them. That's what they did and and and plus I really like Missoula's ethos I like his What he stands for Uh, very stand-up individual Um, you know, I like I like Missoula a lot. So I think we're in a good place As for the Celtics, I mean as for the not the Celtics the nicks um I don't know some of the players look off to me I don't know who who it was, but Someone was was chucking up balls and looked retarded doing it. Um I don't know who that was That was uh shooting balls and he looked stupid doing it. But uh, I mean It was bridges. Yep. Yeah, he I don't know what the fuck that was he was doing but Uh, whatever the hell he was doing looked funky. Shit You know, this is obviously after uh, this is obviously after uh, you know, the nicks dominated the pieces which how burns a bum zero points To assist, you know what I'm saying, but I want to talk about this game, right ceo. Yeah listen I I know people are hyped that how that cat had a good game against the paces and everybody knows the paces are fucking frauds They're fucking soft. So I'm not gonna hype that up This dude cat was getting bodied by juhau day in fucking derrick white Our center's getting bodied by two fucking guards ceo who are not even above six three The they're six three and he's like supposedly like six eleven seven foot, right? Yes and they're They're just out working him Bodying him pushing him back. No fucking way, bro I'm watching that game and I'm like, bro My gosh, I don't How's that how's that type of Like so any team that's gritty, let's say like miami or something Yeah, anything that has any type of grit like he'll just fold like a fucking launcher Absolutely hundred percent That's why I'm friday the paces have no grip Like fucking uh, oh my gosh, this dude, um I can't he doesn't he doesn't fit the budo system though. That's the thing. He doesn't fit He never fitted it. We've seen it in minnesota. He never fucking fitted it. He doesn't fit the culture, right? So So why see there? Why did thibbano say it would green light that bullshit? It's leon and I don't know I see I I I don't know if it was dibs exactly But I'm gonna tell you but if dibs did have something to do with it because I mean the coach has to Greenlight it to see if it fits the system. This is kind of like once again I'm gonna go back to my analogy that brought back last week We have the nicks expert brandon on here when I said it's like you date a girl you break up with her You haven't seen her for like two or three years and you try to date her again And you realize how fucking crazy she is. This is this is the same exact thing that's gonna happen with the nicks Cat is not it Yes, the nicks will make the playoffs. Yes, we'll go to the second round, but we seen it last year cat just gets body Like yep, you just put a little bro. Derek white and juhade they're obviously there's They're like midges compared to cat, but they just literally put a little pressure put a little Aggression on cat he followed up like a damn long chair Yeah Can you imagine it even though and be this soft but in being bodies cat every time he sees them Yannis bodies cat every time he sees them So it's like my gosh, what the fuck are we doing here bro? mackayl I I'm done with the villanova boys. Fuck him. I'm I'm done with this shit, bro. I just I feel like First of all Getting rid of Of divin chenzo. Yeah, I didn't like that move Like randall. I don't care about randall because I think he sucks. Yeah Uh, cat like I say he doesn't fit the system. Is that the best they could do? I guess but what we'll have to see is the Season progresses, but I could I could see a situation where Like brunson just yells that cat because he's doing some bitchy shit Like I could I could see a situation Where he gets angry with cat because he's not hustling hard enough or something like that Or fucking josh hard most likely Or josh hard ray. I could I could see a situation or scenario where that happens I just I don't think cat is cat is someone with a lot of talent and zero intangibles Facts he's literally just a tall version of Ben Simmons. Me honest, dude Uh, brunny sends in a g league seal your thoughts Uh good He should be sent to this g league. He's not good Uh, he's not good. I mean brunny was should never see the court. He only got if if his name if if his last name was in james He would be flipping burgers right, I mean Listen for development reasons. He should stay in the g league For like two three years, honestly for being honest probably won't be that long but he should be down there for a long time and That's what I say. I mean, he's not ready. He was never ready for the uh NBA he should have stayed in college But you know for some reason uh lebron has a fantasy he wants to fulfill in his mind So I guess that's why he was rushed into it Yeah Shout the brunny, you know, this is this is gonna be his college state playing against g leaguer So I mean that's good for him if he's gonna become anything he might as well do that so Uh and being being investigated by the NBA for load managing. Uh, listen look in beads a fucking clown We can all agree to that Yeah Um, you know shout to the NBA for at least trying to do something about this load managing bullshit You know, they made the rules saying you have to play at least 65 games to win a major award Uh, you know, so shout to the NBA for at least trying to attempt to stop this bullshit. I'll see all your thoughts Um, I like it because I'm tired of the load management bullshit. Yeah Like the league either needs to cut down the games Find a different model of revenue in order to Remain profitable because first of all if if if if 82 games is too much For players bodies and they should cut it down because It would be unfair for them to keep getting injured but like but I'm pretty sure they have studies where enough players Pass the season playing the majority of the season Michael the michael jordan error they played and they didn't have the shit that they have now they played Fucking 82 games The whole load they're they're they're first of all that's the only good thing about football that Load management doesn't exist. Yeah Load management and basketball is just I'm not saying it comes across to at least the audience the viewers as lazy Yeah, like if you're not injured if you're not If you're injured stay okay stay off the bench if you're not injured you should be playing Like that's the whole point. That's why you get paid if you're not injured You should be playing load management is basically them either faking injury to some degree Yep To stay oh my my ankles a little sore like it's nothing's wrong with it But I feel a little it feels tender. So I'm gonna give a this game off to him beat so he can sit down to avoid any injury That's bullshit. They just don't want to play this season. They only want to play games that matter Yeah So they either need to cut down the games or the you need to start finding players for stop being for uh being lazy fucks Because that's exactly what that is Yeah, and now these next two topics. I really want to talk about uh number one I want to expose adam silver for being a dirty jew uh The simple fact that tnt is in his last year is utterly disgusting I hate adam silver now, you know credit to him for helping the field on the court Or helping the product on the court but off the court adam you are a fucking retard Why in the blue fuck would you get rid of? Inside the mba and see yo, I want to I just want to let you know This is the year 2024. It's not 2014. It's not even it's not 2004. It's not 1994. You know the prime uh New show whatever it's gonna be is gonna be a lesbian black woman Uh spineless white guy some black stimp and another black angry woman who wishes she was a black man Right. So no, I'm not jewish Uh, so and I hate let me stop Uh, so listen, this is utterly disgusting and you have people like terry and see yo who love jews for some reason I don't know why but I oh, yeah I don't Oh, yeah, I do love jews. That's sure that I love jews. That's right so But why and then see yo not only that To charles barkley, you know charles barkley doesn't hold his mouth I know you said some bullshit here and there, but he doesn't hold his mouth TNT came out and said we matched the offer offer them more and said take a game off and give us less playoff series And they still said no They've been working with t&c in the Warner Brothers since 1987 So the 80s 90s 2000 2010s to that it's been five decades. You've been working with this fucking company and you say no for amazon Why do people love amazon so fucking much? Can we just go back to the days where amazon was just something where you order shit off of I'm first of all, I mean back in the old days amazon was like a bookstore mainly Let's go back to that. Let it be a fucking online barns and noble This is where you have and we all know thursday night's just away from the get monday night and more playoff more NFL games now they're getting NBA games too And and I want everybody to realize this and I'm gonna shout to my uncle for telling me this I'm gonna say it right now. You guys do realize that streaming is getting more and more and more and more and more Uh costing more and more and more which means cable wants to get their head out their ass is gonna realize. Oh, wow With all these streaming sites like netflix youtube tv p cop amazon prime with them going up We can lower our prices and people will come back to cable But if all these sports networks are on stream and they're gonna my fuck Everybody's on cable and by the way looking at it cable still has a big A name in house and houses people still watch All these sports events on cable at large numbers. So for you to put them all on streaming sites. It's like what the fuck Yeah, it's usually the old people Yeah, that's a watch it on cable, but Let's see. Oh, my theory is like with all these streaming sites going up and up cable has a golden opportunity Let's lower our prices more people will come Yeah, that's probably what's gonna happen Uh to be honest with you because here's the thing They're giving one game to this streaming site one game to that streaming side And it's like how many streaming services are you gonna have to sign up for right? And that's it costs even fucking more. Yeah, it's like $15 here $10 here Uh 20 there. I mean, it's kind of like well at that point At that point I might as well just pay cable and just have one monthly bill Yeah, that's that's a that's a whole fact. So you got you have one on for the nfl peacock amazon Uh regular the regular tv uh paraman has one Like how many You listen, I know people in the chat love football, but you can't love football that fucking much Especially if it's not your team I mean my gosh, bro like this It's gotten so bad that you got nfl players illegally streaming should now Yeah, thanks. Didn't you say someone uh was it I forgot you put in a discord someone was illegally streaming something Yeah, it was an I think it was tyreek woollen from the sea uh sea ox. He was illegally streaming a Fuck game. So I'm like even so you taught me these fuckers who are millionaires don't even fucking pay for For the streaming service. So why the fuck are we gonna pay for the stream service? If in the product is bad there's no football is bad friday football is bad The product itself is bad It's not worth the money at one point like You know, maybe we're just getting old ceo because I missed the days god rest my father and my mother's soul Where they will pay the cable and I can watch All the football all the basketball want it would just be one cable thing now We got to subscribe here subscribe there get a free trial here get a vpi here enough enough Like come on man Yeah, and I don't need that it's like once you sign up every year it goes up like a dollar or two dollars or three dollars Right, that's how $5 that was like 20. Yeah, it's like 20. Yeah, really. Yeah, it used to be five bucks And now it's 20 dollars and I think over the course of like five years. It's really got amazon prom went up in price too Yeah, that went up in price youtube tv, which i'm paying for went up in price. Like listen cable cable You have a golden chance here With all people already complaining people are already illegally You know streaming and when it comes to illegally streaming stuff, you know, you have buffering a lot of people watching the quality's not good You're delayed you have a chance to lower your price. You have a chance here to fight back. Don't fuck it up Facts or I mean do you Yeah, that's the fact. Yeah, mba is going on peacock too. I forgot about that shit Peacock first of all peacock sucks. I got like a I pay for the subscription one time to try it. Yeah Nothing to watch it's fucking trash. Yes, this reruns of shows that you can watch anywhere like like peacock, I think I don't know if it's mbc's uh Yeah, I think it's mbc's a platform ramp. Yeah, but it's just like literally peacocks shows consist of Of shit. I never heard about like Literally, bro. If you go on peacocks uh network, right And and I and I put something like like Like wwe 205 live who cares about that shit?

So it just sucks like This you know, see, maybe you know, maybe like, you know, you watch jason willow Maybe willow has a point maybe sports is just dying out like the product is beyond watered And i'm telling all sports. That's just football, but just like there's no roots to these sports anymore I mean Yeah, you gotta appreciate it, bro Yeah, shout out to jordan NFL production says I got peacock because it was free. I mean, that's fine. Hbl max. Yeah, I heard that was good I didn't have max for a while. I think I would agree. It's one of the better streaming services uh But listen here here's the thing with sports. So like football Like Like I'm gonna just have to be honest. I feel like And I know this sounds fucked up, right But it's the fact it's like the truth Like the the reason people like football is because you you watched people get fucked up on the field Yeah And now it's kind of taboo to say that right so yeah Like I used to love watching ray luis clothes line chat out your sinko and his helmet would fly off like That's what people like to watch. I mean And I know it's bad for the player's health I know it's it's not it's not Uh humane, let's just say right. Yeah, but it's one of those things where it's kind of like people watch this sport because of hit sticks And because like how many like you're when you were a kid. What was your favorite thing to do in madden? Hits stick people Thanks, like that was the fit like it now Anytime someone gets hit it's like, okay. Where's the flag? I mean, it's not a it's not an enjoyable product It's more like football is less of what it used to be now. It's more like a chess game like a game of chess But with live people Yeah, thanks And also can I say this to People the same people who sit here and uh, we'll sit here and say oh, it's not humane and stuff like you have seen like boxing And also this is not all football is is a even back when it was very physical It's a watered-down version of gladiators Back in the world footballs always existed whether we call them gladiators Whether it was the roman calcium. This is always existed now great Like do we want to see guys get hurt and have all these messed up injuries? No, but at the same time It's like come on let me see you aren't saying let's go back to the 60s where you're a lot of slam guys on the On the net defense hit somebody Yeah, and josh jones at disney plus sucks stop it Oh Come on josh. Why did I have a feeling you you would like disney, bro? Yeah, disney plus is horrible and he's I'd like HBO, you know, they used to have good boxing coverage on there, but ever since floyd left they really haven't but Trust me. I these streams that suck So I hate this with a passion Uh speaking of things that we hate with a passion uh, erin boom okay Oh And erin and erin judge. Oh my god judge bro erin Ironically both name erin Listen listen I don't care. See how much it cost whatever one soto wants. He gets yep this Stay I don't know why givani stan gets all this hate at least he at least he ties up the games That's more than we can say about this overrated bum that mean and mean ceo did a podcast about this I think a year or two ago when he was gonna get paid me say listen Judges is a good player in the regular season, but when it comes to the playoffs, especially in the second round and beyond He disappears. We're seeing it in prime time right now He's bro. He's like he's rustle. Westeros Like James Hardin probably James hard like This dude strikes out at the most pivotal moments of the game He'll get a star like you couldn't count in I was like, yep Like I go I watch him go up in the plate instead of being like, oh my god. This is an mvp This is a 60 homer guy, right? I'm thinking they're like, oh, here we go Here comes the three strikes are out and right on point like It's that's what happens. It's strike out after strike. I'm like He's a choker Yeah, he's he's a choke artist. How many years has to go by before people realize it. He's a choker. Okay, and honestly Uh, if you can't rely on them, then we're kind of handicap And I'm there's no way I'm letting Juan Soto walk out that door without offering a billion dollar contract No fucking way. No fucking way, bro. I'm so you No, no you sign them You sign them and then you see and if you lose the series you see what you can get for judgment. I'm dead serious Like I I I know he's supposed to be this uh Yankee icon, right? But at this point like can you really be a Yankee icon without doing shit in the post season? No, oh speaking of that People shit on uh my boy Alex Rodriguez. First of all Yes, Alex Rodriguez, you know, he has his intangible problems, but I don't give a fuck what anybody says back in 2010 Derek Jeter Mariano Vera all them boys were below 500 if not 500 that whole season Alex gets back from his suspension starts smacking shit out the park smacking shit out the playoffs He was a big pivotal part to that fucking team judge is nowhere near Alex Smith uh Alex, uh, Alex Rodriguez nowhere near him This is beyond like judge just looks scared. Yeah, he does. He's just looks scared when he's at the plate That's not an MVP right there. That's not a franchise player. That's a bitch Yeah, that is true Like my gosh And boom, you're not off the hook too. What what is up with the rotations of these pictures? My gosh What why why in the world, you know, Aaron judge has a problem in the clutch Why do you not put state in or fucking Juan Soto? uh after him Bass is loaded. I rather have state in there at least staying can get walks Yeah, at least he can get someone to base This dude judge can't do shit. He can't even get hit And if he does get a hit the damn foul Listen, I don't Well, there's no if the if the Yankees If the Yankees don't win this series now with you know, show hey othani going down what you know unfortunate We hope he does good with him going down that gives us a big opening chance. You know take these next three games at home but Bro, there's no way i'm letting seal. There's no way we can let stand walk out the door. There's no like No soda There's no way we can let him walk out this door without offering a huge contract. There's no way. No way if we don't have soda we're cut We're for fucking cooked, bro No, no, he's not leaving. They're not they're not letting him leave without no, they're not letting him leave They they can't go they can't not looking at what they have in fucking judge. Hell no, they can't live I don't know. Let's say Yankees like And it's Aaron boom like we And you know, it's crazy right now that he's made the world series now they justify him now keeping him now Yeah, that's only bad thing but bro Yankees you guys love your old players Who's one of the best old players that they have dairy jeeter dairy jeeter has been shitting out of this guy since he's been on the fucking team, bro Come on, bro. Yeah, I mean my gosh Listen to jeeter Bro, this oh my god, this clown deck almost threw a third interception. Yeah. Oh my god. He sucks so Anyway, I did thought that was property who was still in the ball I didn't even know I didn't even know the cowboys were on offense but Like listen to dairy jeeter jeeter has been saying this since 2013 that he doesn't know rotations He doesn't know ball. Why is he still your gm 10 fucking you jeeter retired in 2014? It's been 11 fucking years, bro Like what are we fucking doing here, bro And people are like, oh, who are you gonna replace him with any fucking body? This is stale. He's the giant horrible of the Yankees. This is yeah He's just a horrible of the Yankee like it's stale he and my gosh, dude, but you had Oh Bro, if we didn't have one solo this this we would have got bound we'd have been been bounced, bro Yeah, I mean if it was up to judge we would have been bouncing in round one Like come on, bro. That's the fact the We could have lost to the guardians. We could have lost to the Padres My gosh, though at some point enough enough Enough's enough if you're gonna you can't keep one you either get rid of judge or get rid of Aaron Both these guys should not be on the team next year Yeah, and one solo should get both their paychecks to be honest with you Yeah, I think I just have a weird feeling that we're gonna like one low walk. I'm gonna be so tasteful No, we're not we're not gonna let him walk if we let him walk we're not seeing another fucking series You cannot go this is our first world series in what what? 15 years You cannot let this guy walk. I'm sorry. You can't you can't you got to offer him something You don't both you don't let him leave the fucking Building without giving him a blame check. You don't let him leave until he signs the fucking contract, bro I mean bro, listen. I just just trying to get him. No, that's soto and uh, shouhei. That's over. It's over. It's fucking no no, listen, uh, first of all, there's nothing more prestigious in in In sports Like in general sports and being a Yankee player, right? And that and by the way for those who are saying, oh the america's team Dallas Cowboys. Look at that shit product. Okay, listen Nothing's more prestigious than being Yankees player plus Uh They're gonna take care of him financially. He's good. He said I don't think he want but where else is he's gonna go? I mean the dodgers fuck the dodgers. I mean if it's taxes, it's high taxes over there, too I Don't know world He's good. We're gonna pay him. There's no way they let him walk No fucking way to let him walk. I don't see it happening I'm praying to god Don't happen man. Well, I'm surprised my favorite player on the team keep me honest with you That um, is that where I'm that volpe dude, right? Yeah. Is he supposed to be good? He's all right because he replaced jeter, right? Yeah I don't know. He looks at me to me. I'm just I was hit the ball only judge. So I'll say that Yeah, yeah, that's sad man. Fuck fuck judge bro. Unless unless I see some kind of uh, one of the best world series performances out of judge I want him gone like I'm listen. I'm okay with keeping judge because I feel like judge will benefit like, okay. I got one and I got Stay in here to help me and especially they're coming before If I'm Aaron boom, I'm like, you know what maybe if one and fucking uh Stand are coming after judge. Maybe he won't feel that much pressure And maybe he'll hit him. He'll get some walks. He'll get some he'll get uh some singles and some doubles But you put him at the most Pressure-wise fucking position. Uh, gals is scored All right So it's 1727. So we'll see what happens there But you know, maybe if he feels like he has someone behind him that's better than him or he can bail him out Then maybe he'll do better or leave him But instead Aaron's like, you know what we're gonna leave judge out there You know as our last rotation because he's a big hitter. No the fuck he's not No Come on, bro Like I'm sorry like why is Aaron boom on a fucking team, bro? Like my gosh This dude is just a read like this dude for you like Derek He has been saying it for fucking years. This guy's a fucking retard Yeah, I remember when When people were calling for Joe Gerardi job Yeah Uh, because it got because he got stale So I miss Joe Gerardi right now. I mean, yeah, he's better than fucking boom. I'll say that Like boom sucks and Jesus even when he was with the Florida Marliners, he still loved the Yankees. I don't know if you saw it But there was a clip of I think G. Uh, it was the cast of uh Fox they have a cast of alechor Egas david artis and Derek which is a good cast It's kind of like inside the envy. I love that cast But Mets mascot came up to them and Derek Jeter walked off the set. That's how fucking loyal this guy He's been retired for 10 years and he walked off the set when he saw that dirty ass baseball walk up to him Yeah So if Derek Jeter say he's ass, you know, it's in his best interest. He's a Yankee for life Hell, I would have Jeter as the manager the fucking uh, boom Yeah, boom. Yeah, you know, it's bad when you're in the world series and people are so tired of facts Uh, so, you know, it is what is uh Yankees you guys play tomorrow get it done man. We gotta win these next three games We especially if if we lose and shohai otani's out work, we're cooked Oh, yeah, that would make the situation so much worse Yeah, so Uh, they hired the sculptors off team. We had to oh Fuck the way we I don't give a fuck about him This statue is well, you know, what's up with these mba statues cove statues sucked the Wayne Wade statues sucked So what are we doing here? First of all, we shouldn't be making statues of human beings They're just humans. Okay, the Wayne's a basketball player So yeah, yeah, yeah, like yeah, I mean, yeah, that's a good point like Like I'd rather give a world-class surgeon a statue than a fucking than a fucking um Some dude that dribbles a ball fuck No, so speaking of it. Can I just see here and say uh, CEO, uh The Wayne ways like I'm sorry. I still can't go with that. This guy was a shooting guard. He can't shoot But am I the only one that like bought didn't bothers me Like Like can you name a shooting guard that couldn't shoot CEO? Jordan can shoot Kobe can shoot James Hardy can shoot Allen Iverson can shoot even though he was the one but he was mainly a two donovan Mitchell getting Booker That's crazy Hell Derek White can shoot come on, man Now the Wayne Wade's a good player not no denying that but he's more of a furry than a two so Here's what it is. But uh, blue jays are ass. I agree with that. But the blue jays, you know nothing. Oh Because Jordan uh, friends said I picked the dollars to win because I hate the Yankees as a blue jay Your blue jays fans are Jordan Francis. I did not know that That's unfortunate Jordan Yeah Some blue jays are are they poverty? They got a few uh, do they have one world series? I know they won one in the early 90s when they first came in but I don't think they won one sense Go Oreos tear your Oreos fan. How the fuck are you a fillies in an oros, man? Yeah, it's weird I was speaking to that. Uh, they have two. All right, so I guess they're not poverty No, I mean, no, I think we have to have a different conversation about poverty in baseball over football, right? Because in football the most Chips the team has a six right now, right? Okay, so yeah, so if you have two that's pretty pretty poverty. Yeah, that's part because the Yankees have 27 so That's poverty Well, we can't compare any team to the Yankees. So like we have to go off the Cardinals, which is 11 So maybe like four if you have four world series, you're not poverty and basketball. How many of the cells does have 18? Yeah, 18. Yeah, I think so. So maybe three You have at least three Right here because we had just because yeah, the only one In football we have a low standard because the highest team has six Yeah Uh, yo scooter make gricker is the most illusion fan I ever seen. I don't know who the fuck that is You know who scooter is CEO scooter. My gritty. I don't who he is He's a he's a cowboys. He's a he's a uh entertainer That's the best you put it Who who's the who loves the cowboys, you know, you know cowboys Bro, I don't know why bro. If I'm a Dallas fan. I just want to blow shit up Oh, this is not gonna happen until Jerry's dead. So this is what is there? And even then Stephen Jones is probably oh my god, bro, this is And by the way, just be okay nine or just because you're whooping on the cowboys that y'all still ain't shit either Broncos poverty. No Broncos have like three or four championships Yeah, they have I think they have three three championships. Yeah, they won two without way won't pay them. So Scooter's basically like Michael well, that's I don't know what Michael's take was On that, but you know Grim off Scott Grim off can I ask the question? Why is your profile picture a picture of James Harden who's a Travis Scott? Yeah, sorry, Scott Why is your profile picture this? Yeah, that's an L. That's an L to be honest Like Travis Scott Stateness and James hardens a choker. No, I mean like I was I forgot about that. I was talking about like James Harden sucks Like why would you have a profile picture? No, uh, uh, shit Yo, Master J the whole you rooting for the 90s shit just doesn't see right Yeah, it's kind of game master J Just do what rg doesn't just don't pick another team if you don't want to be you see how upset ceo is This is the benefit of not having a team Like shout out to fizz vegas, you know, we got him on the pod one of these days. He's suffering on his giant channel right now Oh, sorry, it's just it's just uh, the the whole uh The whole realization that dames jones is trash and now he has to convince his own fan base that he's trash is hilarious Yeah, dames jones sucks. This is so damn funny. I watch every week. Well, your eagles been a question I mean Yeah, that's yeah, he is funny. That's why we watch him but Uh, listen, I don't know. I like if you're a giants fan like I seen a hope rj Like what's the hope if you're a giants fan. Well, what's hope like you're gonna you're about to get denny tomorrow by the Steelers Yeah, and next year you're gonna draft like quinney worse Carson back like do you have me like what's hope like i'm literally looking at a five seven year stretch rj of being ass Yeah, they're not getting arch either Like we're gonna be in our 30s and they're gonna be ass Yeah, that's a fact. Yeah But I said I see I said it there. I said it at the time when I said it said it now If they don't draft the quarterback this draft, I don't care how good marvin malik Uh, joe oh is quarterback. You need a quarterback And look look what they're doing now Look look where it's at now. They believe the daniel jones again And like come on man. Hey, um What's it called a grill mouse cop Honestly, I don't think malik is your hope because um Every time I see malik getting interviewed he it feels like he hates being there, bro Yeah, he bro. See yo, see yo this Even with that See yo, bro Anytime the giants get a flashy player. Yeah, they always leave odell sake one. It's gonna be the same thing with malik Yeah, the only difference with sake. I mean with not sake one with odell, right? Yeah Is that yeah odell was flashy? You know, he was a little controversial slightly, right? Yeah, but He it looked like he wanted to be there. He was at least smiling. He was at least Talking to the fans. He it looked like he wanted to be there, right? Even if y'all suck But malik actively looks like he's depressed me Would you be I mean, yeah, I would be but he doesn't want to be there. He doesn't like the giants. It's so obvious Didn't see oh, didn't you say he was on my instagram live in la saying y'all I love la. I can't wait to live here Yes, that's why I fucking guys bro anyone who saw draft night that man was depressed When the giants called his name that dude had a serious face I would I mean bro because the charges took joe over over him, which you know is respectable But it's like he's like, okay, the number five You know, I'm gonna be having justin herber in jim harball Instead you have brian dable and they And now you're gonna have fucking brian dable and quen yours Yeah, I mean Or Carson back But the point is I feel like any opportunity that he might Like it's getting to the point where I see every neighbor's in interview is first of all, he throws daniel jones under the bus consistently Um, he he in the interviews he was saying that he he's always wide open. So obviously that's throwing shade at daniel jones um He doesn't want to be there bro. He's annoyed. He's faster. I wouldn't be surprised if He instead of them trying to trade him. He demands a trade And I hope he does man. Yeah, get out new york, bro. You deserve Malik. I apologize. You deserve better I want the giants to be trash For the next 30 years because they they deserve this CEO. They they really deserve this They're a horrible franchise. I don't know if you watch barry mcconnor uh he's uh Football basketball contact curator. He calls the giants the floormariness of the nfl They win a fluke super bowl every year just like how the floor manners were in a fluke world series every year But they're not a real franchise They don't have consistency at all. Mommy you're I mean, yeah, you got a point Neighbors hates his qb so much. He called him Janiel jones Yeah, thanks They bow like see y'all, bro. This dude Anytime a receiver gets drafted even at the quarterback ships. Oh, I can't wait to play with the next and a third Uh, uh, Malik neighbors. Hey, uh, how do you feel about playing with uh, daniel jones? We'll see what happens We'll see what happens, right? Oh my god, yo, no, but it's like If I'm but here's the thing arger right? Why are you drafting a player that doesn't want to be there? That was my point like I don't care how good he is right if he if he doesn't want to be there then I'm not bringing him Playing like I can guarantee you if y'all if they drafted michael pennix that wouldn't have been the case Yeah, thanks Now they're gonna draft Carson beck when he was jackson dart some weird shit like that Yeah, and Malik neighbors is gonna be depressed all over and he's gonna have demand to trade they're gonna trade them And everyone's gonna get fired and then you're gonna they're gonna miss out on arch manning and then what's what's next for them? I don't know and see you like he's a why you also gotta realize he's a wide receiver Wide receivers usually kiss the ass of their whorebecks because that's who gets the big payday. He's saying fuck that shit Yeah Oh my god She lambs going off against uh rj cowboys trying to come back bro the cowboys ain't doing shit No, I mean cd lamb is uh Is uh rolls roice In uh in the hood right now. That's what he is. Yeah facts Uh speaking of that and I will say this right because you know, I admit certain things, right? You know what i'm saying because you know, I'll give you props rj because You're you're not so right on many takes so i'll give you props when you do get one correct. I don't know a lot of takes um Is micro person's playing uh I haven't seen him. I don't know. Hey can someone tell me if michael person's is playing Is if he's playing then i'm gonna give me a credit because Well that's gotta touch on Oh that that got a touchdown Yeah, it's 20 it's 30 to 24 if they make the p.a.t. Okay, and michael's not playing. Okay. Yeah, because I was about to say This name is a whole bum if he's playing well best abilities availability, so So that explains a lot if they had a mic and they would have been you know winning, right? Fuck out of here Mike ain't doing shit. That ain't doing shit Yeah, see he's carrying bro. See this is why dak has good numbers because see these literally carrying this fucking bum. Yeah, yeah, I mean Yeah, but the thing is Yeah, dak is just so this is where this is where dak's that pads. Yes Oh Yes, the ravens. Yeah, yeah, that is true. Yeah. Yeah, he did that bad. I mean CD bro, I don't know why he why he resigned he could have won somewhere else, but I guess I guess being a Guess uh being a dallas cowboy must be very appealing to some people right? That has died cute so I agree Uh terry listen cam ward and it's cam not can Uh cam ward might have potential might But he needs to sit if he goes to a dog shit team of the giant season start and be asked I'm sorry. Shador You know like I said, uh, Shador, you know I don't like his mindset. I'm gonna keep her eyes on like his mindset. No, he's too He's too, uh Um He's too rapper if that makes sense He's uh, he's uh, he's he's going through like the same thing like He wants to be a hood nigga, even though he's living in kohsak this whole fucking like you're not a hood nigga Stop being a hood nigga. Like first of all, it's not a compliment to be a hood nigga. That's one Yeah, like people are hood niggas because they were born in in poverty not because they wanted to be a hood nigga. That's one two um Why like all this like all riding up in a Rolls Royce flexing his Rolex after winning games like that's corny Do you like am I the only one who thinks that's corny? Yeah, by the way, uh, sure if you really do that to a hood nigga, you don't get you will get your shit snapped real clapped real quick fast and hurry so Speaking of that cam ward is not a dog. He should have like three losses on the season if it wasn't for the refs Uh kaiju, I think we said that kirk is better than dak so I mean Terry i'm not disagreeing with you But here's the thing cam ward, especially if he wins the heisman and goes to uh the national championship He's gonna go to a dog shit team. He's not built to go to a dog shit team All right. Well a terry terry Terry uh, where would you okay? So you say cam ward is a leak because he said cam ward is a leak, right? Yeah So where would you if he went into the league? Where would he fall within the quarterback rankings? And by the way, that's bullshit cam ward. See yo, I said it before I said again cam ward entered this draft This last draft He was going to get he wasn't projected to go in the third round. He was projected to go undrafted He came he went back to college because he knows this draft class is garbage Correct Like come on, man If he was that good like bone mix went uh top 15 jj McCarthy went top 10 Cam ward was so bad that he had to go back to college Listen terry if you like cam ward so much ditch jaylon hertson go drive cam ward Took a good look at that. No, I mean if you like him so much and he's a lee, right? I Shit Well, he's just getting like the miami team is good Like i'm not gonna deny that i'm on floor safe man. I hate miami, but they're a good team But cam ward i'm not like if you were like go to uh, I don't fucking if you were go to the cowboys and sit for a few years Under dad. That's a good circumstance. Yeah, that is I'll go I'll go with it Uh, yeah, definitely agree with that. I don't know. I mean I like cam wards and tangibles if that's what you mean, but I'm something. No, bro. When you have the best team. Oh my gosh, yo the fuck not as much old as shit Oh I know like who does You know who kind of he kind of reminds me of a little bit Oh Zach Wilson Oh cam ward That's that's You know the chat's about to go crazy on you, bro. What? No, I mean, can you see it the origin? He's a little better than zach. I mean i'm talking about college jack I don't I never was high on zach. I mean, you're not really high on cam I mean I mean listen, i'm not high on cam Well, it's not disrespectful. It's not disrespect. It's what i'm seeing is similarities to zach wilson. All right, that's what i'm seeing All right, I mean I mean, shit, they honestly if zach wilson was coming out of the draft this draft you probably would have went one over one overall Cam more is more like uh I don't know what comp I would give him Maybe you know what cam he's doing haskins That's his that r.p. Dwayne, but he's doing haskins on a good team carrying him But when he comes to the NFL he's not gonna show anything I mean, I mean at least his I don't know I feel like he's I could see that but And i'm not saying listen because I think he's comparable to zach but that doesn't mean he'll be zach wilson But if I had a bet he's probably gonna be zach wilson Oh, oh, tell me you say cam board is the worst version of jaden daniels. Why the fuck would you want him? Where's the worst version of jaden daniels? I mean I mean, I don't know. I mean Oh This is what I wanted to say Cam world was nice at washington state world was doing everything he can know he wasn't Washington state sucked and listen I seen lamar jackson take a shitty as louisville team and bringing the national championships That's how good you could be as a quarterback cam world was not doing that All right, let me let me look up The the quarterbacks right coming out. Yeah And because I'm gonna go on NFL draft plus it's a website where they compare all the draft profiles and how they're similar to To to core backs and leave so i'ma look up. Let me pull that up right here. All right first i'ma do shador Yeah, shador is a mobile pocketbasket. Yep, and his three closest comps, right? In terms of and they use the statistics by comparing scouting reports and all that bullshit number one At 87 percent they said he has he's very he has similarities to Let me guess russ No No, they do it to the most recent draft like people who just came out not like older players So they said he has similarities to michael pennick jr Um He has similarities to bone X Not bad. I mean he if you went out, I mean I would he's around that level, right? If you if you had a guess. Yeah, not bad All right, let's look up cam board yep All right prospect ranking cam board cam board. Let's see his three similarity levels They said 81 percent matching to jj mccarthy That's about right j j mccarthy. All right, so terry are you high on jj mccarthy? And that's he's a mobile jj mccarthy That's not a good thing I know we didn't see I know listen. I know we we don't know what jj is right. Yeah But I just don't like that That is a whole level Sucks Yo, he's playing like what people thought he was gonna play coming out of as the fourth round pick Yeah, basically Okay, so terry said yeah, he likes jj because the vikings have a perfect situation Terry you might sorry, you're not as bad as yaw, but you're getting through that third word By the way, is yaw the bad boy or like bad guy remember that guy He used to come in here and like clown on us um The bad guy remember like we did a review of this channel and he was like hyping up train lands and jimmy g Is that him? He's changed his name That could be Because he has horrible shit quarterback takes so It could be that would make sense You know so Is it would make you know, oh my god, it says karsten beck has similarities to will lovers. That's horrible No flag all right, so cowboys go for now Oh, they go for now. Oh Yeah, they lost Which is fun because I love seeing you know Oh, man that I've seen that dick writers Uh getting That's p that is p. I'm not gonna cat, but I mean Oh, well all this what happened all the jail in mill row hypo it seemed to have died down Because alabama sucks Grand they still might have a chance to be texas was still I just I just look at the the similarity levels that they show for jail in their world. It's hilarious Anthony rich has to be in there. It's in No, it's not even that good Is it jaylon, uh, milton? No It's jaren hall Whole and clayton toon awesome Let's ask the cause expert here. I don't even know who those guys are clayton toon, bro. That's uh, arizona's backup quarterback You know, we'll see we'll see how that is going jaylon. All right, terry at least you're not completely returning Yeah, jaylon's horrible. Like I don't like like I just I don't see it. RJ. I think he sucks He's not good I'm never like jaylon So, I mean, you know, this quarterback class so it's a dick. I don't want a cat, bro Yeah, it does. I don't like any quarterback coming out of this draft class. Like I know some people are climbing I mean dylan gaverill. I don't like him He's he's the eighth ranked prospect Like where's he coming out like the fourth round? Oh, I don't know organ makes it deep in the playoffs. He might come so he might he's first Bro, look, look these are his most comparables right there comparison levels uh 75 spencer rattler 75 75 stetson bened It's This that's about right. Listen, don't don't let it be fooled. This organ team is stacked dylan gaverill I watched him in oklahoma. No intangibles talented You know, and I I was gonna say he's more his highest ceiling is bold mix But if you're highest ceiling is bold mix, no Yo, this Yeah, I was the SEC is a tough conference. Holy shit. No shit. Kaiju. Didn't I say that? Then I tell you the fat fucks that it was gonna be a hard division now listen as an oklahoma fan I'm not shocked But you guys are like shocked that texas again their door is blowing off my fucking georgia the fuck Shout out to georgia, bro And by the way, did you guys only beat vanderboe by like three points? Yeah, they suck bro. They're not that good Yo queen bro, uh, I'm not queen. What's his ass? His name? Uh archmaning leave leave Georgia's texas is a down climbing team. You know, I'm saying leave bro. Come to the state. All right Wait, who? Archmaning. Oh, yeah, thanks Like this because texas ain't it bro. How the hell do you almost lose the vanderboe and choke to vanderboe? But see what's your thoughts on college football, you know, you watching a lot of the college football um What's your thoughts on it? I mean it I can't rule like I like it, right? Yeah, I like hate watching people like Kaiju and you know awesome kid I can't like it's not like it's fun for me But I can't really I'm like, oh, yeah, I have a team because fsu sucks nuts Like one in seven or something. Yeah Um, so it's like you have no one really to root for so kind of sucks in that aspect Let's see. Oh, this is the build up bro. It's the build up I was about to fucking say some shit before, uh Damn, oh yeah, by the way, Cowboys lost Good. They suck. I'm good. They deserve it. Yo Bro, but you know what that is gonna have like 300 yards passing 125 it's gonna be from uh cd Like it's incredible no matter how bad the Niners are because they they're not good this year Yeah, they still look on they still look on the Cowboys and they still clown the Cowboys and all that shit Like if you're a cowboy, how can you take so much disrespect? Like I don't get it I mean, what do you think is worse or the this the the the giants getting looked on the Cowboys this bad or the Niners getting Whooped on the uh whooping on the Cowboys this bad Where the drawings getting whooped what So like what's more like who owns who more Cowboys on the Giants more but 49ers own the Cowboys more Yeah, I'm gonna probably have I probably have to go Cowboys owning the Giants Well, yeah, that is divisional. Yeah Hey Nah, bro, I'm you first of all both these teams suck. Yeah, I agree We sort of go master J But I don't get like I don't get that mentality It's like you love the Cowboys and then you hopped on to the their rival that makes no sense to me I guess technically not the rival does not in the same division but at the same time like why Why would you hop on to why would you our conference? Yeah, but why you have the Niners are on the decline too? I mean, it's just like you went from like it's just I don't know. I don't get it like if that's like I'm not saying it's comparable in talent level, but that's just like me hopping on to Like the Titans, but what's the point? Yeah Like they're right like the Titans and Ravens are rivals, but not really but they're rivals Like I just I don't get it Are you hopping on like, uh, I don't know You know the Titans, yeah, that's probably a good comparison Like why like why and by the way master J. You're always gonna be a Cowboys fin, okay That is my favorite garbage time quarterback because I have CDF as you fuck you Brandon. Yeah, 50 bucks bum You owe me 100 too. John should finish your fourth What did I tell you Brandon you fucking bum? I told you we're gonna fucking obliterate you and you kept laughing talking about Oh championship teams don't win on on opening day. Well, yeah, good luck with that figure Yeah, yeah Brandon didn't pop on the pot this week. You know he can handle a smoke. He has an excuse this week. He's hopping on next week talk a little basketball and stuff like that, but in probably world series, but you know He he did have an excuse I guess his wife has one of her friends over and they're gonna be doing girly stuff and having a lot of noise in the background so You know either that or he or you know, Brandon's gonna have to fix some sandwiches and shit So uh speaking of that, uh, Brandon was right He did have the Patriots beating the Jets and he had like the Cardinals beating uh the Dolphins So maybe he's right. Maybe the Giants will beat the Steelers tomorrow. See yo That's his prediction. There's this retarded I think he did pick uh the Giants Brandon. Did you pick the Giants against the Steelers's money? I To be fair shot the leather leather off the ball and A team of 10 Wimby's wasn't blocking them. I picked this. Oh you picked the Steelers. I thought you picked the Giants I'm on. I ain't nobody picking on Giants. Well I even brand is picking Giants. I don't remember Hmm Well, Brandon will be on the um for the sports podcast this next uh sunday talk more next basketball Celtics, uh basketball, you know what I'm saying Uh, I mean, what one basketball season see you? I mean, yeah, I prefer can't wait till the I'm more excited like after the all-star game for the NBA Yeah Like at the beginning it's kind of like I This is my last year watching nfl until roger gadell uh resigns. Well, good luck with that Then he just sounded like a 10 year contract Over years ago Oh, yeah, sure. This is my last year watching the nfl until gadell resigns. That's a very odd statement to make uh I feel like that came out of nowhere Well, brennan's been like you guys think i'm disgusted with football brennan's been beyond disgusted with football Yeah, but I feel like your disgust Is more towards the product where his brand is just salty that his john's suck nuts Not that he's done with the product too, like you know the product sucks I mean even ceo, you can kind of see it like the product is beyond horrible I mean, it's not what it used to be. Yeah, that's for sure See it's dog shit, bro. It's like it's like watching It's like comparing old wwe to now Yeah, it's dog shit Like let's see the simple fact that you can see here and say like and you like football as a sport more than basketball and baseball But you even had to admit wow when I watch the basketball And when I watch baseball It's more like the product itself is way more better than football It's like I mean, it's a cleaner product. Yeah It's about time It's not about the giants trust me. I watched worst giants team and still enjoyed the product still Yeah, as a fact. I don't know. I don't know if he watched the worst giant teams He's not that old Like I heard the worst giants period was like in the uh Like in the 90s or 80s or something like that No, they weren't too bold back then Around like when Eli got paid after saying super old giants seem fucking suck I mean, but as bad as this I don't think so Yeah, quick question. What do you think about do you go into T a T Tvm? I really don't care What is that mature? Yeah, it's matters. I mean, I really don't care. I mean, it must be hurting for money What are going to Netflix so I watched the old highlights of the sports Uh, then the the current new one because I can see the memories that I love the best and plays out. Yeah, I mean Yes, yes, yeah, there's nothing like there's nothing like Football like in 2000 fucking nine Yeah, like 2009 football bro Like that was some good football right there How are you like 2015 was better than this horseshit? Yeah, but I can remember like the like Shit, it's like I remember as a kid watching, you know, Joe Flacco or a Lewis and all them Like overachieved because at the time, you know, they were always underdogs rightfully so because flacco was pretty bad Um, but it was kind of like you it was just like it had a different feel to it. You know what I'm saying, RJ I had like uh, it's like, yeah, bro. Like it's like oh, it's like right now. It's like all the game is on Yeah, okay, but before it was like It was like it was a whole big deal. You feel me? Yeah I don't know if it's because we're kids and we were more excited about that kind of shit, but No, because even like when I was in high school like the product even like back then like they were changing the product It was way better back then than now Baseball and basketball had been better than the NFL product product wise and ever since Then I really started watching UFC a few years ago. It took me away from football. I can definitely I mean, I don't know UFC, but If I agree with Brandon on that like in terms of UFC I get that same feeling now that usually is like when I know two good fighters are about to fight Yeah, you had to have a good card. Yeah, you hit when you have a when you have like a really good card You're like, oh, yeah, buddy. Like but now if with football it's kind of like like the Cowboys and Niners Is supposed to be like two premier franchises, right? Yeah, and it just doesn't I don't really feel anything I Cautious football is also better than yeah on the on the field. Yes college football is there's more of like I Like bro last year I was having so much fun with Florida State Like you must have a nice Yeah, bro, like even Oklahoma the beginning of this year. I loved it the defense my gosh Like half those hits Oklahoma does they'll get they'll get arrested in the NFL for that shit. Yeah, that is true No, not the NBA product the NBA product is awful Here's the thing about that. Do I think the NBA listen is the mid-range game dead in the NBA? Yes, but at least with the NBA like you know what taking away hits is in the NFL That's like taking away jump shooting in the NBA Yeah, yeah Yeah, when you think of basketball you think of shooting Like when you think of football you let's be for real see you I know it's humane and toss going masculine You think of hitting now that they eliminated that what do you think you think of great runs great catches Who gives a shit? Hey, listen, I mean you yeah, it ran into our UFC product is amazing overall even in their down times our marketing sucks So yeah, I will say that like the product like UFC if you really wanted to You can get into any fight if you really wanted to but yeah, it's like it's it's really good I I wish the UFC was a more main. I mean it's getting more mainstream, but I wish it was more mainstream than there's Yeah, so I mean, but yes, I will agree. UFC is better than uh the NFL I mean, is there any product that the NFL is better than or jay? The W NBA Come on, bro. Be serious in no way Um, then see see if you're just talking about on the field like I would rather watch baseball basketball UFC boxing You know what CEO I know I know I see are you sitting down because you might think As long as it's not women's sports then we should know I rather much watch hockey and soccer Oh Then the NFL that's how bad the NFL product is come on bro soccer in no way See, oh listen listen I I hate soccer but my friends who kind of like soccer They bring up a good point soccer has been the same for the last like 50 years There's no rule changes if you honestly if I can sit down and watch soccer and maybe get into it I might I might be able to get into it Like the see like you see you can't like bro. See You can't keep change your product every year and then cut off the root of your product I mean, hey, yo, and well grim mouth scott says w cat I'm so the NFL product this sucks. All right. Anybody here prefer soccer over football I'll park from RJ, you know obviously not because I watch the world cup most of the times when it comes and don't care about regular season fly after RJ you are over Oh, yeah, well listen because you Guys guys listen. I hate soccer. I hate soccer But at the same time listen, bro The NFL product is dead. There's no roots to it A world cup and Copa cup was better than the NFL product. I can't lie I mean, well Brandon is officially just Certified NFL here at this point I don't bro. Did you see like you? I mean listen, I I I believe you are jake is Like I know where you're coming from but when when brandy says I just feel like it's because the johns suck if they were good He wouldn't be saying this should sorry Yeah, boy at the same time. It's like This product is so bad It's It's so bad. I will admit. I'm kind of depressed that you know Florida states sucks, but boy's east state in Ohio state. I was out of I was on the edge of my seat hell boy's east state versus uh Oregon on the edge of my seat Texas and Georgia was a blowout, but I loved every single second of it, right Like I mean come on man. It's the same seal. It's the same thing. It's football. It's football. It's the same thing Uh, how'd you want to see the answers question? Uh Random question my dad thinks jerry jones is gonna hire niggas saving p caro bill bellichick. What's the question? Yeah, that's true. There is no question statement Okay, I mean if you're asking us is that a good idea? No because nick saving was horrible in the nfl p caro I don't think he's leaving seattle, but p caro's kind of peaked himself and bill bellichick is overrated means the old Expounding upon that on multiple occasions. I mean It bill bell check, you know would uh become you know, I'd I'd I'd be cool with you know bill bell check As the dc Author he says the head coaches the rave you're wilding. No as the dc. He'd be nice Listen bill bell check sucks. Okay, uh Listen and you know shout to fisk for bringing this up because uh bill bell check was taking a shit over the giants for uh letting say one barclay go bill you were the you were The man who let everybody go Like come on man, like you can't criticize the giants for doing something that you did get rid of them early Like you the fuck out of here, bro Like I like I can understand why tom brady fucking hates bell check because like bro I gave away like millions at top of millions of dollars just for you to give me west walker and julian fucking edam and chris holgan shit Yeah, like brady probably said his fucking bank account like damn this should be like a hundred more million dollars in here But I let this asshole give me fucking daniem dole A fucking quarterback that was playing in college that he turned into a slot receiver NFL production says i'm confused when you talk about When you're talking about products or you're talking about big hits or scoring I'm talking NFL productions, right? Yeah, obviously scoring is part of the NFL But the NFL at its peak in the early 2000s late 90s had a balance of it. You had you I'm gonna put it right When you all right, so you had offensive teams back in the 80s 90s and 2000s like the Niners the the pay man in colts the 07 patriots the great shawnt turf But then you also had your defensive teams like the ravens the Steelers the bingles who are gonna You know great you down and then you had like the middle of the pack teams like the packers who had good offense good defense With brett farver or reggie wane and today's NFL. There's none of that shit It's just overpaid quarterbacks giving a shitty ass products that defense can't touch them And the referee's bailing out the offense so we can see more offense There's no diversity in this game zero zilch It's literally just all offense and the offense is beyond dog shit and no defense Oh, brandish says Rural changes and overly forced storylines in the NFL Is the NFL's biggest problem as far as the field? I don't see how storylines affect on the field product on the field Product that's just like Like well, that's just drama. That's like NFL. But that's normal. I mean you get that in every sport Yeah, and NFL product says there's still defensive teams. There's no defense. Name me one defensive team And i'm gonna keep it real with the CEO. I don't think there are defensive teams in the NFL I think the NFL product's so bad and these offenses and these quarterbacks are so bad that there's little scoring games Steelers, how about that? Like I said, I just think the quarterbacks are bad in that, you know The product just sucks I mean, but it says I don't I don't know Brandon, can you elaborate on the whole story lines out? How is how are four stories? If Colin If Colin Cowherd says something on a show and it's a stupid take I don't see how that's running on the field product Just look at the defensive teams The Jets used to be there. They suck the Bears The Bears, I mean, they don't suck but they're mid in their rebuilding team Ravens suck Yeah, I came with the Ravens used to be good. Now they suck Uh bills, I mean they play dog shit teams the Cowboys suck the Niners suck Just let just less but but hits I don't get where you're coming from. I'm in my opinion Because notice, uh NFL production. How are you? I'm not trying to like the little bro. You but how are you bro? How do you come from? opinion just well Yeah, that would make sense because if you guys have considerable age gaps, that would make a lot of sense Yeah Because I can I would assume that someone like I don't know a little spongy probably doesn't understand where you're coming from. Yeah Okay, okay, okay, okay those okay, okay, uh, NFL productions How so he's 17 how what's how much seal how old will he be to even remember the no flies on the legion of boom? Um What do you mean? We like six years old, right? Yeah, he'd be a kid like a kid kid. Yeah, bro It means you can contest this we watched it in our we watched it at the time And even at that time people were saying the NFL was getting soft if the legion of boom or the no flies Don't was around all those guys would be arrested for what hits they did back in the day Bro he was I'm assuming he was born like around 2007 Meaning right RJ. Yeah That the era that I said was great Like like 2009 It was two years old Like like a fucking hell the rate like even like great Lewis and Henry in their washed up days that 2013 team Would be arrested in this era and that was literally 10 years ago Yeah The nine or CEO with Alden Smith and Dante went like bro. This was literally just a decade ago NFL productions You don't understand how bad the product has fold off within just a 10 year stretch and keep in mind NFL productions Back then the game was Soft to older people now. I don't even know if you call it. So this is just this this is literally just flag football with helmets RJ remember like back in that era like the 2013s 2014s and I remember like uh back then like Even remember Vontes perfect. Oh, yeah, thanks like he would like even then like he was uh He was too aggressive even then can you imagine something like that that he couldn't even play he couldn't even step on the field Yeah, thanks. At least he had a job. He would like it flagged. But at least he had a job. Hell that 2018 Cowboys team with uh Vanderes and Jaylen Smith. They used to lay motherfuckers out And see this was 2018. So was it six years ago? Yeah, NFL productions. You don't like I get like you're 17. You're in high school Like I think you're I think fucking what's his name random editors like 1920 he's older than you Like the game is beyond horrible. There's like defensive teams Yeah, they're not defensive teams and I'm just keeping real with you. The defense is kind of getting bailed out by how horrible the offense is Like seal you would think with all these teams with like basically the NFL's telling defenses You can't play defense in the quarterbacks. I received everybody getting paid. You think this this should be arena football It's not even that's right Like my gosh My top defense all time number one still curtain Two legion of boom three doomsday defense. See you're your master. You're offensive shit Defense, I mean your defensive list is garbage. What's the doomsday defense? Doomsday defense, I don't know what the fuck that is That's a fact burning No, bro, if you the fact that you don't have the Ravens in your top five means it's garbage Yeah, you gotta put that 2000s Raven defense in there and that fucking 85 bills team too Oh, it's the doomsday defense the defense lineup of the dows Cowboys team during the 70s where I just start back Okay, uh, master j no one remembers that no one cares about that that Ravens team is better that 85 bears team is better master j, uh, you know since we're You know, we'll probably be on here for a little bit more. Uh, and I already have it up You can enjoy We almost did it people you get fake master j Yeah, I mean, I mean, I'm more I grew with you NFL productions and I can't call it unwatchable because I watch it Yeah, um, I think I'm more not optimistic, but I'm less Disgusted with the product and our gin branded I Like well, and let's see you you have to realize like once again NFL productions you start your 17 I'm trying to think when I started watching football was 11. I didn't really start on the scene until I was like 15 So going off of that you just started understanding football like what? 2021 So this is what you grew up on Yeah, I can call it like seal I think besides this cowboy in uh This cowboy is another game. I didn't watch I didn't sit down and watch any Like full time watching my full attention out on my phone. Yeah, I can't remember the last time I did that with the NFL game I can't remember that I mean even the jets and Titans the jets in uh, Patriots game I had no interest in watching that I looked up at the screen here and there Same thing with the bears and watched and I actually took a nap and even this game I'm paying attention to the stream and paying attention to that I don't know. I feel like I'm more in the middle. I'm not so much where NFL productions is there were Brandon is Uh, I'm more like because I'm older than you in Brandon So I know and I understand where you're coming from I don't know if I've just gotten used to the product Um, but I can you even said it like you'll be like, you know, you don't fuck it not like don't care about the game But you'll be like, uh, it's all right I mean, yeah, it says I like football, right? So I mean, yeah, it's not what it used to be but it's kind of like I don't know. Do I like it more than I don't know. It says I feel like maybe I like football more than you guys do That could be The NFL let's make like we're not so much. We're talking about the NFL specifically. I mean at this point it's It's anonymous with it because apart from the c cfb, right? Like there is no other relevant league There's no So, yeah, listen Yeah, there is no relevant league and and by the way getting rid of gondola. I just don't see I don't think that solves the answer Yeah, that is the fact that I will agree with that Uh What was about to say we still have good defenses, but less big hits which I can agree we need more big hits NFL productions know the respect we're like it's not about the Like the defense cannot play defense anymore Anytime a wide receiver falls, you know, there's gonna be a flag for passion interference Even if he trips on his own feet CEO, it's a it's pass interference I mean, here's the thing like his NFL is putting up positions as I've seen it right sometimes There's a penalty, right? Yeah Where it is a legit Pass interference Yeah, or it's a legit tug or something where you could see where the why they would call it The the referees don't call it. They'd let it pass and then the fans bitch about it So they bitch about no calls too. So they're in a position where I was like, all right, we make the call you bitch We don't make the call. You you don't I mean you still bitch Yeah, so I mean you have you can't have it both ways and you have fans have to decide whether You want every single call to be called or whether you're okay with the refs letting shit slide Yeah, fuck that if I'm the NFL like first of all if I'm the NFL I'm letting defense, you know play defense, but And that's another the NFL cares way too much about Like people who don't matter like I'm sorry fags and women don't watch football You shouldn't care about them watching and that whole and means you're in debunked this that whole narrative 50% of the NFL Viewers are women. That's bullshit absolute bullshit. Yeah, it's not true Horse shit my nigga horse shit And this uh, right, so y'all remember when players bowled the fuck out in the pro bowl. I'm be honest You I don't really care whether they bowled the fuck out in pro or not. Yeah, great I didn't really they should just get rid of the pro. Why this morning? Yeah, they should So it is what is there's a difference between like Brandon's like what 2021 there's a difference like we can tell the difference See Brandon's maturity and me and Cio's maturity and we're like at least three years older than him But y'all are just children. Okay I mean I'll see you Yeah, it is true. We're gonna know Even the NBA started letting players play defense a little bit too I'd be watching the nicks smack teams with uh with leap what led pipes and baseball bats for 20 48 minutes Yeah, that is a fact. Uh, like I hate silver. I think I hate silver Like business wise, but on the court at least he's I can I can't knock him for this at least he's trying It doesn't have to try it like at least he's trying. Okay. You can't win an MVP Unless you play 65 games Okay, if you like at least he's trying to get players to play Like What Roger g'dell he just doesn't give a fuck And then not only that you're sending all these guys off to the shitty turf sucks too by the way too There's too much flop of fouls uh in flopping and shit. I mean you can say the same thing about the nfl I mean, yeah, I mean he does make a good point about that the flopping sometimes can be very ridiculous I Baseball we're going Yeah, I mean, yeah, but yeah, because now the games are four or five hours That's all they really need to see yo. I mean shit I mean because now that now that a baseball game is about the same time as an nfl game Like it's a watchable product because I don't have to sit there for four to five hours watching the same game Yeah, it's it's an it's an amazing thing and the product besides that can you name me the last rule change in the mlb Yeah, I mean and by the way, I do like Also the the video games I kind of do like the show I it's probably better than fucking madden to be honest with you I might if you're if you're endorsing it. I might have to buy this game The mba product is much worse in my opinion I Think he's more of an like I can I can relate to the nfl productions because I'm more of an nf like a I'm more of a fan of the The football football than basketball, right? Yeah, like you like I don't think it's a superior sport Yeah, and because of that it's sometimes hard for people like nfl productions or me to like Like we'll excuse the air is a lot more than someone like let's say Let's say someone like taj who taj is more of a basketball fan than he is a football fan So, but behold, you said the mlb you I'm assuming you like football more than baseball And you said the product is better on baseball than football. It's the same thing No, it is better like here's the thing like Obviously, I don't like the sport of baseball more. Yes. Yes but I if I really wanted to right if I said, okay I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna get into the sport of baseball like I could I could stomach it like I could Like before it was like not any guy watching every I'm not I'm not watching a game For four to five hours every fucking day. That's not happen. Yeah so with football the model that football has in terms of Now they're kind of fucking it up with the the games, right? But before it was a game on sunday The games are on sunday. There's seven. There's 16 games every game fucking matters because there's only fucking 16 games Yeah, like I like it. You know what I'm saying like I feel like sports would benefit a lot more like basketball. It's like shit We all don't really tune into laughter fucking all star break. Let's be honest. Yeah, thanks like I feel like the the fact that the nfl has so much Like let's say the Celtics play the nicks in game one. All right They they blew his shit, but does that game really matter in the scheme of things? Yeah But in terms of nfl like every game matters, bro Like you lost maybe you you're playing your division rival the first game that matters towards the standings like it matters So that aspect of football I think is what Is what uh tracks a lot of people like I feel like the mba and nfl I mean the mba and the mlb needs to like find a perfect amount of games as to where people would be like Okay, I because I could watch a full season of football But I can't watch a full season of basketball, bro. I can't do it So many games I agree with that, but here's the thing though if basketball Say like they cut the season down to like God forbid they cut the season down to 17 game seal. I bet that first game to the last game You're watching every single Celtic game If they cut down Oh, if if they cut it down, yeah, oh, absolutely. It would be just as fun Like obviously you can't because of the the ways the nfl, you know, the sport is more physical than basketball, right? Yeah, you can't You can't make I mean you can't justify paying the basketball players the amount they get paid right now and only have them pay Let's say 17 games. You can't justify that. I will say this the nfl adding more games Really piss me off as well too But I mean if let's say this if the mba could cut it down to like 50 basketball games I think the product would improve Hell even 40 Or 40 can you imagine? Okay? Can you imagine if they had let's say 45 basketball games? Don't you think the the m the uh The mba would like be a lot more digestible like because I could Because every game would matter a lot more Yeah, in fact like if 40 is still big it'll still be bigger than the nfl but hell like The nicks and Celtics they play four times. So if you cut it down to 45, that's twice So those two games matter it wouldn't matter in the grand scheme of things Yeah, and at that point I feel like if you can add that type of urgency Then I feel like at that point then football really can't compete Yeah I mean it's possible. I highly doubt it because that they're losing a lot of money. Yeah, they're losing. Yeah, it's just I think I think it's like the purity like I like football as a sport more than basketball and baseball But i'm just talking about like from like the major league perspectives on the court product On the field product the nfl is just not up there to par No, it's not up there because it's not the sport that it used to be because of how physical it was right so Now here's uh, hear me out I think more than Than physicality, I think more than I feel like the biggest reason that nfl sucks Is because of betting and fantasy football I agree 100% I feel like now Do I think the league cares about player health and safety? Fuck no, absolutely not They care about Fantasy they care about the betting So why that's why they're watering down defense rj because you can't do fantasy With shit offense bro That's why they're favoring it often because all these fantasy leagues and all this shit is that's what's ruining the game in my opinion I'm I think that's a huge part of it too No physicality and now that the simple fact that now everybody has invested in that Oh, like people are so happy that that press got got, you know 300 yards passing because of the fantasy points. That's why they're watching and that's where I feel like, you know, that's why I don't know Is the nfl even fixable at this point because gambling is legal now And gambling's always leaning towards offense in every sport, but now in football It's like shit. Yeah, that's that's what I'm saying It's like look look at what what brand has said earlier on the same, right? Yeah. Oh Shit, I mean the cowboy suck ass, but I'm happy that dad gets garbage. I'm sad because I have cd on fantasy like Like fantasy is not good. I'm sorry the betting is horrible like now you see you can't go on you can't go on fox You can't go on es uh, espn on and you can't even go on independent channels rj Not even big networks now without getting some ad for draft kings vandal Uh, fucking bet us Like I mean, Jesus christ, it's everywhere now. It's like I don't want to bet Okay, like if you wanted it back then if you wanted to bet and that was your thing you can do it, but now it's more like It's it's forced upon you And and I feel like that and especially with all the money that's involved in the game now Like of course, so what if you have a big amla that comes to a fucking ref like we said before and offers them A good portion of money to fucking I don't know call holding on a team playing against the chiefs just some show like that Yep I mean that that's where the fucking bullshit starts to come in in my opinion I just I hate betting. I never bet on like the only bets we make are like between us No, but I'm not out here going to vegas or some shit and putting $5,000 on the fucking ravens and and stealers game, right like that's not I'm not doing that like That's what's killing the fucking sport in my opinion That's that's a big part of it Yeah, but like I said, I'm actually kind of optimistic about it What baseball doing its thing with the NBA doing its thing? That's gonna have to force the nfl if especially if it comes down on ratings and stuff, which I don't know when that will happen That's gonna force it to be better. They're gonna be okay. We have to put a better product out there Yeah, that is true if they started losing viewership and Yeah, I have a few that because at least it's men running it and men are more business savvy I know we're supposed to talk about this But like I shak was on the unapologetic Oh Yeah, and he was saying to her like listen if you want to make the wm mba better You gotta load the rims to have the woman dunk and she was upset about that. It's like well, what you're doing now is not working No, no, I mean it's not but why would they be upset about it? I mean, that's not like That's like saying I know that's like saying um I'm trying to think that that's like saying oh like You should make women's clothes smaller so they can fit their body Yeah, no shit Like you know how women are they're just you know, you most well it was to see oh you shouldn't be saying that because we're gonna have a woman president So master j and kaiju because they like violence less see you I mean kaiju is retarded bro. I'm sorry yo guys You know nothing will be funnier Then when like CEO was going at kaiju's neck when he said women don't like violence I mean, it's that's just one of the dumbest That it's just bro. Don't get me on kaiju wearing bro Like kaiju there's a reason why not all women but majority of women like going out with the guys who abuse them and get out of jail for a woman literally have fantasies about And i'm not even joking like women literally have fantasies fantasies about sleeping with with serial killers I mean kaiju bro, why do you think women like Like kaiju, why do you think like when a country takes over another country the woman goes to the country that won? Come on You know yes beliefs, you know, this is Those are stupid. Oh my god, kaiju Those are I agree. Yeah, they're stupid. But I mean that's this is the fact And you know kaiju that's very sexist for you to call women stupid Right and you are calling bitches too Hey, that's very misogynistic kaiju. It's 2024 I Jesus kaiju, bro. I swear to god sometimes I swore if he's like related to michael in some way I don't know. I don't I don't I don't hate I will say this about michael. I don't think michael's ever complained about women. So No michael's just dumb Who cares equal equality well kaiju, didn't you say women are equal to men? weren't you like You and ceo going on about this See arjun this is what i'm being about. Sorry. He said who cares equal Quality what the fuck does that even mean? I have no idea Like this is like that's what do you use text to speech or something is like half the statements you say kaiju Doesn't as in human sense what Kaiju even that you're wrong women and men are not equal I mean What what is he trying to say? Arjun because I don't understand. I'm assuming he's trying to say men and women are equal They can do the same things but we know for a fact that's not true. No, that's not true, but I mean In as in humans, I mean kaiju. Do you not know the differences between men and women? I mean, this is element humans should work together as unity. What does that have to do with anything my nick? Yeah, let's make it stupid. Well, I mean ceo. I'm not trying to See oh, don't we have a black that black girl that was like whoopee gober who can't even he she can't even Disquinguish what a biological woman is Like I'm not trying to say kaiju is dead, but it's like look at the society that we're having now Maybe i'm disconnected, but it feels like like this is elementary shit to me Like humans See you you got to think bro. We Me people like me and you we're the old guard You know i'm saying we're not We're dying out see Jesus I mean we talk about it all the time. There's no more fathers in the household not saying that for kaiju But there's no more fathers in the household mothers just send their children off to the school system And this is the product that we get that we have like a hundred genders You know men and women are equal men can get pregnant uh We can have biological men compete against women because they cut off their dicks The fact that that's even a discussion and even up for debate is so Lee this could so fundamentally disconnected from reality that sometimes i'm like am i just crazy at this point because Like this would have never been a conversation ever like 12 years ago. Like i mean see you Listen There is no boy and girls no more says kaiju That he's speaking facts. That's what they're teaching us all Yeah, man. Uh, this is it's a it's a philosophy. It's dangerous. It's stupid. That's like saying A red and blue are are the same color. That's just stupid They're probably gonna say that too Also My dad supports woman. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Okay. Wait the fuck I have a power in that First of all, no one said you didn't have a father the household. Yeah, I didn't see And my dad supports woman empowerment, which would make sense Nega's Want to be my badass profile picture. Yo, kaiju. Are you drunk? Hi you're doing some drugs. You're making no sense Yeah, you all over the place But I mean to like this goes beyond like it's This society. I mean see you're a history guy. I mean, this is just Babylon, bro They did the same shit then and they did the same shit now All right, then the empire's gonna fall eventually Like they all do man I don't know what your profile picture is. I think see you took a shit on it last uh stream.

They go on there Yeah, but that's Michael It's from Michael Come on for everything Uh shout out to Michael, but Mike bro if you're gonna do like I mean, I guess it's a hangout stream, but like You can't be silent when you're calling games, bro. Yeah, that's just horrible Like he sits there and it's like 10 minutes have passed. He hasn't said a word. I'm like, what's the point of streaming? But at least like me and ceo don't commentate every single play but we'll comment the big plays But at least we're talking about other stuff like we're talking about the games prior We're talking about basketball baseball and we're talking we're like entertaining the people You just sitting there with music It's like, I mean, come on, bro You know, Kaiju said he has no life It's just he sits there to like 20 minutes straight without saying anything I'm like, how do you what's the point of streaming if you're not gonna say anything?
