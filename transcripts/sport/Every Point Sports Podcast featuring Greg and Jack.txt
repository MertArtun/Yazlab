 Every Point Sports Podcast featuring Greg and Jack starts right now. Welcome in everyone to week eight in the NFL season. How are we feeling, Greg? Old gamer GK entertainment, huh? Doing well, doing well. How are you? How are you doing? I'm feeling good. You know, it's been a tough week. Not as tough as it's been for the Yankees, but it's been it's been a it's been a battle, right? We've been trying to battle baseball a little bit of NCA football yesterday. Penn State won that was nice. They actually feel kind of a decent cover. They cover like I won on them. So I was very happy with that. Yeah. And they feel like a real they feel like a real deal now, right? They went out to USC a couple weeks ago. So for all you knit me lions fans, maybe it's time to start getting excited because they feel like they could be maybe that team. I don't know. They're competing really tough. So fun stuff. Even I don't I don't know. I know they have to play one of the two teams, Michigan or Ohio State. I probably Ohio State this year, right? Yeah. They'll play in Michigan this year. They'll get it. Do you have Michigan? Yeah, but they'll get Michigan. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they should this year. They should. But I'm just saying, even though they're let's say they lose one of those games. It's 12 team playoff this year. Your season isn't over. That's true. That's true. And I mean, that in years past, you know, Penn State would be good, good, good. And then they'd run into that boss, Buzz Sawyer, their Michigan, Ohio State and have that one loss and their season was done this year. They don't have to worry about that. 12 team playoff. Get in anything could happen once you're in the dance. Yeah. And they're live this year, too. They're they're live team. So for you, Nittany, it's very good. Really fun. All right. So here's what I'd like to highlight before we get started today. Weird stuff happens in the Halloween window. And we in October 27th are in the Halloween window. We are definitely in it. Right, Greg? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. We are. It's scary, scary week. It is a scary week. Yes. It is a scary week. I want what I want you guys to do maybe is you can watch the NFL games, but hold your loved ones tight because this one is a scary week. Greg, give us our first game. Would you? Yeah, yes. Our first game. We got Tampa Bay and hold on one second here. Let me scroll down here. Now get to it. Yeah, take your time. We got Atlanta Falcons at Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Falcons are giving one and a half points over under is 46 and a half. Moneyline is negative 122 on the Falcons and plus 102 on the Buccaneers. My God, plus 102. Let me explain to you something about this, guys. This line opened because Tampa Bay's offense is on crutches. Yeah. Yeah, no Mike Evans. Godwin's out. White is white evens playing. Who? I mean, you know, they should call up Tim Tebow because that's what Baker Mayfield is going to have to do there in Tampa. Yeah. Okay. So it started, it opened just to give you guys an idea here. It opened at plus 170. And I understand that's a divisional game. I understand the Bucs are going to fight hard. When I started looking at lines, it moved to plus 140. Then it moved to plus 110. What do you have it at now, Greg? Plus 102. 102. Yeah. Yeah. 102. This is even money. Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty much what you're saying, even money. Even, so the Falcons on the road are even money with a Bucs team that has no Chris Godwin, no Mike Evans. And no running back. No running back. Yeah. I mean, Buckeer, he's serviceable. Well, let's face it. He's no, what's his name? Rashad White. Is that his name? How I, yeah. Yeah. You know, so I mean, he's serviceable, but I mean, come on. How much of a Falcons are healthy? How much other creams go colors worth? I know that's what we're wearing today. Look at the point. Here's the point where I'm trying to make. Okay. There's a lot of lines out there today. And we said it's scary and weird stuff happens. But the fact of the matter is that I believe, and I've looked at all of them, is that 90% of these lines today are mispriced. Remember we said last week we felt good about a lot of games. We felt good about some stuff. And we did. This week you're getting buzz sod. Absolutely horror movie. Right. And the theme in this show will be don't get Freddie Freeman. Don't get Freddie Kruger. That's what he is, baby, right? Boy, they picked that name pretty nice. The name is called Nightmare. Nightmare. Freddie Kruger, Freeman, Nightmares everywhere. But this is a show about picking games. So we will do our best for you. You mentioned really quickly you used the word mispriced. Tell everybody what you mean by mispriced. So for the people that's not sure what you mean there. Okay, so I understand that lines get bet up and bet down. How did this line for Tampa Bay get bet down 90 points? Right, because nothing's changed for them. Besides they're wearing creamsicle colored jerseys and they're at home. Yeah. You know, I mean, to be quite honest, this is a Tampa Bay team that rides high and low on emotion. And if I found out Evans and Godwin were gone, I know it's nose to the grindstone, but I think I'd have a couple of beers all week. I will. Jeez. All right. Well, we're at home, honey. You know, send the kids with their babysitter. Me and Worf's have to sit down. Yeah, I'm talking about Mayfield. Me and Worf's got to sit down and have a couple of beers and figure this out. Yeah. Okay. I'm just, and I don't know if that happened or not, but the mispricing is the idea of a team being worth a certain point. A certain point value and then shaving you by 50 to 70 points. And it's every word of that. So I'm going to mention that time and time and time again, because it's your money, it's not theirs. Exactly. Exactly. And I got a little theory on this now. Okay. All right. You used the perfect word, misprice this week. When your bets don't work out to where you can make money, you can't do it. You cannot do it. So my theory here is in the last 20 years, they're the first five weeks of this year's football season. It has been the worst betting time for the public. So all the teams that the public has been on has been losers. The worst, the worst, the worst in the last 20 years. So nobody has won money. Nobody except for Vegas has won money due to first five weeks. Oh, guys, two weeks. Last two weeks now, the public has cleaned up almost every game has hit for the last two weeks. So the public has cleaned up, cleaned up Vegas the last two weeks. All your sports books, everybody has taken losses except for the public. So my theory is since Vegas sports books has taken a huge loss these last two weeks, let's recoup some of our money back this week. Well, you know, we'll throw them a bone or two. We'll give them back to them next week, but this week we need to make some of our money back. Yeah. I, you know what? So you and I work separately. Great friends. We talk throughout the week, but we work on games separately. And the first thing when I came out with you is I went this, this the whole week is mispriced and you went, that's crazy that you even said that because, you know, we work separately. It's not like we come up with this idea together and we give it to you guys. We're not in a production room. No, guys, we do this raw. Like Jack and I have like a five minute talk before we hit live and we go live. We do this raw. What you hear, what you see is all live reactions. There's nothing's rehearsed. We don't talk about what we're going to do. We just do it. We let it roll. You know, and so Greg said, I still look up there right in Pennsylvania, Florida. So, you know, thing we know players, we know all the stuff. And I'm, I am telling you, I'm begging you to be careful this week. I'm begging you, like you don't want to be Cortez on a phone and 94 month on our fastball. Big you. Oh, the Ravens, the Browns, right? Mm hmm. Let's talk about that game next. OK, yeah, I got a little thought on this game by the way. Do you? I thought you might. I do. Yes, I do. All right. The Ravens are negative. They're giving seven and a half over and under is 44 and a half. Money lines negative. Three 60 Ravens Browns are plus two 85. Jack, do you like your Ravens here or seven and a half? That's a lot. What? What? Give me, I want the money line on the Browns again. Money line on the Browns is plus two 85. That's insane. Yeah, that's insane. That should be a plus 400 spot. Yeah. We are lagging. He says we should be good now. I know before we were lagging a little bit, we should be good to go. Course they're doing that to us bombs. Stream yard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Stream yard has really screwed us. So but we'll find the best we can. You guys. Yeah. Yeah. We're the best. Okay. So let me get back to that. That's my price. I got that game. Yeah. OK, I will. That games miss price too. The Browns haven't won anything. Now they've gone. Are they going to a better quarterback? I don't know. We lost a wide receiver. Jerry Judy, right? Like hasn't done anything all year. And you got the map plus two 75, you said. Is that the price on it? I was just able to bring it back up. It is that actually two 85. Yeah, two 85. That should be much higher for my dollar. It really should be Baltimore. Yeah. I'm just smashing everybody. And by the way, this is where you guys got to look at this too. Right. So it's plus two 85. And yet the points that you're getting keep getting shaved. This started off at a nine and a half point spread. I wrote it down this morning. I have it circled right now. Plus eight. I have plus eight circled, which means I like the eight points. By the way, now they're shaving you down to two 75 or they're shaving you down to two 75 and seven and a half. Seven and a half. Yeah. See what they're doing. Don't let them do this to you. Don't you dare let them do this is the perfect week. By the way, if you like a team, if you really like a game to live bet, hold your money on the side and wait for the markets to be right for you. I'm telling you, I will. I'm literally I'm going to when we finish this, I'm going to circle a couple of games and I'm going to look at them. But actually the game just went up to eight and a half. Yeah, well, that's what should be. Yeah, just jump to a point and the money line went up to plus one back down. That's okay. That's not hurt. Oh, I wanted that eight and a half so bad. That's fine. They can give me those liars. Yeah. I I definitely agree with you. You stay away from this. Me personally, I think I am going to be on the Browns. Yep. I have a feeling it's up back up to eight. I have a feeling James is going to backdoor cover this. I really I have you know, we listen, we always say, don't go about your gut feeling, go by the stats, go by this, go by that. This is just one of those games that with the numbers and my gut, everything to me is pointing that the Browns are going to cover. I just see James screwing them right at the end of the game to covering covering us. Can I ask you the worst? The what's the not the worst defense in the league, but what's the worst passing defense in the league? Oh, boy. Let me see here. I would have to say, it's pretty bad. Dallas is this pretty bad by by but by what you're saying, it's going to be one of these two teams. I know the Ravens doesn't have a really good pass defense either. So they're susceptible. I know Humphreys is pretty decent, but he commits a lot of penalties. So. So it's the Baltimore Ravens and it's not because they lack talent. It's because that defense lacks discipline. Okay, you lost Evans. That should have been pretty easy, right? Just double in book and Godwin. But what Mayfield did was make sure he didn't just throw to Godwin. And they scored the Buccaneers scored 21 points after losing Evans. How I'm going to tell you how the Baltimore Ravens in their schemes got confused a couple of times and he hit wide open players. Well, absolutely wide open players. Yes, they had some interceptions, but let's be honest, the one interception. That was a fantastic play by Humphrey and Humphreys been league for a little while. Even Baker alluded to he didn't, you know, he shouldn't have thrown that ball. Okay. James Winston has a live ball, ladies and gentlemen, that arm has been warming up for weeks. He's got, oh, but he doesn't have, he's been, he's going to play today with all the receivers he practices with. Exactly. That's with the Mari Cooper. He didn't practice with the number ones. Yeah. He practiced with the number twos. And if anybody remembers, James Winston, Winston, he is not afraid to sling it. He'll throw in a triple coverage. He's not afraid. He's a monster. I'll tell you what, Baltimore's coming off of what they beat Cincinnati and they beat Tampa. Yeah. It's going to be a trap game for them. This could very well be a trap. You can absolutely. I love betting Cleveland to win this game. I thought about taking the money line at plus 320. You really could make some money. I like the plus eight right now. I really do. My listen, I know, we just want to hurry up in place a bit. So I sat there and I went, I like the home team. I like the home team. I did that in every single game today. I like the home team. I like the home team. You guys could say it with me. I like the home team. I like the home. It's really good, right? And then when I got to this game, I went, I don't know if I like the home team because I'm the public. Yeah. Don't be the public bet the team that you know, or, you know, what, what, what team to take, what games take the most guts to put your money on line today? Put it on there. Go for it. And my thing with Winston is I know he's possibly be better with, I know he's 30 touchdown, 30 interception guy, but is this team better with a quarterback back there like that, a guy that will push it down the field instead of guy that's going to hold on to the ball and get sat, run around a little bit, won't even throw intermediate pass, dumps it off like that. He just was not, he didn't have that team looking good. What's the running joke about James Winston? Do you remember? Like he likes crabs. That's right. That's right. DeSean Watson hid behind closed doors and did all of his misdeeds. Right. James Winston walked right up to the line, stole crab legs and walked out right in front of your face. That dude's got. I'm just saying, by the way, there were donors there. They would have been, hey, James, do you want some crab legs? Here, have some crab legs. They're yours. Let's face it. He has nothing to lose. So why wouldn't he just go out and sling it? He has nothing to lose this game, except for possibly getting himself another contract next year. DeSean Watson. Is behind closed doors making ditty deals. He is. Oh, that's what he's doing. Right. James Winston steals your wife and girlfriend in front of you. Come over here. I'm James. Nice to meet you. I'm telling you. No, I, this feels like I just talked myself into it. Sometimes I could do this. I'm taking Cleveland. Okay. All right. I'm taking Cleveland with the points. I like, I'll even take it with the seven and a half, but I'm loving to eight. I wish I was on it more with the nine and a half. Got jack said it opened that. Oh, maybe we should talk about Baltimore a little bit. Get these lines down. Guys, I know they're listening. All right. Next on the docket, we got the, uh, oh, I could believe. I'm taking a look here. I'm going to take paper. I don't like those. I'm not going to bet that game, but I think the Bucks will win today. I'm not paying games on a price. Okay. I'm not full. So you think that they have still have enough on offense to give it to the Falcons. Here's what I'll, here's what I want to say. So the FALT, usually you split. Right. Usually in division split. Mm hmm. Okay. Tampa Bay looked fine after they lost Evans. They still scored 21 points, right? Scheme stayed the same. Baker looked comfortable. The wide receivers that were there were backups, didn't get a lot of work with their hands throughout the whole week, because obviously it's God one. It's Evans. Let me just talk through this, right? I believe that Tampa's scheme is better than Atlanta and let's not pretend like Atlanta played well last week because Seattle walked up to that ringside event and punched them right in the mouth. Mm hmm. I mean, the bell didn't even start. Oh, that's what happened. And Atlanta, they started looking around with, Hey, don't they know where the Falcon, they did not care? Mm hmm. And I do think there is a weak softness to the Falcons where, where is in Todd bowls could smile to your face and tell you you're benched. Mm hmm. He does. Hey, I mean, he filled through an interception three weeks ago and it was one of his first and he looked right at me. He goes, Do you think that was a good pass? That's like, keep that up. So yeah, I think Tampa evens the series with Atlanta. And I think they know it, which is why this game got mispriced like that. Okay. I know. But yeah, it's just one of those games that yeah, I'm baffled when I know the injuries on the box, how it's only that to begin with plus one and a half. But I'm going to tell you. So this is not in this. Let me talk you guys through this a little bit better, right? Liam Cohen, who's the offensive coordinator for, for the Tampa Buccaneers, this is not his first rodeo with Baker having no tools. Mm hmm. They were at the Rams together when it was Ben Scoronic and a bunch of UPS drivers. Mm hmm. Yet they still mustered, averaged a game 235 yards and two touchdowns. He knows how to get it. It's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be bucky Irving. It's going to be, I think you're going to see Rashad White, maybe not play a lot of running back snaps. Maybe he plays in slot a little bit. Right. I do think he's going to get some time on the field. Um, you know, you're going to have Sean Tucker, by the way, fantastic, um, walk on off of Syracuse, right? He's like a bowling. He's like, uh, Maurice Jones drew light. Okay. Bounces off the guys bowling ball ish, right? You're going to see more plays like that. You're going to see, um, you're going to see Cade, and, um, and Sterling Shepard, because Mayfield knows both of them very well. There's going to be choice routes over the middle. I think this scheme that Lee and Cohen and Baker Mayfield put together can survive losing tremendous talent. That's what I'm saying. All right. Okay. I get what you're saying. I get what you're saying. I, uh, I just, I'm staying away from that game. That just, uh, has sucker written all over it. Uh, next, we got the Tennessee Titans at the Detroit Lions. Uh, this is the largest spread of the week. Uh, Titans are getting 12, uh, over under 45. Uh, Tennessee is at plus 500 money line. Detroit's at negative 700 money line. So a lot of points, man. A lot of points. I'm going to make the, I'm going to build a bridge here, right? And the way I'm going to build a bridge is, is baseball. Okay. We're in the world series right now. Obviously everybody knows that's the two best teams in baseball. Otherwise they wouldn't be here. But when baseball gets real close to their trade deadline, this is the way you make money off baseball, the teams that have, or that are selling during the trade deadline, just bet against them because, because the organization doesn't believe that the players that they have starting are strong enough and they want to take a look at some prospects. Okay. And you know what that does the whole team, they just go, oh, well, we're on a losing team and it flates the balloon a little bit. And the bridge that I'm building is to the Tennessee Titans because I watched a Will Leviss interview and, and I understand he has looked bumpy in some spots this year, but they just sold his best receiver to Kansas city. And I know he's going to try and make the best of it, but he knows that they're sellers. There's no way the Titans will win today. And by the way, there's no way, but, but I'm just actually this just went up to 12 and a half now. Yeah. Well, because they're listening to us, baby. That's how I feel. I wouldn't, it's Detroit. You're getting no value. I don't think, listen, they're not even going to be televising this game in Detroit. It's unwatchable. Yeah. 12 and a half's a lot. Yeah. Definitely. I'm not touching the money line negative 700. You can't, I mean, that's can't make any money off. That's the best stash story I can give you there. It's, it's like baseball, right? So you guys just learned something about baseball. If you see teams selling their best assets, it's time to start betting against that team. So find them. Yeah. Yeah. Find them, right? You know, for, for argument's sake, let's say the White Sox were playing against the Marlins and the White Sox had a very, very bad season. We, but the Marlins were, I know, but let's say, I'm not, that's not a white socks, you know, the hypothetical part is let's say the Marlins got rid of four players a couple of days before they were playing. I think that's a great spot to bet the White Sox because you'll get value. And maybe, yes, maybe that would have been win 34. Oh, gotta be right. So that's the thing I'm thinking here. But I mean, Tennessee's a joke. I mean, they weren't very good when D half was there during that going to be they're even worse without himself. Yeah. I like the Titans here too. 12 and a half is a lot for any team, but I mean, Detroit's so good. Titans are so bad. I find it hard to believe they wouldn't cover here. I'm getting ready for Thanksgiving in Tennessee. That's what I'd be doing. All right. Next. Next. This is a trap game, I think, right here. This actually just went down a half a point while we were talking. Green Bay Packers at Jacksonville Jaguars. Who do you like? Or let me get let me get through here real quick. Negative three and a half. So Packers are giving three and a half over under is 49. Moneyline is a negative 192 Packers plus 166 Jags. If this was over in London, I'd like the Jags. London is like home field advantage for the Jags for some reason. They just keep it over. You know, but unfortunately, they're back at their real home in Jacksonville. And they're going to turn into the regular Jags that we have been seeing all year. So I love the Packers this game. I said this could be a trap game and it really could be Jags coming off of a nice win. Packers coming back from a nice win. They had I forget who they played last week. I know it was a tough. I remember it was a tough game for them. So I mean, this could be a trap game, but I do like the Jags. This game did go down a half a point while we were talking. Packers were at giving four. So they're giving three and a half now. I like it more at three and I do three and a half. So if it drops to three, be all over it. Other than that, I personally would like to. You know what I'm going to say. I would like to tease this game. Yeah. You know, and I want to tease this game with another game. That we will talk about later. So we'll put a pin in that. Put that up there for a tease for another team and we'll go over that on Jack. Who do you like here, Jack? Well, I mean, the Packers just beat the Texans. So I mean, that's who it was. That's who it was. The Texans. Yeah, that was a nice hard fought win by them. Good win. One last second field goal, correct? Yep. Yeah. So I mean, you know. So I mean, we don't even have to watch the Super Bowl this year, right? The Packers will be in it. And it'll be the Chiefs and it'll be, you know, love my homes, right? And state and commercials everywhere. And except, you know, teams really get up these alternate jerseys. And I don't think it's so much the teams. I think it's, you know, the owners are like, hey, it's alternate Jersey day. A lot of the games are at home. I believe that these alternate jerseys are like college football, homecoming or whiteout games. Okay. Okay. Does that make any sense to anybody? Whiteout games. What they do is they kind of proof a game for the team to win. That's what they do. You know, so regardless of the team coming in there, you know, and I understand that there's, you know, all these games aren't fixed. Fine. That's fine. You could, you can eat those bag of chips, but I'm going to tell you right now, as things progress, officials get moved into different games for different teams. Isn't that correct, Greg? Oh, absolutely. You always hear about, about rest being moved from here to here. Uh, one ref doesn't perform a certain way in this game. So they're being moved off the next game to be replaced by another ref. All the time. And if you guys don't believe in that, I just want you to go talk to Sam Darn about that safety face mask. That's what I'd like you to do. Because that was a home game for the Rams. And by the way, when Minnesota started competing, the flag started flying. I mean, oh yeah. Yeah. I haven't seen that much laundry in a laundromat on a Sunday. Okay. And it's because they were at home against the Rams. And I know some of you guys don't like to subscribe to that, but it's actually true. Okay. Yeah. With that being said, Green Bay wore their alternate jerseys last week. Mm hmm. And teams coming off an alternate jersey win have a losing record. Oh, no, I did not. I like that stat. Okay. They have a losing record, right? Because everything that was put into them being able to sell that jersey to fans was put in that Houston was never going to win that game. By the way, Houston had alternate jersey, uh, night the week before did they win? Yeah, they did. And then they lost. Ah, see what we're doing here. It's very important to know this. So I will take the Jacksonville Jaguars at home on the money line because I think the Jaguars win this game by like two late game field goal, whatever something happens, I'm just saying, 55 million dollars didn't get spent in Jacksonville. Right. For them not to go anywhere and to build a stadium in two years, get lost. Give me the Jacksonville Jaguars. How do you like that? All right. No, I like it. I like it. And like I said, this very, very well could end up being a trap game for, uh, for, um, Green Bay. Um, but I mean, all, all, all my logic points to Green Bay, all your points make sense. So, uh, our viewers have to, uh, they have to, uh, decide who they're going to go with. Uh, you or me. So yeah. Next week, guys, I want you to put in the comments. Let us know who you went with with this game. Um, I definitely be taking the Packers this game. Like I said, I, I do like this game. I do like the Packers here, but I could see very easily how this could be a trap game and the Jags could walk up. They could walk away with the win. I mean, Jack, some valid, valid points here. Yeah. Those Packers feel like a 94 mile an hour fastball. Yeah. I mean, they're playing great ball. They're playing like one of the best team, like the best team in NFC, not one of the best teams, the best team in NFC. Yeah. Public owned, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. Is it a week to destroy the public? It is. It is. It is. Baby. All right. Here we go. Now to this game. Oh, this game. Yeah. Philadelphia Eagles at the Cincinnati Bengals. Eagles are getting two and a half over under 47 and a half. Eagles are at plus 120 moneyline. Bengals are at negative 142. A little bit about this game. Eagles have not scored the only team in the NFL to that have not scored in the first quarter. So Eagles have not. Cincinnati, as bad as you want to say their defense is, they don't give up the long plays. So just a little food of thought right there. Those two little stats. Because the Eagles do, they live off those long plays. They live off of them. Those long passes to AJ Brown, Devonte Smith, you know? So yeah. OK. You just changed my mind. Kind of. OK. So I believe in, I think a lot of this could be live betting and trying to get your spots, bet your spots this week, right? We talk all the time. So you just did it. Um, I don't love Cincinnati two and a half. I did all week and then I went, that's easy. That's easy. Everyone's going to be on that. Right. So I actually think that that line should switch to the opposite side. It should be Philly minus two and a half. This is the trick. Right. And you just said, I love that you said this because it was like, it was like a light coming down in my room. You just said Philly hasn't scored a first quarter touchdown. Mm-hmm. Here's what I want you guys to do. I want you to wait for Philly to score their first, first quarter touchdown. See how we did that? And then I want you to bet Cincinnati Bengals getting five and a half because that's what's going to happen. Isn't it Greg? Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Exactly what's going to happen. That's exactly what's going to happen. Cincinnati is going to get five and a half after Philly goes up seven, nothing. Right. You guys are going to get the value you deserve and the Bengals are going to lose by three. All your friends will be throwing their TVs in the streets while you're collecting at the I think that's the way you play this. Am I right? Yeah. I mean, I, I see it. Um, I, it's a tough game to pick. It's really, it's really tough points. You know, Oh, absolutely. Yeah. If I'm getting, if I'm getting five and a half with the Bengals, I'm taking it all day. I'm no T Higgins. No T Higgins. Oh, even still, you have Chase Brown. Uh, they still have their, uh, pretty good tight end. Um, who's actually pretty athletic. Uh, so yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. I mean, I, I do, I like them. I still like them. Uh, it's not a favorite. No, if they're getting five and a half. Yeah. No, I want points with them. I want points with them. Yeah. Like you said, it should be flip flop. Uh, I know, I know Vegas doesn't say that it is like this anymore. Back in the day when you bet, uh, the home team pretty much Vegas always just gave them a three points right there, right off the bat, your negative three. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Bengals are at home at two and a half negative. I'd say not the Vegas loves the Eagles. It is a little bit. Yeah. It's, you know, they're, they're, uh, you know, someone's telling you to jump in the water and Vegas is going, ah, just a toe. Just don't, don't jump in. Just, just put a toe in. Just a cold though. It looks bluer than it's supposed to be. I don't see any steam in that water. Yeah. I agree with you. Yeah. Yeah. Says Vegas all over this, uh, with the Eagles. Uh, if you guys want to bet with our, with our theory this week, you take the Eagles. If you want to bet smart, wait for the Eagles to go up by seven. Like Jack said, uh, hopefully they do get their first quarter touchdown go up by seven. It, the points flip flop on you. I think that's a great bet. I would love it. You know, and, and it was that statistic that you mentioned, that's why we do this guys and he just kind of floated it out there and went, what did you say? Mm hmm. Right. And it's sometimes, sometimes you'll hear it from us. Sometimes you'll hear it on TV, but that, what did you say moments? You go, Oh, I know now. And once you get that feeling in your gut, it's not breakfast that you need. It's the, it's the money from your bank count to bet on the game is what you need. And then, you know, you put it right back in your bank account and you get a bigger breakfast. There you go. Uh, all right. Next. So, uh, basically what we're saying is just wait on this game live. Bet it. Hold off. Hold off on your money. See what, see if, see if this goes the way that we said, said, doesn't, don't touch it. You didn't lose out on anything. You didn't lose your money. So therefore you're good. Just, just wait. What we're saying is just wait on this one. Next. Yeah. No, don't rush in. Don't jump in. Just put it down. There you go. Next. We got the Colts over Houston, Texas. All right. Well, yeah, over in theapolis Colts at Houston, Texas. Colts are at plus five over under is 45 Colts are at plus 185. Texans are at negative 225. You just did it again. What's that? You just did it again. Right. So in the Philly game, you mentioned a fantastic stat. And then now what you just did is, is by accident, you went Colts over to Texans and then you swan, then you went back to actually what it was. Yeah. That's because I was thinking I do like the Colts at plus five here. What's interesting is the Colts always play the Texans within three. Mm hmm. I was just, I was going to say they play them tough every single time, no matter who's under center, who's on the team. So, uh, yeah, I, I, I do, I like the Colts here. Yeah. I think Richardson looks better and better and better. I, you know, Houston's got a really good front line on defense, but they make mistakes in the secondary. And that's, I keep saying it, but it's really all he knows how to do. Richardson can't move defenses, but he can throw it 90 yards. Mm hmm. Alec Pierce, uh, one of the prop bets that's been really heavy today, right? On the, on the farm guys is Alec Pierce will catch a 25 yard pass. Alec Pierce is going to catch a bomb today. He catches bomb and, and again, that's what he's really good at. By the way, if he ever gets good at different kind of seven routes, intermediate routes, or if he ever gets a real full time quarterback there, which I'm not sure Richardson's going to be the guy, but for argument's sake, these are both first round draft picks going up against each other. And, and I, I like, yeah, give me Indy with the points. I, I, yeah. Okay. Uh, what was that game that I said I liked to tease with? Now, if you want the money line, was that the Green Bay game? Yeah. Yeah. All right. Green Bay. T, I like Green Bay. Hold on. I don't know. I, uh, drafting is just timed out on me. Oh, bring that back up. Right. Kings again. I know you could take Houston on the money line here, though. I think Houston's going to win this game. That, that's, that was my thing. I do like Houston this game, uh, but I like, uh, what I would like to do is do my teas. Here we go with, uh, Green Bay. Okay. Uh, and with, um, uh, Houston. So if anybody is new to this tease, you take two or more teams, two to three. I don't know if they allow any more than three teams. Uh, but you take, uh, at least two teams for the game starts. Uh, if a game starts, you can't tease. Uh, and then you get six points to your favor. So if I'm taking Houston, I would be getting a plus one point to my favor. And if you already think Houston is going to win, that's right there. It's gold. And then, uh, Green Bay, I'd like to remember, I said I like Green Bay, but I like them more at three than I do three and a half. Well, I'll be getting two and a half here instead of giving three. I'll be getting two and a half. Love it. Love it. That's what I will be doing. I'll be take, I'll be teasing Green Bay and, uh, and, uh, detections. What I say, I like Jacksonville by, I said, I like Jacksonville by two. Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. What that, and if you guys, if you guys didn't want to touch that Green Bay game, because like you guys are like, I'm not sure the, the one team, the one team I was going to tease with, uh, detections was the, uh, Miami Dolphins game, but we'll get to that later on. So I just wanted to throw that in there. I had a couple of teases built into this Houston game. So my point is I really like Houston to win this game period since I already haven't built into two teases that I'm doing. So normally I wouldn't do that. Normally, that's not all negative 225. So you're not making too much off of that. You're making maybe half of your money. That's not bad. You know, so it's not bad. It feels like a lie though. What's that? The five still feels like a lie at a minus 225. Yeah. Yeah. That's, it's minus 175 bill in case you guys are wondering. All right. So for Indie scores, the first touchdown two, and then you can live bet that. So a 10, uh, $10, you're winning $4 and 44 cents on a $10 bet. So you're not even gaining half your money. So look what they have done to us. So you put $50 down, you win $7,222. So you're winning $22 and 22 cents. I like to tease personally. That's what I'll be doing. But anyways, we both like Houston in this game. Yeah. Absolutely. All right. Next game, we got the Jets at the Patriots. Jets are giving seven over and under 41. Jets are at negative 280, or sorry, 295, 98 on the money line. And Patriots at plus 240 on the money line. Seven's a lot. Seven's a lot for a division game. Yeah, it is. And the Patriots are quietly playing pretty good. Yeah. I mean, May's playing some good ball. You know, he's, uh, he's not making the stupid decisions. You'd see how deficient they are as a team talent wise. But like you said, they're playing competitive football. Uh, I still win Jets though. I don't like the Jets at seven though. No, no, no. Just so here's what you could do. Right. So you could take, uh, you could take the Jets on the money line. Look at guys, you're going to have to take chances today. I just, I don't, I don't mean to say that, but you're going to have to take chances. I mean, that's just the way it's going to be. I, I, I like the Jaguars a lot. I think you could take the two teams that have underperformed this year together. I think you could take the Jets and the Jaguars on the money line. I think you could. I think you could take the Jets. Yeah, you could take the Jets and then the Jaguars getting three and a half. I think the Jets, if the Jaguars lose today, the laundry will fly in their favor. The most they lose by is three. You know, they called Trevor Lawrence the prince and the golden child before he has done anything. There's a reason why folks, and I don't care that, and they don't care that Sam Darnold and all these other quarterbacks have quarterbacked better than him. It's not going to last very long. I don't know. So then you take the Jags with the points and take the Jets with the money line. Yeah, I love that because, because again, you know, Evan Ingram getting reincorporated into this offense has been big for Jacksonville. Mm hmm. I just, that's who I would put together and feel comfortable with. No, no, I'm kind of looking at it. Kind of like the over in that game too. 49. Jacksonville and Packers. I think a lot of points are going to be scored. 52-ish. I think it gets around there. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, not that I'm looking. I kind of like the over in that game. All right. So Jack just gave you a nice little parlay right there to do. I kind of like it. I really do. Yeah, yeah. Neither one of us like the Patriots in this game. Like I said, they're playing competitive football. Could they cover this game? Yeah, they could. I don't see it, but they could. That's why you just take the money line or tease it with another team. Get six points towards your favor. Yeah, yeah, we already, yeah, we already went over the actually, you know, What game? What game would go over? Oh, what about if you tease the Jets and the Buccaneers? The Jags and the Buccaneers? Yeah, no, no, the Jets and the Bucs. The Jets, you would be, you'd be giving one and the Buccaneers, you'd be getting seven and a half. Getting seven and a half. Yeah, the thing with that, though, it's you like, you said you like the box. So I know, but that game's either going to go the way I said, or they get absolutely smoked out of the building. Yeah. Like, like, I personally, this is what you do then take the, take the, take the Jets, tease it down to one and then the Dolphins tease that down to where you're getting to. Yeah, you could do that. That's the next game we're at, by the way. We're at Arizona Cardinals at Miami Dolphins. Cardinals are at plus four, over under 46 and a half. Money line. Cardinals are at plus 164. Dolphins are at negative 198. I love, love, love the Dolphins here. I said this last week how much I like the Dolphins. I like them more this week with Tua back. I briefly told you before why I like this team, why I like this game. But let me just reiterate it is that Tua's back. So therefore McDaniels and Tua are going to have to basically turn the page over the most disastrous month this team's had in a couple years. They've been the worst team in the NFL probably for the last month. I hasn't been able to do nothing. I think Mike McDaniels is going to pull out all the stops on this game with Tua back. Every bag of tricks that they have, their backs are against the wall. They don't win this game, they're done. So, yeah, I like all that. Obviously, I said weird stuff happens in the Halloween window. One of the most famous magicians ever, Harry Houdini, died on Halloween. People don't know that Harry Houdini used to have obviously he was a locksmith and he did magic and stuff like that. But in between road gigs, he was able to really, he was good at taking punches. So he used to let people punch him in the stomach for money. And what happened is he let a kid punch him three times on that day and pay him. And it ruptured something in his stomach. And he died on the road. And I mentioned Harry Houdini in this Halloween window because the greatest magician right now is coming back. Tua is not this magnificent talent. Right? He's not. But he runs the Mike McDaniel Magic the best. He's the magician that plays with the deck of cards best. Right? And now that he's back, you are going to see why it takes certain quarterbacks to run that rock party. He's not the most talented guy, but he's a good magician. Is a good magician. He gets the mechanics and he gets the machine working the best. It's the same offense. Exactly the same offense. And you almost want a guy to be a good magician, but he doesn't have to be. The greatest athlete is not going to make the magic look as good. So my one question here is A, I think that I think Tua, it's not a question statement. Tua is a better magician than Justin Herbert is a quarterback. Yeah. And Arizona, I'm saying that because because the Chargers had an opportunity to put Arizona away last week, Justin Herbert couldn't find five yards. I think he has a little bit. Just follow me because you got the same coach too. I think he's got a little bit of a Kaepernick problem. I know you guys hate him, but Kaepernick was good for 15 to 25 yards. Rocket dead on five yards. Good luck, pal. Can't figure it out. I can't figure out. I'm going over their heads, going into the ground. I remember all of it. Justin Herbert reminds me so much of him. Just there's no touch on the ball. Certain quarterbacks has just that touch. They might not have the strongest arm in the world or anything like that, but they just have touch on the ball. And sometimes that's all you need. You don't need that 95 mile an hour fastball. He threw it six yards past Palmer last week and all they needed was a couple yards and he hard-bought went nuts for a pass to Ference. The fact of the matter is the pass was embarrassing. Yeah. And so with all that information, that's where I'm leaning with you. The magician is back. And Arizona won last week. Yeah, and they haven't put together back-to-back good weeks all year. I mean, even back, they came and put together back-to-back good halves. One half they play good, the next half they don't let it know back-to-back game. Since the Arizona did win last week, and Miami's back is up against the Walls, like you said, two of the magician is back. Yeah, everything to me points that the Dolphins are going to win this. Coming off of a short week. Getting to Miami early because we want to get to Miami early, but the problem with getting to Miami early is those clubs are open late. I was just going to say there's a lot more to do. That's right, man. This is in Arizona where everybody goes to Applebee's and hangs out. No. Everyone's to Sean Watson in Miami. Exactly. All right. Next. All right. That's our one o'clock slate, guys. We're on to our four o'clock games. This game here, I think, is interesting. Buffalo Bills at Seattle Seahawks. Bills are at negative three over under 45. Bills are at negative 162. Moneyline Seattle's at plus 136. Moneyline. Everything points that the bill should run away with this. Don't understand why. But unfortunately, if anybody has watched the bills this year, they have beaten up on bad teams and barely squeaked high against good teams. It's been one quarterback. Josh Allen has not thrown a pick yet this year either. He has not thrown a pick. That's true. But there's only been one quarterback in the past 10 years to have a nine for 30 stat line. Now, is it Josh Allen or is it Geno Smith? Because most people just answered and said Geno Smith. And they'd be wrong. The answer is Josh Allen. Nine for 30. And they went out and found him a number one wide receiver after that because Stefan Diggs barked online and said, Josh does need a number one. And it's true. He doesn't make a number one. By the way, he hasn't thrown any interceptions because he hasn't taken any chances because there's no receivers that he believes to take a chance with. Now, I understand that he got a Mari Cooper, but the Seattle secondary is good. They're real. Yeah, they are. They're very good. I think the bets that you can make on this game are Josh Allen throws an interception. Okay. I think he thinks he has one on one with Keon Coleman. He does. He's over the top gets his first interception, but it's good news because he gets that one on the way. You know, sometimes it's just good to get one on your way. I think this game is real, real tight. Gino Smith's a good quarterback. I don't really want to touch this game. Yeah, I'm not touching it myself. I think, I think Seattle is going to get a strong dose of James Cook. Buffalo is smart because that's the one thing you can do against Seattle. You can run on them. Yeah, you know Seattle best and is Ed Oliver playing today? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. That could be a huge thing too because Walker could run all over, end up running all over that defense. It'll be embarrassing. I promise you. Yeah, I mean, Metcalfe had a great game last week. You know, I mean, there is no very well could be going to Seattle's way. It's in Seattle. You know, there is no Metcalfe this game. Oh, there is. Is it? No Metcalfe this week. All right. Well, I like Buffalo a little bit more than I think I like Buffalo a little bit more. So, so again, all things equaled Buffalo goes up to Seattle. It looks so impressive. But understand no Metcalfe when you guys make that bet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Again, I'm not touching this. This is a game. If I had to lean one way, I'd be leaning towards Buffalo. Yeah. Yeah. Metcalfe is a big, big, big missing piece for that offense. If Seattle. I want to say this too. After this week, you do not have to keep Jackson Smith, Nijigba on your fantasy team ever again. No. Oh, he's not a number one. No, he wasn't drafted to be a number one. But ESPN keeps lying to people and ranking his statistics high. He hasn't hit the benchmark once. Yeah. Yeah. Jackson Smith, Nijigba has the same projected points over the past couple weeks as George Pickens and George Pickens has had me with better legs throwing him the ball. I'm just saying that. Like, what are you guys crazy? Jackson Smith, Nijigba has never dominated a game once. No. Ever. No. What are we doing? Yeah. Yeah, I get it. I get it. I really looked at them too much because I was never, I never wanted to have a, I did myself. There was never, there was never a need to have them on my team. You know me. I just get furious sometimes. I get it. I get it. Hey, you can rent. You're here. You're here. Ramp. Ramp. We're all going to listen. It's a can't take it. I won't take it. All right. So neither one of us likes this game at all. We're both leaning towards Buffalo. It sounds like. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Next, we got the Saints as a Chargers. Saints are at plus seven over under is 41. Saints are at plus 260 money line. Chargers are at negative 325 money line. Thoughts here. This is one of those mispriced guys. It is. It really is. I look at, I know that this, the first of all, this is insane. Right. The Saints got blown out. The Chargers lost. The Chargers didn't look great in that loss. Let's not, they didn't, you know, a couple overthrows, couple flags, you know, I mean, they started shot to win that game. No, they shot a shot. They could have won that. No, I'm right. But, you know, the Saints got absolutely smashed in all facets of the game. Right. And so it's only minus seven because they don't think the Chargers can pull away from anybody. Yeah. And, but it's 350 or 325 now money line was 350 when I wrote it. I just like, it just feels like I'm not putting all my money on the line just to make a hundred bucks. I don't mind. I don't mind putting money out there, but this should be 265. Yeah. I'm barking right at the odds makers because they know I'm right. You know, there'll be somebody knocking at my door in 20 minutes all of a bullet in my head. I don't care because I told you guys the truth. Mm-hmm. Right. I can rest on my laurels head to my casket knowing that I told you guys that this should be a 265 and don't bet it. Let them keep their money. I'm so mad. I'm so mad. Another miss priced, misrepresented. Don't get Freddy Krueger Freeman. Don't get that. Don't throw a 94 mile an hour fastball that I'm still on that. Don't throw a 90 down the plate to a major league professional. These are major league professionals, by the way, major league Vegas line guys. They will take your money. They will have you living outside and getting divorced. Mm-hmm. That'll, that's what'll happen. Yeah. I'm just, I'm just, this is one of those games. Miss priced. Mm-hmm. Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, all the ones that are mispriced leave them. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't win. I don't like too many points here. This is a game that I would take the money line in a parlay somewhere. Yeah. That's about it. Yeah. That's about it. So we're both not touching this game. I'll take the chargers and the money line and parlay it with two other teams just to make up a parlay for myself today. You know what I'm going to do? Here's what I'm going to do. And, and again, live betting. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Live betting today. Okay. Have your convictions going in live bet today. I'm sorry. I'm giving so much advice today. Right. Have your convictions because I want them not to lose. Absolutely. I want you to, I want you to pick games that you really liked in the beginning of the day. And then I want you to see how that went. And then I want you to look at four 30 games and think if you were even close. Yeah. If you're having a day, you're having a day brother. But if you are not, like I'm just saying, like you can get absolutely wiped out here. Oh yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. A quick parlay that I like chargers, jets and Texans all money lines, three team parlay chargers, jets. Chargers, jets, Texans all money line. I love that bet. Yeah. Yeah. Parlay those three teams. There you go. I always, we always like to give you something guys. I do love something. You know, but yeah, that's one that I really liked that I'm going to be doing myself. So yeah, I really liked that one. Do you could, you can play that one. It just feels like today one's going to be, you're just going to play one too many. Yeah. And that's why I'm really limiting myself this week. Really limiting my, I mean, listen guys, I showed you my bets last week from the previous week. Yeah, you were ever, you like, I'm everywhere. I put so many bets out there. I, you guys are going to look at my bet sheet next week and be like, Holy shit, you were right. You, you barely bet this week. But where I am betting, that's where I'm going to, I'm betting strategically. You still there with us? Yep. Yep. Yeah. Talk to me. No. Some type of interference. Yeah. Talk to me. Yeah. Yeah. It's still breaking from that. Yeah. Let me see here. Go ahead. Talk about the game and let's see what we have here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cheese game. Chief Raiders. Trying to fix the audio here, guys. Hello. No. Hello. Yeah. I can hear you, but it's, it's, it's tough to hear. It's a break up. Yeah. Hello. Yeah. I can hear it. I can hear it. It's just not good. Yeah. You hear it? I hear it. Better? No. No. Better? Still, still tough. Yeah. It's whatever that thing is. I think maybe I need to get a new one. Yeah. A blue, I think. Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead. All right. We'll stick with it. All right. So what do we got? We've got all these talk, right? You can just look at that on the other side. You can see the, you know, All right, so what do we got? We've got all these talk, right? You while Greg gets everything straight now and over there. We got Carolina and we've got Denver Carolina and Denver We got a here's what I love right fantasy farm sports. We talk about fantasy sports all the time Okay, I think if you're looking for a little bit of running backs this week, right? I loved I love Javante. What are you? I love Jaliel McLaughlin Right and I love estimie in deeper leagues That's a guy I like estimie in deeper leagues esteem esteem in deeper leagues I like McLaughlin and Javante Williams is nice as well John Javante Williams should give you a monster week Carolina is a joke This is how hilarious Caroline is as hilarious as Tennessee. They're beautiful places to visit, but at the end of the day They're not good. They're not good football teams, but they're nice towns, right? Deontay Johnson does not Want to play today He's not playing because he knows Andy Dalton gotten I want to reach out real quick I hope that Andy Dalton's in Good health his wrist got banged up in a car injury this week And so we want to hope that he has a nice speedy recovery and he's not really banged up But Deontay Johnson is now going to be nursing his injuries Throughout this whole entire week because he's getting Bryce young the price young experiment is over in case you guys are still Holding out hope I know Greg's a big Alabama fan, but Bryce young is gonna be one of those guys that does not make it End of story bingo bingo gonzo Bryce young now has a wide receivers that are sitting out Yeah, I still Deontay Johnson Deontay Johnson so banged up Deontay Johnson is banged up and he's taking the week off Because he's not gonna get banged up more with a quarterback out there trying to kill him Denver minus 11 Hey, you know it feels like a lot of points, but it's probably one of those that that Denver wins by 20 to be quite honest I know Greg agrees with that right Greg Are we better now? No loud or bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad Can you use you sound like a machine almost you sound like a robot Mmm. Yeah. All right, so we took Denver. I think you agree. There's not a lot there, right? Denver will take Denver. I've got two check marks by Denver. Um, the real I'm gonna wait on this one. We'll talk about the non games, right? Well, Greg still gets things straight now over there Can't see she's versus the Las Vegas Raiders the raiders are getting nine and a half. They feel like they're down and out. They're not the greatest Football franchise right now, even though the goat is now in Vegas nine and a half The one thing that bought that scares me about this game is the last real embarrassing loss That the Kansas City Chiefs had was to the Raiders and And I think there's a little bit of interesting to that Right because I don't believe That that a Patrick Mahomes hasn't had a great year, you know, I know this guy's heard that guy's heard They haven't been hurt forever Patrick Mahomes has not had a good year And I believe that that defense which has held up their end of the bargain in Kansas City Might be a little soft this week because they know they're getting a no-conal. They know they're getting no Devonte Adam But I think a no-conal and Jacoby Myers could have a nice connection today more fantasy guys, okay And I do believe that although Although you do not want to bet this on the money line the Vegas Raiders Could upset the big dogs in Las Vegas. Look at the same thing we were talking about Miami The Arizona could have been there to party all week. I believe that the Las Vegas Raiders could have a ton of Kansas City Chiefs in those casinos in Vegas It's definitely a possibility and it's something I want you to think about when you think that this is an easy bet Looking at that nine and a half. I've got taking the Las Vegas Raiders nine and a half today. I Think it's a real close call for Kansas City and Kansas City wins But barely That's what I have. I got nine and a half good at Las Vegas Raiders moving on We'll talk about the late game because I know if we get Greg back. He'll want to talk about certain games. So I Want to leave some some thoughts there for him. I've got the Giants. I've got the Steelers 36 and a half and The Giants are getting six points traveling to Pittsburgh and I know we all watched that game last right? Yeah, yeah, Greg you back yet? No, okay, we all watched that game we understand that We understand We understand That the Pittsburgh Steelers Should absolutely destroy They have to destroy But these two teams kind of work like each other don't they? Think about it. When you think about the Steelers and you think about the Giants They kind of want to do the same thing both of them want to run the ball Both of them need to run the ball And I understand that Russell Wilson looked really good. Did the Jets quit last week the Jets did quit Just a little last week they quit We got to be honest the Jets quit And that's okay if they quit but we know they did and Pittsburgh broke their back. I think the Giants are gonna fight really hard here 36 and a half There's not a lot of room at 36 and a half 36 and a half there's not a lot of room at 36 and a half for six points. I You know and I again, I think the Giants every single player is fighting for their NFL career there They want to take parts. They want to believe they want to still think that their NFL dream is alive The Daniel Jones is the world who haven't played too bad, but hasn't played too great I'm gonna take the Giants with the points thinking then that Pittsburgh game last week the was an overreaction I Gotta believe that because at one point last week The Jets were up by a lot by a lot and Then Aaron Rodgers started throwing the game away That's what happened. We all watched it. He just started throwing the game away and I don't think Daniel Jones will throw the game away. I think he'll be more apt to run And move the pocket and do better in those respects I understand the Pittsburgh Steelers are the best team in football But just be careful with thinking that they're gonna cover and beat down the New York football Giants I got the Giants at six you Greg you there yet or no? All right, not quite yet, but we're still working on Greg there All right game ones about ones like well, whoop, can you hear me? Yeah, yeah I want to talk about the Chicago Bears the Chicago Bears are Out of hibernation this winter They are playing against the Washington commanders, right the Washington commanders They have done a really good job They have you know Pairing the the right quarterbacks together. That's what we'll talk about first right Jane Daniels got injured last week Right her ribs right cracked bruised whatever I don't know what the x-rays showed and they're not gonna tell you either But I will tell you that when they got rid when they lost him and went to Marcus, Mariela Do you see what these teams are doing here? What they're doing is they're they're Trying to mimic the backup as if he were and had the same talent and skills Maybe on a small sample size as the starter That's what these teams are doing Washington is mirroring the backup with the starter and that way when Mariela comes in They know how to react It's not a lot different it can't be because the operations and everything have to be able to run as if The teacher was there and not the substitute so This game was plus three and Now it's a pick them and it's a pick them because Jaden Daniels has worked those extra two points So if he's worth those extra two points, you gotta believe that Daniels is probably healthy enough To at least play So My thought is Is that this this has gone from a minus three to a minus one in Washington? Washington's defense has gotten a little bit better, but I don't think they're Chicago Chicago came into this year haven't worked really hard to even get wins last year and In their ability to win They leaned on themselves. I think Chicago is The better football team I Maybe not necessarily the best quarterback That I think could be true Jaden Daniels healthy is the better quarterback. I think Caleb Williams Does enough in this game to quarterback his team to victory Those could be truths those I like Chicago going to Washington today and Getting that victory and it's a big win for Bears football It'd be nice if Washington Quinn, but Washington's doing all of the winning That's all they're doing is winning and I just think that we need to dial it back for a minute and And get under control and look at what these teams really are and I think Chicago's the better football team I really do and you know, I've been wrong before but I don't think I'm wrong today In fact, that might be the game I take that might I'm not doing a bet your house this week because I don't believe I think the house Could could crashing down a burning but I do believe that Chicago has a few more answers than Washington has and and that's the way we're looking at things Greg Did we get you back yet? Are you with us? I'm just talking to them about the games that I like and how we're gonna get this done How we're gonna win I want Greg to be able to I Want him to be able to participate in talking about the San Francisco 49ers game because he is He's the biggest 49ers fan. I know he is you know in This year I've had a little bit different kind of trouble Because their defense hasn't been very good right and You know if your defense isn't very good You're making your offense do extra work and your offense has been banged up and You know if your offense has been banged up you can't move the ball obviously And I'm trying to message Greg right now Let him know that we're talking about the 49ers that way he can make sign language and cheer for what our opinions are Let's see if he gets that text message Brock Purdy's been good too don't Don't think that Brock Purdy has been lesser because he's made mistakes Who cares? It doesn't matter Brock Purdy has made mistakes. He's not perfect Purdy anymore He's still nice, but he's no longer perfect Purdy And I think we're gonna have to live with some of that We're gonna have to live with some mistakes and you know what I don't care what Kyle Shanahan says He's a bum. I Don't like that Kyle Shanahan Locker side talks and all this other Garbage that goes along with it. I don't like that. I Think what we need to do is we need to live with the fact that Brock Purdy is not perfect. Who cares? Who cares that he's not perfect? They are playing against your Dallas cowboys and America's team it might be But I don't Think they're really America's team. I think that's you know that they've been given that moniker many moons ago and And You know, they've kind of just lived with it the Dallas Cowboys are getting four and a half the San Francisco 49ers are minus four and a half Over under in this game is 47 hmm 47 so You know what Vegas does here is they want you to believe something They want you to sit there and go 47 points could that be a 24 to 23? And then you start moving point values around to try to get to where you want to be whether it be the over whether it be the under Okay You know Dallas looked so terrible last time out and I know that the 49ers look a mess at times I really would love to get Opinion on this Greg's opinion on the 49ers is is almost Gospel at this point, you know and we are Sunday and it is Church and I really would love to I don't want to just kind of I just don't want to give you guys my opinion on this That wouldn't be fair to the viewer that wouldn't be fair to our listeners Perfect party he is not Well, let's talk about Dak Prescott because his season hasn't looked great either Dak Prescott when the past is perfect he can put it on the money, but to have The the weakness That he has I think he handcuffs the cowboys. You can't run They don't run it very well. You need to be able to you know, Jerry Jones made comments this week about Derek Henry About how he wouldn't fit their offense Who wouldn't fit their offense? Why would you okay? He's not gonna fit your offense. Can't you build a more productive house? Instead of living in the same one that you're in you could build a more productive He you know Derek Henry You know you brought him like McCarthy because he's this great offensive mind Well, if he was such a great offensive mind couldn't he incorporate a great running back? Couldn't he I mean I just believe that You know if you know the that's like the Lakers back in the day You know it's shaker Kobe because they can't coexist and we're not gonna have them coexist either You know the fact of the matter is is that they brought in a guy who was able to get Everything working You know they brought in a guy that was gonna get everything at the whole machine going and that was Phil Jackson Now if you don't have a guy that gets the whole machine working, why have the guy? You need a guy to run the whole machine and that's not McCarthy now Jerry Jones understands that But he's stuck So he's got to say whatever he's gonna say to keep his sponsors The fact the matter is he's not even the best. He's not even the best pony in Dallas anymore Not even the best pony No best pony the best team is Houston, Texas Can you hear me? No What's what's going on I have no idea I Sounds like you're calling me from space. Yeah I'm gonna go I'm gonna go I'm gonna go all right Hello, yo wow That was that did something can you talk now talk say something words Talk to us You talk talk talk talk talk you say something say words All the static is gone all the static is gone All the static is gone Ah the calm before the storm We are still live so the static is gone So as long as the static is gone, I'll talk to you guys for a few minutes Greg's still trying to figure this out. I I Think the 49ers are just a better football team than the Catalan Cowboys I think the Cowboys can play well because the 49ers secondary isn't very good It's not I don't make the rules. I Go okay, Greg can hear me. Yeah, this is good. Yeah 49ers secondary isn't very good but I think Dallas is competitive here So this is the way and I think this is fairly how you could see it happen, right? We're in san francisco. We're not in Dallas Not in Dallas And I think the four and a half that Dallas is getting You know, it's one of those that feels good Feels good to be getting four and a half as a cowboy. It feels like oh, well, that's a line. We should take but you know what We'll get mispriced and burned and cashed out all day So what I would do here is I would just take the 49ers on the money line It's it's the honest play If you trust your eyes here You will you will not get poked all you right. You won't look like a stooge You don't want to look like a stooge Don't get your eyes poked out Where's that camera? There it is. Don't get those eyes poked out Believe in what san francisco has there They have a good running game at jordan mason. I know it's not christian mccaffrey They have a good quarterback and brock purdy No, he's not perfect purdy, but he's good You have an organization that knows what they are Playing one that is unstable unhinged And they're saying all the right things Because they don't believe in anything else Dallas doesn't have a good running game They have a fine quarterback But we believe that he doesn't have a great arm That's probably the same kind of arm that san francisco has Brock purdy And at least Brock purdy knows what he is whereas dak press got still trying to prove that he's worked that big contract And jerry jones hopes he is But I don't know and if I don't know I don't spend my money That's how I feel. I don't know. I can't spend my money. I won't do it I think that you can bet the san francisco 49ers here today because I think that they're the clear cut in their division And dallas just feels like uh, uh They feel like a bet you want to make but they don't have the record You know bill parcells Says you are what your record is I think we can end on this because I don't think we're gonna get grabbed back. I think we can end on this day bill parcells says you are What your record is And I think the 49ers have showcased the fact that they're not The team that we found and saw last week. They're not they're not as good but I think they know what they are their identity is clear and not much has changed I believe in the 49ers franchise much more than I believe In the dallas cowboys and what their record is and what they are doing I gotta believe in the 49ers. So what I would do Is I would absolutely Bet On the 49ers today And I would leave the dallas cowboys the second best team In dallas Or the second best team in texas alone take those 49ers On the money line guys be very careful today. You want to be very careful Okay, that's what we want to stress to you Be very careful with your bets. You don't have to take everything. You don't even have to play this week Enjoy your family. Enjoy your food. Have your drinks. Enjoy your day off Because it's monday tomorrow whether your heroes or failures In your bets today And there's a lot of potholes out there and i'm not sure your suspension On that vehicle that you're driving all that money that you've made these past couple weeks can put up with it Do a lot of watching today And ain't gonna hurt you and ain't gonna hurt me. I'll do a lot of watching today Those games we picked are the ones that we believe in the most But do be careful, please greg The pleasure as always I'm signing off for the day Enjoy the rest of your sunday football Weird stuff, baby halloween and everything enjoy or sunday My
