 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go. What's up, Wild? Yeah. That's some Sunday edition. Live reaction, man. Today was a good day. Woo! It's always sunny in Philadelphia when you're winning. Yes, sir. We had a great, great, great, great, great day today. First of all, happy Sunday. Appreciate y'all for pulling up and watching. If you're not watching this on Sunday, whatever, whenever you watch it, we appreciate you. You know what I mean? And we're glad to see y'all walking back. If y'all did not know, this is a No Box Sports podcast brought to you by No Box Entertainment. And I'm one of your hosts, and I go by the name of Uncle Doug. And I'm the original CP3. The original, you better not forget, man. And this is episode eight, and we just so happy to be feeling great, man. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Two wins. We don't know why. Two wins. We ain't even... Listen, we're going to get right into it with the Eagles. We know what y'all came in for. The Eagles held it down today in a major way. And we got our first whenever in the city of Cincinnati versus those bangles, man. Clap it up for the Eagles, man. Give it up for them. Give it up for them. And if you have long watching, clap. Clap. D-A-G-L-D-F. You know. You already know. We keeping that going, man. Keep it going. We keeping it going. Yes, man. Our birds are five and two now. Five and two now. What we going to do now, man? How the five and two Sunday going for you over there, man? Man, it was definitely... I was definitely nervous in the beginning, bro. When I saw, you know, that 10-3 score. Yeah. It was seven up and then 10-3. And it's like, oh, okay. What's happening here? And, you know, I got a little... I felt a little better when we tied it up. You know, they tried to rob us. One and a half time. They tried to rob us. They did try it. They did try it like it wasn't in 4K. They tried it, but... That out the jail of hurt. Shout out to the people in the booth for looking out for us. Because I didn't know how they was going to challenge that. Because they didn't call. They didn't say it was a touchdown. As far as I understand the rules... Oh, it looked like it was about to be another play run. Right. So it's like, you know, as far as I understand the rules, it's only an under review if it's a touchdown, as far as I thought. So I was like, okay, hey, but it worked out for us. And we went in the... In case y'all didn't know, he was talking about going in the halftime. Going in the halftime, we was down 10-3. We had drove to the goal line. We was trying to punch it in. It took us two tries and it was a... It was a touch push. And we didn't get in and they reviewed it and they see jail and hurts. Fort and gave just enough effort to where we got to 7. Then we went in the halftime 10-10. We got a little bit of hit of ourselves at halftime, but do you remember when it looked like it was about to go for two after we scored right there? Do you remember what's feeling when you seeing that? Because I was mad. And what y'all doing trying to go... What they did. I wasn't... I was perplexed. I'm gonna say that. I was perplexed. I was definitely like, okay, why are we trying... What's the difference between one point? And then at the longer they took the hike, I was like, okay, he's just trying to get through them all. So it didn't take me long. Once you start doing a hard count, we knew it. But in the beginning, I'm like, what is we doing? But let's get to it, man. In case y'all didn't know the score, we talked about it was 10-10 and a halftime, but this is the way it ended up. Dang! 37-17. Beat them by Dubb in Cincinnati for the first win of the man. Like y'all know, 10-10. But when in the halftime, first of all, we did not score a point in the first quarter. Let's address the elephant. That stat can go on another week. That's a weird stat. And I don't know what's going on with that. And I'm not really saying we wasn't rolling in the first quarter this week because we actually did score on our first drive this week. So the stat won't necessarily show you that. But Cincinnati, when they came out, they went right down the field, like you said. They drove every third down converging. They was getting, it looked like they were going to have the answer for our defense and all the Philly fans, the group texts, social media, not this again. They were snapping. They went right down the field, score seven. But that drive took almost 11 minutes. And when we got the ball back, we went on the long drive as well. But we wound up getting three. We didn't score. But we did score on the first possession, even though it wasn't in the first quarter. But we did start a little slow. But it was back and forth, man. Literally, they drove, we drove. They drove, we drove. This was two teams that, shout out to the Bangles because they're a good team. They're a solid team. But this was a situation where it was a dog fight. We showed some perseverance throughout the game. I think the first half, I really want to salute the defense because it looked like it was about to get bad, man. It looked like it could have, they could have scored three times, at least 14, the way they went down the field in first two drives. But the defense made a few plays, man. Just off top, Smith, Nolan Smith, you starting to hoop, bro. You starting to hoop. No, no, no, no. I ain't going to say about time. This is second year. He's starting to do his thing. He's starting to get to the quarterback regularly. I'm about to start expecting that from him now. He seemed like he's figuring it out. Josh, I think you've been solid all year. Carter, of course, they was double teaming him. I watch him all game, man. They got to double him. It's just, they don't got no choice, too. Bryce Huff had a few pressures, but the defense played well today, man. Shout out to 53, man. Zach Bond, man. That guy, that guy's solid, bro. That guy is solid. And I ain't gonna lie. I didn't know about him. I ain't know about him. I was kind of upset they didn't let them white play. I didn't like that they let him go like that. But looking at how I was playing out with Zach Bond and Dean. Yeah, I was going to say, McCoby Dean, you got to give them props too, man. Especially, we just need, honestly, we need him to stay healthy because like last season, right, right, right. This season for him and he got hurt. The problem is it just, we just need him to stay healthy. But he's always been considered, Tom on the Kobe has always been considered, you know, a good prospect for us. It's just that can he play a full season? And he's starting to show that, you know, he's definitely one of the guys that, you know, him and Bond is definitely, we got some good linebackers, man. Yeah, yeah, they played well today. They played aggressive bond, forced to turn over a crucial turnover. I think it was in either late third or early fourth. Right. We punched the ball out of an awareness play. Yeah. The defense played well. That's what we getting to now. We getting around to saluting the defense. Cornerbacks corner, I mean, that's a, that was a tough, we said, we said last week, you know, that that was going to be a tough matchup. Jamar, going against Jamar Chase and T Higgins. And yeah, yo, we held him to 17 points, man. You know, I only scored two touchdowns. So like that, that all, if our cornerbacks stunk, we should have got, that score should have been flipped. It should have been worse. There's no reason it shouldn't have been worse. And just T Higgins didn't play today. He had a little quiet injury. He suffered Friday and didn't play. But Jamar Chase was out there. Boy was out there and they got solid backup receivers and they got another quarterback. So you definitely expect them to be able to do things, more things versus the Eagles in the pass game. And it does show that our cornerbacks are here. And we did have slag with Elwood injury. It looked like a groan injury. I think that was the second quarter. And he did not return. So in his place, Isaiah Rogers snaps went up. He made a hell of a play, I think in the third quarter. It might have been the fourth quarter where he tipped the ball to put some CJ DJ to get a pick. And you know, that just added to that momentum we had at that time. But like you said, man, Sorry, sorry, Coach, you all, but honestly, you know, like, you could debate if Slay would have been able to on that route, that particular route, you had to have somebody fast to keep up with Jamar Chase, even. OK. It's the biggest. Well, you already know I said, what, we, one or two, I was already questioning Slay. So it's like, yeah. And so it's like, in some ways, the injury was actually, I mean, we still need him. We need all hands on deck. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, healthy slates. It was a blessing in disguise, kinda, in the sense of, I don't know if he would have been able to keep up with Jamar Chase to even deflect that in the CJ's hand. So. Right, right. And just to put it in perspective, Bradbury ain't play all season. He's still more injured and reserved. A lot of people forgot he was on the team. Slade been playing, you know, he been playing OK, but he went down, he been bad on through injuries the last couple of weeks. So they caught up with him a little bit. But the young boy stepped up, Ringo came in, made some plays. Isaiah Rogers was in there. We had Cooper DeGene flying around. We had the youngers out there, and they were holding their own. It didn't look like they were, and Cincinnati had the pass. So, you know, they were down. So it wasn't like they came in there, and you know, they just was running the clock out on the other side. We got some OK pieces in that deep back, man. That we can stay healthy and keep it all together, man. I'm feeling good about our defensive backs move before, especially because we got James Bradbury coming back. Yo, you gotta stop this James Bradbury. You gotta stop, man. You can't get on me about Quin Yaw Mitchell. You bring it up, James. This Quin Yaw Mitchell is playing. You up here talking about James Bradbury. What we talking about? We talking about James Bradbury. Yeah, yeah, James Bradbury, man. Well, you ain't even talking about Quin Yaw today. Like, we got a Quin Yaw Mitchell's original CP3 counter on the show now. It's getting to the point where do I need to? It's getting to the point where it's like, you know, unless he get an interception, it's like he just does what he does. Like, you know what I mean? What he do? You know, he's just, he's starting to be like, he just does what he does. Like, this is good to hear. He does what he does. It's already looking like he just does what he does, man. He definitely does what he does, man. And he did what he had to do today, and the Eagles did what they had to do today. We salute in the defense all the way from the top to bottom. Real quick, man, if you watching this across any platform, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Twitch, wherever you at, man. Make sure you like, make sure you comment, make sure you share, man. Talk to us. Who was your MVP today? How y'all feeling, man? Let me go over to Instagram. Born Diva, shout out to your cus. Appreciate you tuning in. Fly Eagles Fly for sure. I hope everybody is feeling good tonight. And we end the new Sunday just right. Hope this is a great, great week coming up. And the defense definitely did their part of making sure we had a great week. But the offense had a few things they wanted to say, too. Man, how you feel about your boy Jalen Hurst today? You know what, man? I think I may just have to. It's one of those things where it's kind of like sometimes when you are in relationships and stuff like that. And you kind of like, you have this expectation that these things you want to happen. And then you end, you kind of settled in the relationship. And then you realize, OK, there comes a point where you just got to realize, OK, I got to see this person for who they are. Who they are. Who I'm with. He doesn't have the arm, the arm talent maybe that you want to necessarily have in regards to arm strength. Excuse me. Arm strength if you want to have in your quarterback possibly. I could see that. This bull is making play. And that play where he faked it here, everybody on the left side. And he faked it to Saquon and just ran in for the touchdown. Like that's a cut. He was balling today, man. And then he balled. That's Rota Devante. Like, he does that. He's like, oh, you don't think I have arm strength? Watch this. Did it on the ground. Did it through the air. Check you out, man. Giving Jalen praise at the same time, dropping some real relationship advice for people out there that's watching. Y'all may be in relationships. You got to love the person you with. Yeah. You got to accept the person you with. You know, love their qualities. Don't expect something else just. But you definitely got to hold them to the expectations of where they're doing what they should be doing and can be doing. True. And now Jalen is actually doing that. And he's balling today, man. You see CP3 game over. Over 200 yards passing. I mean, got to come over to hit, you know. Mad fact, let's go ahead to the stats, man. And shout out to Lauren over there on Facebook, checking us out. She said Jalen definitely did a great job today. And we agree with that 100%. Jalen was hooping. Shout out to you for tuning in. Let's go to the stats. That's what we're saying. He was hooping. He was 16 for 20. 236 yards, one touchdowns, zero interceptions. That's the big one right there. Zero interceptions. That's the big one right there. No fumbles, I don't think, and no interceptions. Zero interceptions. That's big. No turnovers. Not turning the ball over. And you know Jalen Hurts, he also come with his feet, you know, what he do on the ground. So he had 10 for 37 and three touchdowns. And that was not one. But shout out to Jalen Hurts, man. He definitely hooped. Now, I got to say, man, it's one of the best games I actually watched Jalen Hurts play. This year, for sure, since he been to Eagle, I know the numbers wasn't sexy. But they got the job done, man. And he didn't really make no mistakes. So shout out to Hurts, man. This is one of the best games I say. My biggest problem with you is turning the ball over. You can't do that, man. Can't turn the ball over at that rate that you was. And you cleaned that up, man. I don't think you turned the ball over. Last two games, I think. Last two games. At the Browns, he ain't turned it over. He ain't turned the last three games he didn't turn it over. Oh, seriously? Because remember, we hit the tailgate. And if y'all didn't see the tailgate, I think that was episode number six, or episode number five. We was live at the Eagles-Tales game. Eagles versus Browns. Go tap in. In case y'all didn't know, this is the No Box Sports podcast. Both of you buy No Box Sports Entertainment, man. This is our second season. This episode eight for us. But we got a whole season on YouTube. Go check out the archive, the whole season one. We do a lot of Eagles, a lot of Sixes. We mentioned the Phillies and Flyers sometime. But we do what we could do when we could do it. Go check them episodes out and catch up when we hang up off here today and tap in with us, man. If you out there talk to us, man, we're going to start bringing fans on. We host and watch parties. We doing a lot of things. We trying to interact for the community, with the community. Because the Esmer Sports are the best, man, when it's done in community. When we get to share this win and this energy like that, man. But besides Hertz, man, what stood out to you the most about the Eagles win in Cincinnati? I'm feeling good about. Just continue to feel good about Saquon. First of all, I do feel bad about Will Shipley. I really wanted him to get that touchdown. The end of the game. I felt bad for him. That would have been great. But yeah, Saquon, man. He just continued. I just, it's like, on the one hand, I don't want Jaylin to keep doing the tush push because I want him to preserve his body. Because I thought Saquon coming in would help maybe stop that. But honestly speaking, if the idea is we trying to preserve Saquon for the playoffs, I guess I got to fall back and say, OK, we got to do, we got to do. But to Saquon, he continues to, yo. He's balling, man. That guy's a great guy. Just a solid football player, man. Solid football player. And we not really conserving him like that. I mean, that's 22 carries right there in the board form. That's a lot of carries, a lot of tackles, a lot of, not to mention the blocking and other things that come with Saquon. So Saquon is definitely carrying it, man. We definitely got no complaints about that guy, man. And when you finish in the game, like, we finished in the game with a lead. And now we just get to run the ball. And we're handing it to him. He already tired in our old line, getting stronger. And shout out to the old line. Let's not go no further without paying homage to the old line, man, because. We're not even at full strength. You're right. Nowhere near full strength. We down two starters, man. And guys are stepping up. And guys is playing well, man. So shout out to them. I didn't look at this game today and feel like we had a deficit at the old line. We had a penalty here and there. But overall, you would expect us not to look like we looked today. So shout out to the old line. Shout out to Hertz. Shout out to Barclay. What I love about Barclay, man, is that it's not only that he finds the holes and we protect, you know, we give him the protection that he needs to make those holes. Right? Right, right, right. But the bull also just punishes guys, man. Like he's just like. He's not giving no passes, though. Like Ken of Gangwell has to kind of find a hole and kind of hit it. And you know, maybe Duke a little bit of spin he'll get through. But it's like he's not knocking guy over, right? You know what I mean? Right, right, right. You know what I mean? But Saquon, like it's he can make a five yard carry. Like he did today, make a five yard carry, turn it to a 10 yard run. You know, like. You got to really tackle Saquon. You really do. You really got to tackle Saquon. You know, he's quite he's quite 800 pounds. You know, Saquon not playing with people. So when it comes to tackling him in that fourth quarter off. Yeah, he in. I ain't even going to speak on that. But we looking good, man. We looking good. We got to get back healthy. Jalen Hurts, I love the way you playing, man. And and when Miz was on the show, Miz was on episode seven. Y'all make sure y'all go check that one out. Miz talked about how he want to see Jalen Hurts more decisive when he's going to run. Right. And today we've seen that. We've seen that. I see him hit two reeds today and take off. I see it. And then that's what I really want to see. I want to see Zaylin Hurts understanding. Sort of like Lamar Jackson. I know Lamar Jackson is, you know, eight years in almost nine. Maybe seven. I don't know. But Lamar Jackson got to a point this year to where if you watched the Ravens play, like even if you watch that game of day, he literally is doing whatever it takes to win. Whether that means I'm going to rush for 90, or I'm going to throw for 300. It don't matter any given play. He got the ability to do it. If the play is there, he's going to, if the play is to run, he's going to take that run. He's not going to hesitate. But he also, but also to your point, he's not always just quick to run. You know, he does like I need to, I need to throw the ball to get this long, you know, first down. I'm going to do that. But if I got the run, I'll do it. Yeah, you're right. He's definitely is. He going through that evolution right now. I feel like you start off doing what you know, and he running as a quarterback. Cool. Then you get to the point that we're, what you was saying? I was going to say, my only concern when it come to us with the running with Jalen is we got two number one receivers. And from my understanding of history, number one receivers, they want the ball. When you show those, I'm looking at those stats that you show. Ain't a lot of receptions. No. You know, between two number one receivers. So it's like, you know, six and five, that's, you know, so hopefully they good with that. Hopefully, you know, whatever it takes to win, hopefully they good with that. If that becomes the formula where we doing, you know, they only getting six to five receptions. I don't know how many targets each of them have, but let's just the six to five reception seems kind of like for two number one receivers. Right. You know, hopefully everybody is about the team. That's my only concern. You know what I'm saying? Last year, you heard a lot of stuff going on, you know, in regards to behind the scenes where it's stuff, there was drama and stuff like that. Hopefully everybody's good. And you know, they're working together yada, yada, you know what I'm saying? And that's definitely a concern. Definitely a concern, depending on the dynamics of your team. But I do think we got good dynamics with this team. Like, AJ and Devonte is really friends. Like they really home as you can tell. So we less likely to have a situation where one of them is hating on the other. And it seemed like they both eating. They just taking turns eating. And I think at the end of the year, they both gonna have a thousand yards again. AJ probably have a little bit more touchdowns, but Smitty probably be right there behind on. They both got their check. But you're right, man. That's not a lot of balls to go around. But I actually like when we win like that. No, I like when we win like that for sure, for sure. Because we playing solid. A win is a win, but for us as fans, but I don't know how, you know, we just hope, I just hope that the guys, if it's about, hopefully they have the same mindset, you know what I'm saying? Like, you know, they all got paid. So that should also help too. The fact that they all did. They all got the check. Yeah. So it's not a thing where they playing for contract and you like, yo, I need more balls. So I can get a bigger pay. Like they got, you know, they got their money. So hopefully that also helps, you know what I'm saying? But like it's definitely, if there's ever a concern, that could be a concern. People not, you know, that team chemistry being not as good as we hope it, hope it is. Right, right, right, right. The defense, I went to that. The Bengals was a good test. I definitely thought that going into this game, the Bengals was a good test. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, knock them now, they three and five because we made them three and five. Thank you. But it's like three and five for show. They are three and five. And it's like, you could, you know, skeptic, the skeptic can say, well, maybe they're not as good as we thought. They were, you know what I'm saying? So we're not doing that. We're not doing that today. We're not doing that at all, man. I'm with you. You said, what stood out to you the most in this win is Saquon Barkley. I'll say what stood out me the most in this win is the character that's being developed by this team. To see Cincinnati come out, score first, first drive. And then we go right back with another long sustained drive and score three. And then Cincinnati come out of score three and then we score. And then we just keep building on that. We're standing there in barrage, battle through injury, battle through flaky calls here and there. But at the end of the day, shrink it together. And at the end of the game, literally, he looked at team in a face and say, y'all not effing with us. And he closed the book on them for real. And that's not a light team. That's not an easy team to do that, too. They not shouted out with Patrick Mahomes. They not shouted out with the best of them. They not went to the Super Bowl already. So that's not an easy team to sit there and do that, too. So this Eagles team, I don't know, man. I'm feeling good about this win. Everybody feeling good about this win. You think we are turning the corner? Like, are we turning the corner as a football team? It's like, this the start of something great for the Eagles? I ain't ready to say that yet. Is this the start of a Super Bowl run for the Eagles? I ain't ready to say that yet. I ain't ready to say that yet. I'm sorry. I'm not. I'm not, man. Like, you know, we won three straight, but they was against the Browns. OK, OK. The Giants. All right. And the Bengals. Out of those three, like the Bengals probably. That's cool. That's solid teams. We ain't play no bums right there. What you mean? The bums we play. The Giants, they ain't that great. They got Daniel Jones. They not great. They're NFC East team. And you know they tough with anybody else. They play it's just that we send them around like that. The Giants got a few wins this season. They they carry that a little bit. They got the best, the most sacks in the league. I'm not going to act like they just a walk over team because we walked over. I'm sorry. Browns. The Browns just beat the Ravens today. And we going to have a look around the league. Stay tuned. OK, OK. So I'm not I'm not. I don't I don't. Yeah. I'm not going to say. Boom. So. Boom. So. I ain't saying we going but Philly fans. I don't know about you. But I'm the type of fan that want to win a championship every year. And if we can't win a championship is like, ah, it takes the joy out of it for me. But this one of them years where I'm looking like, OK, this this the door is still open on this year for championship. And it's looking. Hey, OK. All right, I ain't saying it. But hey, I ain't saying it. Yeah, me. OK. So we turn in the corner now. Now what should we do? I think that's too early, man. Too early. I think it's too early. Oh, you got to see who we play next week. But I feel like it's too early, bro. What you need to what you need to see to say we turn on the corner like two more wins in a row. What? Yeah, maybe maybe two more wins. Two more wins. That's it. Wow. See, some people see before others. I'm going to say this was a my you medal win in our season. And as long as we can build on this and not lay a egg next week and we see this team really stacking it together, because it looked like the type of team that take the steps and stack the boxes up and at the end, they stepping at the top. So hold on. You can't you I answered your question. You said it's like they turn the corner. It was a big one. Yeah, it was a big one. Turn in a corner. But I don't know about saying if I say they turn the corner. You don't think this defense you don't think this defense is getting to a point where they understand the scheme and confident and running around and using their talent like like making plays. They are making plays, but we but but you also have to consider the level of talent they're playing against. And this is the first one. So we got we need more good teams were playing against where I can say that. We I don't agree with you about the Giants and the Browns, but I won't belabor it. But you know, that's my we disagree on it. OK, so he think we need to slow down Eagles fans. He is of the elk that you need to chill. You need to relax. You need to see some more. This is a season Eagles fans saying that I'm a season Eagles fan saying that listen, we turn the listen right when you walk around that corner right before your body get there, like you see in our shoulder come around that corner now we ain't all around it. But we like to. Who about round there? Yeah, Super Bowl around the corner. So all I'm saying is Eagles fans stay on stay on. We ride this thing. It's a beautiful thing. But enough about our Eagles. And we're going to go take a little glance around the league because when we talk about turning the corner, the rest of the league got this around that corner. But we did talk about the Browns already. You mean they beat the Ravens. So we just going to look around the league. So the Browns did beat the Ravens. It was a crazy game. I don't know if you've got a chance to see anything as far as that go. But listen, that game was wild. That was that was it went down to the last play, man. Incredible play. Hell, Mary, hell, Mary play. Hell, I look the Mark Jackson dog. If he got the ball in the last play, that's a scary sight. But Cleveland survived. James Winston, Stephens, you know, started for the first time for his homey to Sean Watson and got the win. Man, they put up some buckets. I played against I played. I had the Ravens defense and fantasy and it ain't go too well for me. But I'm shot out to the shot. I was shocked by that. He he actually pulled up 29 points. That's impressive. Twenty nine. It was twenty nine to four. James Winston's pass for three thirty four, three tetties. Yeah, he went 27 for 41. So he was out there hooping, man. Let's keep looking around the league. Though what else happened today? Detroit, man, they foot the. To Tennessee, man. Fifty two with the team. Do against the Titans. Yeah, they did with the teams doing against the Titans. Detroit is the most. If I had to pick the best team in the NFC right now on some non bias stuff, I would have to say Detroit is the best team in the NFC. They have shown it the most consistently. The firepower is there at elite firepower. And they got some defense to back it up. They is missing a hut to say he went down with the injury. But they looking good. The bills beat the Seahawks, thirty one ten. Josh Island on Josh Island things. They're Super Bowl contender for sure. Keep your eye on that. Hold on, man. Look at all that. Let's talk about the big game that happened at the end of the day. Come on, man. Oh, man. That's out of the vision. That's the big game. Like that man. Just the Bears, Washington commanders versus Chicago Bears, man. Kayla Williams versus Jalen Daniels, man. And that was it was a it was a thriller. I don't know if you're seeing it or not. But how did it end? What was the last play of that game? I mean, he threw up, you know, Daniels threw up a Hell Mary pass. The defender tipped it right to believe Noah Brown. Noah Brown just said, all right, all right, all right. And he's paid attention and caught that John in the end zone game over. Like that a lot of times you see those Hell Mary passes, man. Like, you know, and it doesn't he always like you see the guy like dropped it for every reason. It comes to me like, oh, you know, whether it's the thing or like he actually caught the ball and they won the game off that job. But I got to say, that was like the perfect tip. If I ever seen one dog like it literally went right in his hands. But this is the case, y'all don't know the the Washington one 18 to 15. It was a pretty low scoring game. It came down to the end. Chicago had drove down and scored a touchdown with like 50 seconds left. And it looked like they was about to win in Washington and Washington somehow getting to the position. Throw a Hell Mary and win the game literally on the last play of the game. Walk off touchdown. They look crazy. If you ain't see it yet, go check it out. It's definitely worth going to go watch the highlights, man. And now the Washington Command is a six and two and leading the division. I think we got to match with them in two weeks. It's going to be a battle, man. They a tough team down there to get magic at the last second now. They're going to be something to deal with, man. But we ain't got to deal with them right now. But that game was something that the Cowgirls, I think they playing right now. They playing a 49ers and the score looks like it's 73 to Cowgirls winning this early second quarter. So we'll see what happened in that game, man. Go Niners. Go Niners. I can't. We want to draw. We want to draw. We want to draw. You're right. We want to draw. I can't see. And that's just nasty. You know what? I can't. Hey, man, whoever played the Cowboys, I'm sorry, it's always going to be against the Cowboys. It's always going to be whoever I'm always rooting for the team against the Cowboys. But I guess I can root for a draw. Draw. OK, I'll go with that. We can go with that. I guess I'll go with that. But next week, man, we got to turn the page. We celebrate the night, but we don't stay there for too long, man. We got business to handle. The next opponent I think is the Jagwell, Jacksonville Jaguars, man. Jacksonville Jaguars, they coming to Philly, Dougie P, Trevor Lawrence. Who else they got? Brian Thomas, Junior Travis, Etn, Tanks, Bigsby. I mean, they got some pieces. They can put up a good game. They're that type of team that if you do not prepare properly, right? And you think they sweet, you will end up in a dog fight that you don't need to be it. So let's hope this team, that's when I say we got to build those blocks up. The next block will be coming in next week and handling them how we supposed to. Not having it look crazy like it's shaky again. You know, so next week, man, let's preview the game a little bit. I just named Jacksonville. We got the Eagles. We might we might be missing Slay, not sure. We had some encouragement by the rookie DB. So we should be all right. Otherwise, I don't know the status on my lot of. And I don't think he's going to be back. The boy beacon. Yeah, God, it was out with the hand me. So I don't know what's going on there. You know, this is right after the game. So we don't got the health reports. But just monitor that. But even with that in mind, man, how you feeling about that game versus Jacksonville? Jack, I mean, it's an expected win. You know, just like they say, what they say, those those losses are scheduled. That should be a schedule one for us. OK, it shouldn't be 20 to 16. Again, but I'm not going to jinx them like I did against the Browns. I'm going to be quiet on the score. But it should be a win like, you know, it's yeah, we should. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm definitely going to pick a win, too. I pick it a win as a win before the season. Although for transparency, I did pick us to lose today just because I knew we never won in Cincinnati and I now watch some weird games in Cincinnati and this trauma behind this Cincinnati, the Eagles in Cincinnati. And today, seeing the win actually felt real good because I just never seen that before. This is literally the first win. Now it makes sense in the history. So when I seen that on the schedule, I just was like, no, it's it's not going down. But that's why you that's why you're so excited about all the time in the corner. Could you try and make up for the fact that it might be it. It might be it. That might be it. I ain't going to let the therapist might say the same thing. If she heard me, just say, oh, that's what that could have been. But we still right. Even if you don't see our shoulder, we like you hear us. You hear that the Eagles come around the corner. But no, I feel like we should win, too, man. I feel like we should beat them. I don't feel like it should be close. I'm not going to say we should cook them by a certain amount, but I feel like we should have the game in hand in the fourth quarter. We'll ship. We should finally go ahead and get the kids touchdown at the end of the game. And we five and two after seven after eight weeks of the NFL season. And this is what I had as at five and two. It happened very different than I said it would happen. That is true. But this is what I had to say. I had us losing to Green Bay and I had us losing the Cincinnati so far. We didn't lose tonight. The team. But we are what I thought we would be. And let's keep it moving forward. It's the part of the season where I thought we can hit a shrine and let the league know we serious and really get our rhythm going to see can we start to dominate team as we get into our identity, which Nick Sariani said is physical. Physical identity. But shout out to the Philadelphia Eagles, man, on getting that win today, man. Salute to service, Salute to service. We're wrapping up the Eagles talk, but today was a good day for many of reasons. Many of reasons, man. We see multiple ways today. And then a certain sport we seen the first one. It was a day of first, man. It was the Eagles first ever win in Cincinnati. Right. And it was the 76ers first win of the NBA season in the overtime thriller to the Indiana Pacers, man. Yeah, we got to give it up for the sixes to why don't y'all give it up for the sixes, y'all. Give it up for. You want to chat? Throw some flames and something in there for the six. Yes, sir. Pee Jean, we playing without MB. You ain't see the real 76ers thus far this year. So it's kind of hard to really get a real assessment on them. But just watching them today in these last two games, man, I got to give a salute to service because they fighting. Be in they beat the Indiana Pacers today in overtime one 18 to one 14. Maxi had 42 points. The next leaders were 45, 45, my fault, Maxi. I'll never forget the three. Ubrey who? Martin who Martin has 17. Ubrey had 14. This was a team effort. May Eric Gordon have 15 came in, gave us some crucial offense, man. Can you Martin had eight McCain got 17 minutes today, which I loved seeing. I just love seeing the maker. That's letting me know we closer to the player coach getting less minutes. Come on, man. Come on, man. What color is the color is still solid for us. Stop it. OK, but I say. Well, keep going. Keep going. Keep going. I want to see McCain playing Reggie. Reggie Jackson didn't play at all. I think Nickners need to fix that. I don't know what's going on. I know what need to happen. But everybody played well, man. We got the win. Kishaw didn't know we lost to the Milwaukee Bucks open the night. Not open the night wins that they had to open the night. They got us. You know, it was too much game. It was too much. You're honest when it mattered. We had nothing to match it. But then we went into Ronto and we actually lost. They actually handled us down there. Defensively, the left bothered us. They were just they were sharper than this. And Maxi wasn't really on, you know, he's been shooting a lot, but not at a efficiency rate. And they got us. So today we was going to Indiana, who was a good team, a team that went to the Eastern Conference. Find those last year team that suspected to do things, a team that's healthy. We were imposing, like looking at the sixth schedule without him being in PG. There's probably one that you say we will lose. But right going to Indiana and we get the win in Indiana. And we just get on the board. You know, we wanted to a lot of games left. How many NBA games is it? 82 last touch. So 82. God, 82, 82. Yeah, I stepped it up, though, man. Maxi Maxi doing what he got to do right now. You got to he's got to be the five. You got to be the leader. He don't have to score 45 every night, but he definitely got 45. He can't be doing on 18. He can't be just doing 20 point. He got to be 25 and up. Mm hmm. 25 and up, you say? Definitely got to average 25 and up right now while we don't have the two guys in at least 25, at least 25. OK, OK. Maxi, I think Maxi is definitely averaging 25. He's taken a lot of shots to get to that 25. But he got 25 today. He got to the 45. Um, Maxi, you being aggressive earlier in the season. That's what we need you to do. I like that. Um, the roleplayers looking good, man. I like how Martin looked. He he had a great game today, although he almost made a mistake that causes at the end, but it didn't cost us. Oobre still squished army knife, whatever you need. Right. Kenyan Martin, Jr. And, you know, elevated minutes. I like the way he looks. He's athletic, smart basketball player. I feel like Andre German as well, man. I mean, you know, he's playing Andre German doing his thing. Seventeen boards night. Yeah, so 17 boards, 37 minutes. That is major. And he say he's the greatest rebounder of all time. Like that's what he literally is telling people. So 17 rebounds, you backing it up. You can't have anything right now with you, the greatest rebound of all time. I least I get 11 rebounds. So you got at least 12. But shout out to the Sixers, man. Um, you give your way to early assessments of how they look. And even though we a little fracture right now, we looking like we're so, so without George and it be like we look like we solid. If we got those guys, right, we don't have those guys. We are we're probably a ninth seeded team, if that. And I'm sorry about Maxi, but Maxi's just not that guy yet. You know what I'm saying? He just not. He's not that guy yet to carry a team to like, you know, top five in the conference. So right, right, right. But but when those guys come back, like I'm definitely encouraged that, yo, we look like a solid team. We look like a solid team. I'll say that. But we got to have those two guys back. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree. We got to have those guys back. But I will say my early assessment is the NBA is in trouble because what he said without without PG, without him being, I don't think he's his ninth place. I think he carried it there, maybe six, seven. Now you got to realize we looking like this because we we kind of was preparing to go without him be. But the PG injury happened last week. We've been playing with PG. We've been setting up the offense with PG. Not there now. It's just Maxi and them. So they trying to figure this whole thing out on the fly and weigh the bucks. We should have people saying we should have been Toronto. Toronto might be a tough team right around that six to ten area fighting. And it looks solid. I ain't gonna lie. They got playmakers. They got a length. They compete and we just be the playoff team. So Maxi ain't necessarily look good this season as far as efficiency condition in as good, but he's he's just a little bit off and more of them should not start falling today. But but I think if we just had to keep building with this team, we would get the point to where we would be Toronto. Not saying we will be cooking them, but we will just be a solid team somewhere around six, seven. You know, but even saying that, I don't want to even think of a world of where we would have to do that because we got two stars. We're about to insert back in. So my thing is that we could be a six, seven caliber type team that can go at a number one team without two all stars and one generation of talent. Also, future hall of famers. Yeah. When we put them two back in, I mean, we're going to have to figure it out. But I might start looking like how the Eagles look where we play our game. Is not much anybody going to be able to do. And then that's what I'm seeing with the sixer team. I'm not saying they turn in the corner because we didn't even see it yet. But it's about the Ashley. They walking down the block. They walking down the block. Yeah. Yeah. I'm about to ask you. I say, you feel like they turn. Right here. OK. Right there. They right here. No, I got you. I got you. We're going to be all right, man. Yeah, we just need those guys back. We definitely need those guys. We are not without those two guys. I'm not sure I'm with you on the faith walk. I don't even want to think of our team without those guys at all. That's fair. I just don't. Philadelphia 76ers next game versus Detroit. Pistions down here. I'm at the at the what's we call the Wells Fargo Center now. I don't know how long it's going to be the Wells Fargo Center. They talking about some other things. Some ain't the secret moving and moving the stadium. So I don't know. But we down there, we wanted to play the Detroit Pistons. They own three. But K. Cunningham is hoping right now. I feel like we should be able to get the two and two versus them. I don't know how you feel. I don't think we have until we get our two guys back. So far, the three games that we've shown, I don't feel overly confident about anybody. There's nobody that we can say, oh, we should win that game. No, it's going to be a good game to probably. It might be a close game. You know, it's the Pistons and they supposedly still stink. We probably gonna be close for us. Philly. You're we Philly. 1030. I'd be about 1030. 1030 24. I just thought of something. Philly, this is three days from now. What's that? That Wednesday. The Wednesday. Yep. And B might be back that game. They say and B could play at. They say he might just sit the first three games. This was planned. They say he'll be reevaluated. So he can possibly be in the lineup. He's not like recovering from an injury. He's just gearing up properly. They don't want him to go from. They don't want him to. Like, you know, you got an old car and you build, you trying to speak somewhere you can't go zero to 20. That's why somebody pulled up one of you at next to the light in the old car. You look straight. You don't even look at him. You know, you know, when your car got that giddy up, you looking over like, what's up? It does and B, he that type of car that is vintage can do whatever any car can do. So we've never seen before. But we got to ramp him up. We can't just let him go. And I'm surprised that NBA is hating on it so hard because he's sitting back. The bags are not playing early. I get off fire situations, man. Oh, man. I guess the art. That's the age. I won't say age, but that's the argument that people have in regards to you. Do I do understand the argument that you got people come from out of town to see and be you got people that that come that's in town and want to see and be they pay that money to see and be played and not coming there to see Maxi. It's like I get that aspect. When you go to see the Temptations back in the day or any group, you know, it's like you want to see the 10th. You ain't want to see a bunch of fake people want to see David Weffin. You ain't got to try to see. You know, I come to see you on this drumming. Like, you know, I'm saying like, so it's like, come on now. Like you want to see the stars. No, I get it. That aspect I won't go against at all. That's kind of drawn. I'm just talking about. I don't care about that, though. You I don't care. You lose your money. You lose your money. It's called gambling and sports and entertainment. Anything can happen. Anything can happen from game to game. You spend that money even if they're not playing. You go down to the stadium. You have a good time. You get in the mix and you enjoy it because you paid your money. Whoever regardless of who on the floor. But I think that's their issue. I think that's their issue in regards to why they do it, because they try to at least give the front, at least give the perpetration that we're trying to do what we write, what's right for the fans and stuff like that. You know what I'm saying? So I'm like, that's why they do these whole investigations and stuff like that. You know, I don't think they should have came out and said it like I don't. I don't know why and be right. Just I'm not going to play back to back. Why are you saying that and be I probably never again in my career. He gets to the point where he don't care no more. I don't know more. I'm done. You a funny guy. I don't know about your impressions, but you're a funny guy. You got a better impression than me. Let me hear it. You just got to trust it. No, would you write it? You write it's like, it's like, I'll allow. No, you write. They should they should have just did what, you know, quiet them always. They like, he can't play tonight for whatever reason, make up an injury. Like, don't write it. I say all that to say and be might be back Wednesday night and even if he's not back with the team, I'm projecting to beat them if the team with him be the team without him be. And just to be clear, somebody coming back to the city that day, he coming for blood. Tobias Harris is making his return to Philadelphia. Yeah, all that Tobias can't do this. Tobias, Corley, Tobias is on Tobias fault. Well, guess what? Tobias is back in the city in the starting line up, ready to give us 25. And I can't wait to watch that game personally because I just know as a competitor, as an athlete, in that situation Tobias Harris is sleeping 12 hours and 84 hitting all his routine. He going to get one of the massages downtown and he go, he go hit his shorty used to deal with a filly up like, oh, they can take care of me. Take care of me, baby. I'm back in town tonight. I and when he comes when the lights come on at seven o'clock, I'm watching that game start to finish, man. You're going, are you going to clap for him? I'm glad you think better not boot Tobias, dog. They better not boot Tobias, dog. Don't that'll be so that'll be so corny because because I went through the case of Tobias. You go check the YouTube channel. I sent the proper salute when he left because I thought he was a great role player that's whatever he had to do. What's the old phrase? Only as good as your last game. What was his last game? How many points you have in that last game? Did he have any points in that last game? I'm sure he has some points in the last game. I don't know about that. I'm sure he had a point in the last game. But but but don't make me go into Tobias Harris case right now. This is not a bias. Zero points in a playoff game. Should you get booed or not? That's my point. But we ain't going. I'm just one of the, you know, you want to give him a hand clap. Zero points in a playoff game. You want to give me a hand clap? OK, OK. You ain't going to run to it. I don't believe all the six of Spanish is going to fight. But I do because his last game. I'm finding it now because we gave him. He did nothing. I'm finding it because like you, you went there. This was the evil's podcast to buy for the pistons. You know, you know, he had no point. You have a man up. I had no point. He had four rebounds. He had four rebounds, three assists and no points. Yeah, I'm sorry. How many points? I'm sorry. What you said? Did you say one point? Did you say? But listen, he was over to the niggas and shoot the ball because it was being jacked. That's the game. Buddy Hill came in and put up like 10 shots. He had 20. The third option. Obviously not that game. He's getting booed. Guess who else had no points that game? He's getting booed. Guess who else had no points that game? Is your player coach? Yes. Is he still whatever, man? He's still on our team trying to help us. Tobias said, do you see any shit? Zero points. He's getting booed. Let's move on to bias. I'm never going to root against my team. But turn up when you come to the city to buy it. Real rap. You better. If you come around here and don't shoot, I know I ain't even got a couple to buy. I'm clipping this. You better come and drop 25 on. You better see U. Bray across and say, food, y'all want to this nigga to shoot over me? Food. And you better not let him. You better not let him do it. He was the U. Bray. He got to not let him do it. He got to not let him do it. Maxley. You big dog now. Don't let nobody come take your food. But I do want to see Tobias Harris who Wednesday tune in, man. That should be a fun one to watch. We got a lot of fun, six just content coming up. It's a long, long season. We're going to be here through all of it. We promise we're not leaving you. We with you forever and ever.
