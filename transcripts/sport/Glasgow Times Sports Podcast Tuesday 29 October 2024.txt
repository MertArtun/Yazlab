report by mark walker evening times sport october 22 major Celtic boost as key player makes return from injury report by david urban camman katar vickers has returned to Celtic training ahead of the champions league showdown against atalanta the 26 year old defender had been sidelined through injury and missed the loss to barusia dorkmond last time out in the competition katar vickers is thought to be back amongst his teammates ahead of the fixture in bergamot italy tomorrow in a recent press conference this month roger said of katar vickers i think what we're conscious of with him is that he had a wee bit last season where he was in and out even though it's a totally different injury this time it's one where we were told at that time it could have been anywhere between two and three months but we're just not wanting to push him back in too early which might then set him back so he's doing really well he still has discomfort there it's not as bad as it was for the brattislava game we don't think he's too far away from being where he wants to be so we're just trying to manage that and just react to each day he trains to see what the after effects are reported by david urban evening times sport october 22 whatkins says rangers win is no fluke reported by robbie hanratty madly whatkins believes calman deserved their narrow victory over rangers on sunday insisting his winning goal was not sealing a smash and grab result the airshare club picked up only the second scottish premiership win of the season yet their performers against rangers displayed why they are a match for anyone at roger park the 34 year old whatkins had a brilliant opportunity to score earlier in the game but wasted no time when he paused on a defensive mistake and fired behind rangers go keeper jack butland with three minutes of regulation time remaining and he said yes it was a great win i should have taken my first half chance but i'm just buzzing i managed to get that winning goal i thought we deserved it as we had the better chances against a quality team at home we always feel that we have a chance even if we miss one we know we'll get another it was a great ball in by davie whatson another great impact of the bench from ourselves killie success mounts further pressure on the rangers board with many supporters calling for their manager philly clemont to be relieved from his duties direct machinist's calmanok actually have a credible home record versus both sides of the glasgo divide in recent seasons and they have also held both tronzo and fc copen hagan to european stalemates earlier this season the two times capped wills international said we can beat anywhere but especially here at home when we're at it at our best then we'll give anyone a game you saw it here against copen hagan what can this acknowledge commander's slow start to the league campaign but believes their rangers triumph which took their unbeaten run to six games in all competitions has been down to a much needed reset within the squad and he explained i think a lot of our poor start was our own doing with sending off i don't think it was as bad as it seemed but it's good to get two wins in a row we'll look to build on it in the next game and keep it going it gives us confidence but i felt we always knew we could beat anyone here it's always good to go out there and actually do it though kicking on is important we set the standard high last season and we've got to make sure we reach those again report by robbie and ratty evening time sport october 22 manchester united put strict ticketing measures in place for rangers visit report by steward wilson manchester united are taking early measures to prevent rangers supporters from accessing the home sections of old trafford despite their uefa yopah league clash being over three months away according to a report from the daily mail the english premier league giants have decided to restrict ticket sales for the highly anticipated match said to pick place on january 23 to fans who were registered as exclusive members before the draw that paired the two teams took place this move follows last season's instance and with galatathasere where approximately 2000 turkish fans managed to secure seats in the home end causing embarrassment for eric 10 hags men who ended up on the losing side united chiefs are clearly worried about a similar theme occurring again should rangers fans get their hand on briefs out with their expected 3000 away allocation while discussions with various police forces are still to take place the club is proactively tightening ticketing rules to avoid a repeat of previous issues which caused some punters to hit out at the unsafe environment inside the iconic stadium report by steward wilson evening times sport october 22 rangers worse under clemont than they were under bale since chris void report by lana macai chris void has claimed philippe clemont's rangers side are worse than they were under michael bale in a damning review of the belgians first year in charge it has been an underwhelming start to the season for rangers who currently sit six points off the top of the table with 16 points from eight games with celty can abadine holding each other to a 2-2 draw on saturday the light blues missed out on a valuable opportunity to close the gap following sunday's disappointing one-nothing defeat to kumarnak at rugby park speaking on go ballistic on sun sports youtube channel void was asked whether he thought rangers were better or worse a year on from clemont to his charge worse he said there's no getting away from it i don't know where philippe clemont goes from here i'm not saying all the fans have termed but it's getting to that stage now there's something just not working at rangers it's a million miles from where it needs to be he was able to kick the can down the street in the summer he said he had to get new players in and get them up to speed they're up to speed they're performing and they are and they are just not up to the level rangers need them to be it is hard to build a case for saying there's been improvement in this department there's been improvement there and you feel as if it's going to get better in the long run i just don't see it the kill a performance is as poor as i've seen it in a long long time philippe clemont tried to predict the future in terms of we will be 200 percent better come october i really don't see it previous rangers manager michael bill was sacked last october after just 10 months in charge falling a three one defeated home to abadin rangers were trailing Celtic by seven points at the time after suffering a third league defeat in seven games former monaco and club bruge head coach clemont was named as bail successor signing a three and a half year contract the 50 year old was given a new deal in the summer keeping him at ibrics until 2028 boy do continued for me it's getting to the worrying stage the next couple of weeks is going to be massive you've got a european game on thursday night you've got a home game against st millon rangers have got absolutely no chance of getting anywhere near Celtic this season i could be left with egg on my face i've said absolutely no chance abadin finished second i still believe they don't but looking at it right now at least they're a team that's together they're a team that's fighting they're a team fighting for the manager there's so many problems that range with right now it will be interesting to see what the attendance is against fcsb on thursday Rangers now have seven games in 21 days it's a big period for them and it's a big period for clemont report by lana macai evening times sport october 22 stave and mcginne on promising st millon prospects reported by david irvin steven mcginne is one of the few coaches in scottish football who are actively trying to lose their best players the st mill under 18 manager is desperate to see his top performers unavailable due to first team duty in evan mooney and calum pennman mcginne has two rising talents seemingly close to breaking into the first team environment having already been involved in matchday squads and reckley training with the top team at ralston mooney just 16 made his first team debut on saturday's four nothing defeat to hearts at timecastle in the latest display of the pathway in paisley last night mcginnes side thrashed caledonian braves ate nothing in a scottish youth cup tie played at paisley as steven robinson assistant brian care and academy director ala mcmanus watched on mcginnes is setting the proactive approach from the first team backroom staff will help further motivate his players especially after mooney's debut and pennman featuring on the bench and he said ultimately we don't want to have them if we lose evan to the first team then great evan obviously made his debut at 16 year old we are really proud of him at the academy he worked hard and he gave apart from obviously the score line wasn't ideal but he gave everyone at the academy the boys on sunday were so buzzing to see him and hopefully it's not he goes on to have a real good st murin career the manager and keith lastly great they're both very proactive to get the games here they come and support they keep a keen eye on the boys and it's just a reminder that they are competing evan getting an appearance they are competing with the first team for places and the manager will put them in we are really proud of evan we are delighted for him it just shows you the level he's at that he's able to make premier debut at 16 i've been there myself where you'd be on the bench week after week obviously evan's parents didn't go through with the game against hearts because i don't think they even expected him to be on the bench so it's just being patient and just be ready you never know when your time is and i'm pleased for him it was a bad day for the football club in terms of result and performance but a huge boost for the academy another standout performer in the youth ranks has been stewin thompson the 16 year old teenager son of st murin legend steven thompson leapt to his feet in celebration as thompson jr netted the opener in paisley mcginn knows there is an expectation attached to the surname in paisley and admits thompson will have to cope with the inevitable excitement surrounding his development as the son of a fan favorite however mcginn has insisted the father and son are very different on the pitch despite both playing up front it's something he's going to have to deal with with his surname he said of thompson who has been with the first team matchday squad and spoofing with robinson albeit he is yet to feature his dad's a legend here they're so different stewin can't hit the ball like his dad and his dad can't put it in the top corner with his bad foot we appreciate the name he was an amazing player here and so popular so something stewin is going to have to deal with report by david irvin evening times sport october 23 commonwealth games could be scaled back if cost rise report by stewart paterson the commonwealth games will be scaled back even further rather than any public money be spent on hosting the event the first minister has said john swinney said he expected the games would be within budget but gave the commitment it would not cost the taxpayer should there be any extra cost between now and 2026 swinney joined officials from the commonwealth games and the uk government for the official launch yesterday as the host of the 26 games was named as glasgow the city has stepped in to save the games after victoria in australia pulled out due to the event being unaffordable the first minister said he had to be assured there would be enough time to deliver the games and the scale back event could be delivered at no extra cost to the scottish government he confirmed the budget of 100 million pounds and a contingency of 24 million pounds john doig of commonwealth games scotland said we have got huge confidence in glasgow as a place to hold the games swinney added what we managed to negotiate was the substantial investment from the commonwealth games federation of about 100 million pound a contingency of about 24 million pounds which will be drawn on should that be necessary but then also a commitment that if all of that is not sufficient then the games program has got to be reduced so that there's no call on the public purse ian murray scottish secretary repeated the commitment that the budget was finite and said i am confident there will not be any public money i am confident it can be delivered within that envelope there is no public money available both murray and swinney said the city would benefit from hosting the games whereas in 2014 the games provided the emirates arena housing at the athletes village in del manak and also the hydro was completed in time to be used this time no new venues or infrastructure will be delivered and swinney added i think there will be two particular benefits one will be there will be an enhancement of a number of the sporting facilities in the city of glasgow as a consequence of the investment that is coming in from the commonwealth games federation and secondly there is the opportunity for a major sporting event to be right here in the heart of the city in scotland where individuals can spectate and view and observe all of these and all of that i think helped more and more people to be involved in sport and in the enhancement of their own well-being murray said there's infrastructure obviously going to be put in place to make sure that the stadium is going to be up to scratch and the spectators will absolutely love it so this should be a really exciting opportunity for glasgow in scotland to take it forward evening times sport october 23 the european leeway that seltec have never afforded reported by eun patin brendan rogers insists seltec get no leeway in europe with critics often eager to see the scotland championship champions flop the hoops are in bergamot to face atalanta on matchday three of the champions league they will be doing all they can to prevent a repeat of their last european venture which ended in a seven one mauling at the hands of barusia dorkman insisting he will stick to his beliefs as a coach rogers clapped back at those who have criticized his approach on the continent the 51 year old said we are looking forward to the experience again we've played two games now the first one the five one sloven british slava win you come off and you feel absolutely amazing it's a great feeling then you come off after the second game and it feels like an assault on your spirit but that's life at this level we are really looking forward to the challenge playing against a really good team i started coaching many many years ago over 25 years ago and from the very beginning my coaching has always been aggressive and until the day i finish it will be aggressive that's how i work but i'm also respectful that you play against teams at a certain level and certain opponents where you have to really look at their strengths but i don't tell them not to do that in every game because i do no matter what team i'm playing whether it's in scotland or in the champions league it's the level at which you can get punished so i think it's one where you have to have the balance in your game i think if you look at this club here in atalanta it's a great example obviously they have totally different resources they are way above us in terms of that but if you look at the actual principle of it they came through and arrived at this level i'm sure the manager will tell you that they had some really harsh learning experiences in terms of the games that they played especially against the top Premier League teams it was a real real challenge and the score lines were difficult for them but then they come away and they learn from that and pretty sure and stick with the philosophy but still look at certain areas where they can be better and improved and of course then you become better with that so if you're talking about a pragmatic coach it's a different coach i'm a different person and that's not to say that we go into the game and just be all out at attack all out front foot that's not how it is but if a coach's DNA is to sit back and be that then that's not me and it won't be it's as simple as that my idea is to have an attacking philosophy which is about defending and defending well defending when you have not got the ball being really aggressive and really strong in closing spaces and then when you have the ball look to create opportunities but that's not to say i don't respect the different levels in the game because i absolutely do but i'll always be mindful of having a balance in both attack and defense i think that if you get any sort of common sense and logic you would see that but it's something that doesn't count you don't get the leeway that's the reality of it it's an opportunity for people to beat you over the head with a stick and that's clear so i'm not going to get too emotional about it i don't listen too much it's a perfect storm for some people i can't change that i'm not even going to be bothered to try to be honest there's no leeway given so we just have to concentrate on our own club keep trying to improve and see where he it takes us evening times sport october 23 ryan kent transfer latest report by david irvin former rangers winger ryan kent could choose to stay abroad in the search for his new club according to a report the 27 year old former ibrox forward is on the

scotland the squad were due to leave Bucharest at 11am this morning ahead of thursday night's europea league clash at eyebrows but their schedule flight which was delayed until 1pm has not appeared with the game schedule for 8pm on thursday night it leaves the Romanian league at one side scrambling to organize a charter to get them to glasgow meanwhile a former rangers star has predicted more pain for the iberts club in that europea league clash dorian golin admitted he has been unimpressed with the iberts side and has backed romanian countryman stowa bucarrest to take at least a point tomorrow night from iberts rangers face the former european cup holders in the europea league in what will be their third game in the new luke format after a win at malmo and a home defeat to leon golin who played for rangers for just over a year in 2011 and even played two games in the south division before eventually leaving the club has backed stowa to pile on the pain for philippe clemol he said i saw the rangers match at calmangok at weekend they did not impress me at all i thought they were very predictable when they attacked and nothing they did surprised me stowa are in good form the players are in good morale and just one adabby match in my view they will get at least a point at iberts they will be motivated because the game is at iberts and they will enjoy playing there i think they will be relaxed and i believe they will play an extremely good game and get a positive result iberts is a very beautiful stadium the fans sing they support their team but they've started a play without fear and have plenty of possession which i think will happen it will silence the rangers fans i have been very impressed with daniel beligheia he is in great shape and scores a lot of goals he's a player who is on the crest of a wave the only disappointment is that darry is all our cannot play because he is suspended and he is a big loss evening times spot october 23 rangers to face romanian louis suarez is rangers will face the romanian louis suarez tomorrow night when they come up against daniel beligheia according to stowa bukarest owner the iberts club welcomed the romanian side for the third game of the europea league and their favorites to get a much needed win for under pressure boss philippe clemang but they will have to watch out for romanian international striker beligheia who has netted four goals in his last five games including in both europea league matches and against daniel bukarest in the darby at the weekend and according to outspoken president and owner cisa becali he is very similar to the former liverpool basalona and atletico madrid legend suarez who is still going strong for inter miami at the age of 37 becali said he's 23 years old once he reaches 25 he will be as good as suarez he's that kind of player and very similar to how suarez plays i have already put a 15 million pound release clause on him to be honest when we brought him in from cluj i couldn't believe we got him for two million pound i was expecting to pay eight million pound or so but leagheia impressed me at cluj he ran until exhaustion someone passed to him and he said he couldn't do anything because he was so tired but he still took it and managed to beat his opponent but i didn't know he was so great he amazes me i thought it was good but not like that he scores match after match he runs he presses he's aggressive and then when he gets the ball he scores we have never had a striker like him at stour report by mark walker evening times sport october 24 seltec have earned money with that atalanta draw reported by david irvin seltec have banked a champions league bonus for their hat fought draw against atalanta brendan roger's side were resolutely in defense as they battled to a goalless draw in italy in doing so seltec earned a bonus payment from uefa with clubs rewarded for wins and draws in the league phase of the competition already seltec have banked 18.62 million euros 15.7 million pound simply from being involved in the league phase of the champions league however they added another 700 000 euros 590 000 pound to the bank balance last evening by a draw against atalanta that's on top of the 2.1 million euros 1.77 million pound they earned for their victory over sloven brattislava last month it takes seltec's uefa earnings from the competition so far to around 21.5 million euros 17.94 million pound beyond per match win or draw fees seltec will also be guaranteed another payment from uefa of 275 000 euros 232 000 pound minimum the club finishing 36 in the league phase will earn that figure with another 275 000 euros added for every position higher in the table after all eight matches meanwhile what do seltec need to do to qualify for the champions league knockouts the scottish premiership champions are up to four points in the new look league phase of uefa's top club competition falling that goal with stalemate in bergamot it was a marked improvement from brendan rogers and his team for an away tie in europe especially given the 7-1 hammering dished out by barossi adortment last time out the result places the hoops in a tasty position with five league phase ties remaining with the next two at home to arby leipzig and club bruge and according to scottland's coefficient on social media site x seltec are just two victories away from qualifying for the highly sought after knockout rounds writing on the site the account posted well that was unexpected a fantastic result for seltec the goal is draw away to atalanta puts them on four points in the champions league table after three games two more wins from the remaining five games will now secure qualification the next two are at home against leipzig and bruge followed by zagreb away then young boys at home the end of campaign at villa park at the end of january 0.2 points added to scottland's coefficient taking season total to 3.6 points and another 700 000 euros added to seltec's prize money taking their earnings to almost 35 million euros before ticket sales it was their first away clean sheet in the champions league in seven years when rogers seltec finished third in the group behind psg and bayern munich after a three nothing win over andalec in 2017 so another two wins would see the hoops finish the league phase on 10 points at the very least it will guarantee them a playoff spot but all connected to the club will be hopeful it secures automatic passage to the next round report by eun peton evening times sport october 24 migregors dorkmond and madrid comparison report by joe donnelly mcgregor was delighted with seltec's hard fought goalless draw against atalanta in italy last night and hailed his teammates bravery in the face of a top opponent the serri aside clenched last season's uefa europea league and while the seltec captain said he and his peers had put the disappointment of matchday two's seven one loss to borosu dorkmond out of their heads he did admit there could have been a lingering fear going into this game there wasn't and while speaking to the bbc the 31 year old used dormonds five two loss against real madrid this week when dormond conceded five second half goals to illustrate the high standard europe's flagship competition demands when you take a heavy defeat you can speak your way through it but then when you get onto the pitch you still got that fear a little bit from what happened previously but that was totally gone and the performers was much more like us and hopefully dormond was an off night a lot of things went against us that night and you can even see in the competition dormond lose five goals in one half as well and that's just the level that you're playing at and it punishes you so quickly but to come here tonight off the back of that the players were so brave in terms of the work against the ball and good spells with the ball as well maybe that little bit extra was missing but hopefully that will come in time as well meanwhile an atlanta ace singled out a seltec star who he reckons changed the game in italy mario pasalic reckons seltec keeper kasper smichel saved them from champions league defeat the Croatian star believed seltec should be grateful to their veteran danish keeper and said we had several chances but we came up against kasper smichel and unfortunately we could not break his resistance we have to accept this draw even if it is a bit frustrating we defended very well without taking any big risks the positive aspect is that for the consecutive game we did not concede this is a good starting point if we had scored however the game would have changed completely there were plenty of chances for us but sometimes the ball just does not want to go in it was one of those nights and brazilian playmaker ederson insisted they dominated the game and said sometimes it happens that you dominate the match without managing to score there are games in which you do less and you win we played well of course we are disappointed not to score but the point is important evening times sport october 24 scotsman law set for final offensive in battle to save world tour card report by nick roger in his scrap for dp world tour survival david law certainly has the stomach for the fight i started off in a mexican restaurant but after the starter i wasn't that keen on it so i jumped into the indian for a chicken tikka reported the abadonian of his pre tournament feast ahead of the genesis championship in south korea i am well fed it's not just an army that marches on its belly golfers tend to consume the kind of vast quantities that would sustain napoleon's legions in the far east this week law is preparing to plunge into battle one last time as he looks to safeguard his full playing privileges in the final regular event of the 2024 season for those hovering in or around 114th place on the race to dubai rankings that's the current card retaining safety zone the tension will be so great the greenkeepers at the jack nicklars golf club will probably have to blast nibbled fingernails off the putting surfaces with a leaf blower law at 130th on the order of merit needs a good week to preserve his place at the top table without a top 10 all season the 33 year old could do with throwing one in the here in the last chance saloon i've never been in this position before and i don't want to be in it again said law who has enjoyed six unbroken campaigns on the main circuit it is very uncomfortable you look at the rankings in the summer and you sometimes think i'll be okay by the end of the season before you know it events are running out and lo and behold you're not okay whatever happens i am looking forward to next week because it will be all over there will be a release and there will be clarity the feeling of not knowing is a big part of the pressure having made the cut in his last four events he missed 13 of his first 20 law has traveled to south korea in decent fatal and he added i've chipped away to give myself hope this is my seventh week in a row that's probably four more than i usually do but the situation i'm in has forced me to play more next week i will crash and burn but just now i feel fresh and motivated as ever in this game there are what ifs and if onlys at the start of october law was just one shot off the halfway lead in the hugely lucrative dunhill links championship and was on course to seal his card with a meaty check a weekend of toil though saw him slither down into 64th i didn't play well at all in the third round he reflected of a week on home soil that promised so much when you're right in the mix and have a day that knocks you out it's hard to get going again on the sunday law enjoyed his best season on the tour in 2022 when he finished 49th on the rankings you cannot afford to rest on your laurels at this level but laws pursuit of more distance to keep pace with the big hitters would ultimately leave him easing behind coming off the back of my best season i was thinking how do i get better i made the decisions to try to find a bit more length of the tea and i regret it now last season was nowhere near as good as i hope and this one has been worse changing what i was doing with the driver affecting my iron plate that was my strength but it became a weakness i became too shallow with my irons and struggled to control my distance i went from something like 60th in strokes gained off the tea to 15th but my iron plate saw me drop from 35th to 140th the reason i'm good at golf is my approach play when you lose that the game becomes very difficult there's always a risk involved when you change things and yes i regret it now i was doing it to become a

october 24 keeper smichael happy to be unlikely Celtic creator report by eun pateen casper smichael was happy to help be the creator for Celtic as they earned a valuable champions league point last night the veteran goalkeeper kept a clean sheet in bergamot as the scottish premiership champions left italy with a hard fought goalless draw while keeping atalanta's attackers at bay was of utmost importance to the danish international smichael also saw plenty of the ball in the champions league tie and the 37 year old admits it's something he and the team have been working on the former premier league winner said it was a tough game we knew it was going to be a tough game coming here so we knew that we had to learn from the dirt moon game and we had to defend for our lives and we did that very proud of the boys i think it was an incredible defensive performance when we did have the ball we did carve out some chances but it's always going to be tough against atalanta i think they're the highest scoring team in europe at the moment or at least in intel union football so to come here and get a point i think it is a good point obviously we took a little bit more practical approach in this one where we took a few less chances in the build up because of their system their man-to-man system we tried to exploit that a couple of times it worked but it's always going to be difficult coming away from home in europe against a system that's so aggressive but i think we did all right i think particularly when you play a team that plays man for man like they do i'm always going to be the spare man when we are in possession so it is important that we try and create spaces we try and create openings and that's obviously going to be me on the ball a lot of the time and as soon as someone jumps onto me there's going to be a spare man somewhere so it puts a lot of emphasis on the keeper to try and be creative with the ball it works sometimes it doesn't always work but it's one of those things as a keeper you've got to try and see solutions find solutions be creative and see if you can get out of that for us report by unpatent evening times sport October 24 R.B.

kept him out for a year in a 3-1 win two years ago and the 34 year old warned his teammates what to expect in Glasgow he said it will not be easy at Celtic we know what the atmosphere is like there it's difficult for an away team to survive but our goal was to get the three points in two weeks we didn't get off to a good start we have had three difficult opponents but if you look at the games we could certainly have taken a few points his RB Leipzig skipper and counterman Will Orban Will Orban admits they are struggling to find forum ahead of their trip to Glasgow and said at the moment we are lacking consistency in both penalty areas and that has cost us the win against a top team like Liverpool in attack not only was there a lack of penetration but also a lack of self-confidence the good thing is that you still have five games left you can still achieve anything it's starting to get a bit unlikely for direct qualification but we can still get into the playoffs and that's what we want to achieve of course we're not satisfied with the three defeats but we are currently lacking a little something to beat the top opponents report by Mark Walker evening times sport October 24 reason why Celtic wear different kit sponsors in Europe report by Joe Donnelly Celtic impressed with a hard fought goalless draw against Atalanta in Italy last night with a brave display that better reflected the standards Britain Roger seeks in Europe with the park head side now sitting 20th out of 36 in the new format UEFA Champions League with five games remaining the football on display was not the only familiar sight on a foreign pitch the sponsor on the front of the Celtic shirt was once again the Celtic football club foundation as has become the norm away from home in European competition over the last several years the club's default sponsor betting agency daffa bet was dropped in favor of the club's charitable arm but why is this the case simply betting sponsors are banned in certain countries including Italy where Celtic played last night with the ban having been introduced in 2019 the yellow and green awake it Celtic wore when overcoming Latio in the UEFA Europa League that same year was given the same treatment with the same ban introduced in Spain in 2021 Celtic adopted the same strategy against real Madrid and a clinical Madrid on recent trips England is said to roll out the same ban in 2026 however Scotland as yet has no such plans similar bands apply in other European countries in relation to alcohol brand sponsors which once saw Celtic's previous sponsor Tenants Lager switched out for Tipper area mineral water both owned by Irish multinational company C&C group the hoops swapped from tenants to Tipper area in 2013 having swapped to the Celtic foundation away from home in Europe in recent years by mandate Celtic appeared to have adopted the switch on a universal basis regardless of the country travel to report by Joe Donnelly evening times sport October 24 Rogers calls out Celtic critics report by David Irwin Brendan Rogers called out his Celtic Champions League critics as he delivered a pragmatic one liner after taking a draw against Atalanta Celtic battled to the goalless draw against the Europa League champions in Bergamo with Rogers side rock solid in their defending Rogers had come under criticism for his tactics after the heavy 7-1 defeat to Borussia Dortmund last time out in the Champions League and the Celtic boss has not forgotten the scaling verdict from some commentators on his selection in Dortmund as he referenced his side being pragmatic enough in his post match media conference Rogers said it gives them the confidence that you can defend against a top team I'm not sure if that was pragmatic enough for people tonight I don't know we go out in every game to be structured and defend well you don't want to get pushed back I think the confidence it gives you when you can defend against the very best team that level and that concentration it will give them a huge boost it felt great he added of a first clean sheet for Celtic in the competition in seven years we said before the game we knew the level that we were playing against we are playing against a team that has the highest goal scores in the Italian football and is one of the favorites for this competition I thought the courage the dignity of what the players played with to stand up to the fight and right to the very end so to come here and keep a clean sheet it was a brilliant defensive performance I felt we also carried a threat when we had the ball I think our inexperience at this level shows us sometimes we're a bit hurried with the ball and we give away a little bit too cheaply but that comes step by step but to come away to Atalanta a team of this level and to have that concentration and play with that commitment I was very pleased reports by David Irvin evening times sport October 25 local Bergamo

immediately pledged to drop almost half his team for their weekend derby the Romanians were easily defeated by Philippe Clamont team at Iverox in a one-sided four-nothing win for the Scottish side their second win out of three in the New Luke Europa League outspoken Stoya owner and president Vekali's mind game backfired badly after he put pressure on Clamont before the game by publicly asking how smart the Belgian boss was and promising to I'm promising to play a weekend team but he was far from happy at his side's capitulation in Glasgow and has vowed to make changes for their derby against rapid Bucharest this weekend he said in Europe if you constantly lose the ball you lose a goal Malcolm Eggioma was dreaming for their first goal Maria Stefanescu, Louis Philippe and Baba Alhassan all were poor these players must understand they were not playing chiaccia in Romania here against Rangers if you pass the ball and lose it goodbye when you play a team that is better physically you have to be better technically but even if you're technically better if you don't pass it the right moment and lose possession all the time then what happens is you concede lots of goals I can promise against rapid the team will be completely different you won't see a Juma Alhassan, Stefanescu, Philippe or Alexandru Pantia what am I supposed to say after that you think I am happy to go to Glasgow and eat shit like that meanwhile a former top FIFA referee says Rangers Europa official made two errors in a cut-off goal FIFA referee Marius Abram reckons Italian whistler Marco di Bello made two mistakes when he disallowed Stouer Bucharest opening strike for a foul on Rangers keeper Jack Butland Rangers nearly got off to the worst possible start in that Europa lead tie when the English keeper was caught on the ball by Stouer Stark David Michalowski who then tapped it into an empty net after just two minutes of the game but di Bello who booked seven players at Ibrox immediately blew for a foul so Vaar could not check the incident and the goal was disallowed with Rangers going on to romp to afford nothing success Romanian ex World Cup referee Avram reckons the referee made two huge mistakes and he pointed out it's clearly not a foul and he cancelled the possibility of Vaar analysis by blowing the whistle before the ball went into the goal Vaar protocol says you have to delay the whistle so it was a double mistake if they had followed the Vaar protocol and delayed the whistle I'm certain the decision would have been overturned and the goal would have

strange walk off report by Matthew Lindsay Philip Clemong has explained the reason that emotional ranger striker serial the stairs walked off the pitch during the Europa League win over fcsb last night but insisted the player will learn from the strange incident the Nigerian international left the field and walked up the tunnel due to a problem with his eye in the second half of the emphatic four nothing triumph over the Romanian champions at iBrooks it took some time for Hamza Igamani who completed the victory over the under strength visitors with his first goal for the Glasgow Giants to replace his fellow forward and Clemong grew increasingly agitated in his technical area as the substitute got ready however the Belgian revealed that the stairs had been upset that he was not able to continue up front due to his injury and had made his way straight down the tunnel into the dressing room said Clemong serial got a knock or a finger in his eye or something in his eye so he lost sight he could not see good anymore he was quite emotional about it because he wanted to stay on the pitch but he didn't see anything so he ran off the pitch that was a really strange moment for me but he apologized after the game it's better than to sit down and give time for your teammate to come in but it was in the emotion of wanting to win wanting to react wanting to play well what he was doing also in the game i have no problems with that but it's a good lesson also for this young squad in that way to take every moment in a really professional way i don't remember it happening before to be honest but Cyril is somebody who has such a big passion for this club he wants to give everything every day in training every game in that way he felt he was really good in the game and he was and it's hard to come off and as a player you can have an emotional moment they're human beings he will learn out of that he learned already out of that because he came straight after the game towards me to talk about that i think there's nobody in this room who never had an emotional moment in his life so Cyril had it luckily for him all the cameras are on top of him at that moment so nothing done there i hope we can get him fit for sunday when we place st. mern rangers playmaker tom lorns failed to reappear for the second half of the league phase game and his place was taken by mohammed
