 Hello everyone, welcome back to Nerdist in the Venture and Sports podcast. I'm Rafi, joined by Davion. Davion, it has been a wild week. We finally got the big game that we've been waiting on for so long, Georgia, Texas, so we'll be for sure talking about that later on in the show. But Davion, I know you're probably doing great. I'm doing less ideal because, and I think these are kind of related to the two. Davion, how are you doing? Well, let me just say this. The Rangers are doing great. The Patriots are rebuilding, which is okay. But the Yankees, man, the Yankees. Rafi, what did I say? What did I say? No, no, the Yankees are making it a world series. What do you gotta say now? What do you gotta say now? Yeah, you got nothing to say. That's why I thought Juan Soto, judge, this team is bringing home the pennant. Gonna get a championship back in New York, and I'm so hype about that. Don't get me wrong. This could be a great world series. I mean, the Dodgers are an amazing team as well, but it's the Yankees, man. You know, you wanted the best part about that. You cut out from the first part. So whatever you said, I had no idea what you said. I just heard the last part. So I got spared, I guess. We'll see what happens in post and see what you had to say. But anyways, what were you saying? Yeah, but I mean, Rafi, the Blackhawks are in two and four. Do you have anything to say about that? Not really. Unlike your wild takes on the Patriots, I had realistic expectations for my favorite team, the Chicago Blackhawks. They knew that it was going to be another year likely picking the top five. Offense needs to get clicking a little bit more, but you know what? The talent, we're slowly building up. I really like where we're at offensively, defensively. We looked like a hockey team. The last two years, I couldn't say that about the Blackhawks, which was really sad and upsetting to watch. Now, literally, I cannot watch them because the new Chicago sports network featuring the Bulls, White Sox and Blackhawks is not on YouTube TV, which is ridiculous. But Ryan's Dwarf is going to Ryan's Dwarf. I don't know why the Blackhawks decided to partner with him in this stupid thing, but it is what it is. Most people can't even watch the Blackhawks. And honestly, at this point, I don't think most people want to watch the Blackhawks still, because unless you're a die or like me, who is now sailing the seas, per se, potentially can't confirm nor deny, most people, I think, are just tuned out right now because Blackhawks aren't very good. And overall, too, like, why are you going to go out of your way to buy an antenna, et cetera, to watch the Bulls, Blackhawks or White Sox right now? None of those three teams are particularly good if you're a casual Chicago sports fan. So Blackhawks are fine. They're on the right track, but yeah, they're definitely bound for another top five pick this year. Let's get into the big thing, which is starting in 20 minutes as we're recording this podcast at around 6.30, 6.45 PM central time on Friday. And that's the World Series. David, you indicated it. The Yankees made it to the World Series, we're playing the Dodgers. Now, this was very predictable. I wanted to change things up. And I also, this was like a dread from it run from it. You're getting a Yankees Dodgers World Series, especially after last year or two, where the viewership was terrible. And I'm sure the MLB, the higher up people in MLB were not happy at all with the fact that we had Diamondbacks for Serangers. Again, very low viewed, not too many people cared. I watched most of those games. I think I watched all of them. But for like a casual sports fan, no one wanted to watch that World Series. And I don't blame them because it was two smaller market teams. And although there are great stories, both teams were great and it went six games. No one really cared too much to watch it. If you were just like, Oh, let me see what's on this year. However, man, the Cowboys and Lakers fans must be so like, who do I pick? Do I pick my, my favorite team, my one A in the Dodgers or do I pick my one B in the Yankees? Who do I choose? They're going to be happy regardless. But you have, you went from two small market teams to, I'll follow what it is, the two biggest markets, the two biggest teams arguably, not even arguably in the entire MLB playing against each other and clashing it out. The Yankees haven't made a World Series since 2009. I've really enjoyed that time. I hope that they lose this World Series. And you have the Dodgers who last won the World Series in 2020, but that was in the 60 game short and season. A lot of people call that, well, it's a Mickey Mouse title. I use the same logic with the Lakers. So I just applied to the Dodgers too. So this will be interesting. And yeah, get it. If you're the MLB, this is two massive markets. People are going to tune in in general because it's the Dodgers versus the Yankees. You have all stars on both sides. And this is going to be a great series. I once again hope the Yankees lose, but I also hope that it goes at least seven games for sure, because I want to see the best players and these two teams do have the best players as much as I'd like to see them fall in their face over the past decade. Yeah, I kind of agree with that. I mean, I think, you know, in terms of who has it better set off to be a dynasty, I think in some ways, I mean, you just kind of mentioned started to go into that as much as I'm a Yankees fan, the Dodgers haven't more figured out because they have these guys right under long term contracts. And for the Yankees, we don't know if Glaber is going to go anywhere. We don't know where if Juan Soto stays. Right. And you know what? Money talks. And I don't know if they'll be able to provide money for all of those guys. And it would definitely be like a concern, but that also motivates the Yankees more to win now because of that situation that they're in because Juan Soto is a free agent after this year because Glaber tours might be leaving, you know, and I think that's what makes it such an exciting, such an exciting World Series because both teams have been always predicted to go all the way, but they never have. And for years and years and years, they keep falling short. And now both teams have a chance to really, you know, show that they're the kings of baseball and with, you know, the young talent and they're exciting to watch. I mean, Yankees baseball is always, you know, the, you know, the bomb, the Yankee bombers, you know, it's like, you know, I feel like it speaks for itself in some ways, but yeah, I'm really excited for, you know, Yankees, you know, Yankees Dodgers World Series. All right. I mean, let's talk about Georgia Texas. I mean, like what a game for stuff. Also, since when can fans all of a sudden change the call middle of a game? I mean, like, look, I'm a passionate fan, right? I mean, here at Cornell Hockey, we love to, you know, rile up the refs. But to throw bottles on the field and then somehow get the call reversed. I mean, some shady stuff happened there. Well, hey, well, I mean, Georgia is the team to beat. I mean, this team, like, look, I'm not the biggest fan of Carson Beck, but they showed off, they showed up and, you know, unless Vandy does something and pulls some crazy things off, Georgia, Georgia is really, really good. I have no other way of putting it, Rafi. What are your thoughts on the game? Yeah, obviously, that was a big swing where we thought we had it one way. And then obviously the refs protested and then we wound up getting that pick. Now, Texas wasn't able to really do much with that momentum. I don't think I think that was a drive that they killed off that Georgia's defense was able to defend. And I didn't watch the first half, but 23 nothing Georgia. I did see that Arch Manning did come in for a little bit, because when yours was certainly struggling a lot. And this was one of those games, too, that was concerning if I was a valuelain, Quinn, or yours, Draftsak, because I don't know. Like he was acting very rattled. He was very paranoid from the highlights that I was watching before he got started out for Arch Manning. And it's like you're playing at home. You're this isn't an away game for a short. If it was a way game for Georgia, like I'd be like, OK, like Carson Beck for his Alabama a couple of weeks ago was completely just like out of it for the first half, and then he came back, etc. Quinn, yours, you're playing at Texas. I don't know why he like he just did not seem ready to go from the get go. He did come back in later on, but two touchdowns, one pick. He was solid in the second half. They just weren't able to dig themselves out of the hole. It was a pretty kind of a similar strip to Georgia, Alabama, a couple of weeks ago, where one team gets out to a big lead in the first half. And then the other team kind of tries to come back a little bit, but comes up too short. Texas, I think they again, they could have done more with that momentum. Obviously, the rest were able to or the rest turned back overturned that call after. I don't think necessarily the fans were were like, we're going to like hurt or like affect the officiate the rest and the rest will. Oh, we have to change this call. I think it was more of they just allowed more time because of the lay and then the call got reversed and it was the right. They wound up making the right call. It was definitely an intersection for Texas. But it was disappointing to see how Texas really like they got it to a one square game. But Georgia then was like, OK, we're closing this out. We're not letting Texas take this game over. We're not letting them get the momentum and their defense at a great job of suppressing Texas and ensuring that Texas wasn't able to complete a drive. Because they were they had a couple of drives that they've made good progress on. But Georgia would just close the door on fourth down to say, no, you're not getting any points here. And that wound up being the big difference in this game. Georgia now jumps up to the number two team in the country where they're now right behind Oregon, who Oregon the Ohio State also very recently, too. So now Oregon's number one team undefeated. Penn State is playing Ohio State next week, not this upcoming weekend. So that's going to be a big game as well. But I think we have in my mind right now, and then we'll get into another team as well, too. This year with the 12th team playoff, I think is if there's any year to do a 12 team playoff, I really think it's this year because I honestly don't really know who is the best team in college football. I think there's a couple of teams that I kind of have at the top where I'm like, OK, Georgia, Texas, Oregon, still Ohio State. Those are like my big four. But you also have like the Penn States. You have the Miami. Miami's struggled a little bit and they've had some top games, too. They almost lost to Virginia Tech a couple of weeks ago. They've had a rough go of it. Starting games, they Louisville came back last weekend as well, made it a really close game, much closer than it should have been with Miami getting out to a big lead. Tennessee, obviously being Alabama recently, they've been really good. So I think this year we're going to see we might see some more upsets and we might see some more interesting matchups in this college football playoff. And again, like shout out to teams. We might see some fun teams, too. Like Iowa State might get in from out of the big 12th. We might see Indiana get in potentially as a non like they're not going to win the big 10, but they could still jump in and just fully summarize and conclude this argument that I've been to. Not a real argument, but point out I'm making. Think goodness that we ditched the stupid east, west, north, south, all that dumb, like divisions. Because now it's just like the two best teams. Whoever the two top teams in the conference play during the conference championship makes things much nicer. Trust me, like as a big 10, like I saw who's from the big 10 like region, it was so frustrating to be like, OK, Ohio State, Penn State, Michigan, State, Michigan, one of those teams. OK, who are you guys playing? Oh, it's Northwestern for the one year. They're good. Oh, it's Iowa and then Iowa gets blown out because they can't keep up offensively. So finally, it's we're doing top two teams in the conference play turn the conference championship game, which I am a massive fan of. I'm very glad that. I haven't been too happy with how regions have shifted or not region based with conferences, but I'm at least happy that the two top teams in the conference will be playing each other in the conference championship game. I think that's that makes sense to me. And then you could potentially get like Michigan, Ohio State again, which would be insane, for example. Yeah, I 100% agree with that. And I want to talk about some other teams that, you know, aren't in the top 12 and probably will really end up there. BYU. I mean, that team is just it's such an interesting team. I mean, such an interesting story. I mean, having your quarter back be not not only not Mormon, but being Jewish. And then, you know, this entire trend starting with BYU, you know, it's quite funny to watch Indiana is one hell of a story. Parma French, but wow, that's a fun. You know, it's just a fun team to watch. They're just a scoring juggernaut. Speaking of scoring juggernauts, Boise State. Look, Boise State may have not had, you know, the hardest schedule out here. But Ash and Jetty is the I don't even know how to explain it. He is so freaking good. I mean, David, is he your husband? David, do you think he's is he your husband? Pick right now? Yeah, I think he is. I think well, well, he's carrying this team. Yeah, I think he's well above everyone. Like I've seen the ESPN poll they put out like once a week where it's like, oh, who's your husband winner and Tim? And then you have like Carson back and you have Miami Square back when blanking on right now, what his name is. But anyways, you have a couple of players. Yeah. And it's like always like 60, 70 percent of the fans are just saying, like, give Jayne to the Heisman because he like you might be like, oh, like, exactly. I mean, it's 1100 yards. OK, that's solid. But then you realize like he's played like a full game of football. Like he's doing minus one games because they've been taking him out because he's blowing out team. Boise State blows out teams in the first half and then they pull. Yeah, if he was playing these games full 60 minutes, his numbers will look even more ridiculous. He'd be well over 1500 yards and all like good, which is just you. Yes, you can make the argument that he's playing in fear, inferior competition. But you got to give props for it. He's putting a video game numbers and CC and you can make the argument there is less competition, but I don't see any other running back in the Big West. Doing anything close to what Jayne is doing this year. It's it's crazy. And like, can we just mention he put a hundred ninety two yards. He rushed a hundred ninety two yards on Oregon, which is, you know, considered, I guess, the best team right now in the cultural. Well, I guess, according to rankings, I mean, this guy is having a Reggie Bush like campaign and the fact is, and the sad fact is, Rafi, we both know he's not going to win the Heisman, right? I mean, it's going to go to some QB. And I don't know who it's going to be, whether it's Carson Beck or when you were or whatnot, but it just sucks. It's really sad to see. You know, I'm going to go. You know, it's great. For all the worst game right now. And you know, like. I'll first crack myself. It was the not the Big West. It was the Mountain West. But yeah, I completely agree because. But I also say to like these quarterbacks haven't been too impressive this year. I haven't been blown away by any of these quarterbacks. And there's no wide receiver putting up the numbers we saw from Devonta Smith when he won the Heisman Marvin Harrison, Jr., when he's been in consideration. Exactly. Yeah. So if there is any year to give it to a non-power five player, like I think this might be the year for Jainty just entirely. And I really hope that we get Boise State as the non-power five, non-power 14 in the college football lab this year. I really hope that they put the Boise State in because then we'll really get an idea of like, OK, Jainty, you're you're ready. I'm not like on in Zorgan, but like, they's another top 10 school in the country. Another solid defense in all that good. And let's see how he does because it's crazy to say that. Like I genuinely think that he's having like a Saquon Barclay type of year. I don't think he's going to go as high as Saquon Barclay did. Obviously, Saquon Barclay went, I think, what second overall in 2017, 2018, whatever year was, but you have to imagine at this point, unless barring like an injury, which nothing would hopefully never happens this year in general, you'd have to imagine he's a lot to be like a top 15 pick potentially. Like again, this is like Bijan Robin. Like, yeah, I mean, it would have to be right. I mean, I feel like there's no other way of going around it. But yeah, I mean, Rafi, this has been some exciting, exciting football. I know I've said it before, but to say it again, you know, college football, it's nothing else. I really like it. Nothing else really like it. We do need to talk about NFL, Rafi. And two is coming back this week. So dolphins should be always somewhat back. The Bonte is on the jets and they still stink. And yeah, I mean, Rafi, how you feeling? I mean, oh, also what a robbery from the from by the refs of the white of the Vikings the other day, sorry, I'm tripping over my words. It's just like so bizarre what happened. You know, like that was a clear face mask call. I don't know how you can't see that either way. I think I think the Vikings coach really handled it well. You know, when he mentioned that, you know, it was clear, clear face mask, but we shouldn't have been in that position to lose the game. And, you know, the Vikings are a very good team. The Rams are a good team. And I hope Sam Donald gets paid very soon or gets paid over this off season because he's been balling also. So it's just from Jefferson, you know. So, you know, that's kind of my review on this past. At least past Thursday night game and, you know, a few other things to mention, but Rafi, you got anything else you want to talk about NFL or anything that you what's like the biggest what team like worries you? I know we talked about this last week, like, you know, like some teams, I really worry you whether they're going to be able to make it in playoffs, you know, a week later, are there any teams you're excited about after what you saw this past week? Yeah, honestly, I'm pretty concerned about the Saints at this point. And I think most people are with the Saints. And I think right now, in my mind, I think the Saints being the Saints, two and a start said more about the Panthers and Cowboys being really displaying this year, being quite bad. More than it was like the Saints offenses, this amazing thing. Oh, the Saints are like amazing. They're such a great team, et cetera. They're leading everything in offense. I think that two things can be true. The Saints are not the team that won those first two games. They're not as good as that team. Those that team points. Yeah. But they're also not as bad as the Buccaneers putting up 51 points on them. And then Givante Williams running for what fell like at least 200 yards on the Saints for not this past Thursday, but the Thursday before in Champagne's revenge game on the Saints. I think that there's a variety of factors. Obviously Derek Hart has been out the past two weeks and Spencer Reller didn't do a terrible job versus Tampa, but obviously you still lost by three touchdowns. Yeah. And then this past game versus the Broncos, he was like, there was nothing. And you also have Rashid Rahid Shahid, who's now out for the year. We got injured in that Tampa game. And then Crystal LaVigat concussed as well in the game versus Tampa very early in that game and missed the Broncos game due to a short week. And then he didn't clear the pressure protocol and Camero every week. It's something new with him. He has a rib injury. He has hand injuries. So he's been also like he hasn't been fully 100%. So I think the injuries have completely derailed them offensively. And Crystal LaVigat is coming back this week. Derek Hart should be back the next week. So they're slowly starting to get more and more healthy. Obviously you're not going to get should eat back unfortunately this year. So I think the Saints, again, they're not as good as they were when they won those two games. They're not as good as we think they thought they were. But they're also I don't think they're as bad as they've been for the past five games. I think they're somewhere in between. But regardless, I think the team's just not a playoff team. Yeah, I think I'm going to agree with you on there. You know, I think that the Jaguars, I think Doug Merone just pushed off another week that he doesn't get fired. This Patriots team, I am going to say I am worried about the Patriots. And the reason why I'm going to say this is what every other sports pun has been saying this past week. You don't call your team soft on national television. I'm sorry. Yes, the team hasn't been playing well. Maybe they haven't been putting enough effort, but you call the team soft in the locker room, not out in the media. And that's why Bill Balachrak, Tom Brady, Julian Ellman have all spoken out against Jared, not Julian Ellman, Devin McCordy have all spoken out against Jared Mayer, because that's not that that's not the Patriot way. And that's just not, you know, just not the Patriot way. That's just not what a coach does. You take accountability. And that's not what he did. He blamed it all on the players. And I just want to say Drake May has been doing amazing. And he is a clearly was a top three pick. And it makes sense. I'm going to run through stats with you real quick, Rob, because look against the Texans, two hundred forty three yards, three touchdowns against the Jaguars, two hundred seventy six yards, two touchdowns. He's going for over 500 yards and five touchdowns in this in the, you know, in all the other games that he's been starting. This guy is playing great for a rookie. And it's just sad that the media came and paid attention to that because we have a stupid head coach who's calling the team soft instead of really addressing it within the locker room. You know, you clearly I'm passionate about this. And the reason why I'm so passionate about it is because as a Patriots fan, I understood that this wasn't going to be the year we go to the Super Bowl. I understood to an extent that we won't be as good as you know, we won't be very good, that we might finish under 500. But what I've been seeing from this Patriots team is just not it. The defense, the defense was amazing last year. We have a defensive minded coach. It's still the same defensive game plan you'd think, but it's just clearly not showing up. The Patriots have a very simple operator, very simple defense. They have that done that for years. And it seems like they can't even execute the simple things right. And I blame that on the coaching, not the players. Very, very passionate rant. And I do think that there's some reasoning to believe, like question the coaching, especially as you said, they return essentially the same players on defense. And it's there's no difference in system. Gerard Mayo has been in the Patriots. He's essentially been like incubated for this season to where the Belichick is believes it was duties. Gerard Mayo, okay, you ready now everything you have everything settled. The only player that they really lost with Matthew Judon and he hasn't really done too much with the Falcons this year from a past perspective. So you can make the argument that with his injury history, etc. Like they didn't really lose too much. And yeah, it's I think the biggest shock to me is just the defense. I agree with you. It's it's been really bad. I think we all expected the Patriots offense and not be good this year. Drake may have stepped in and played really well these past two weeks in his first two games. I don't think he's been insane by all means, but he's been a kickback. He's made a mistake. But you know what? He's been pretty solid. He's I'd say he's played better in his first two games and Kail Williams it in his first two games. So I think he's off to a good start. And you have some pieces you have tomorrow, Douglas, you have also tight end Hunter Henry Rodney Stevenson is a guy who shows up some weeks. Doesn't really show up other weeks. That's a whole other thing that we get into. But yeah, that's a whole other thing. I definitely question the coaching. I personally think that it's best just to see it out for the year and see what happens. I personally and this is not coming from a hater perspective. This is a no buys perspective. I think I'd like to at least see two years before I really this because I think people in the NFL, it's such a demanding results business where it's like we need to see results right away. I think you give them next year as well. Give them an off in our off season. If things are still off the rails for the Patriots, then it's a bit of a concern if you get some more, if you get an offensive weapon or two for Drake May, and this is the same result. Then I start to question his coaching as a whole. And yeah, the defense is that's been the back one of the Patriots over the past couple of years, even in the twilight years of Tom Brady's time there. Tom Brady wasn't at the top of this game, but you knew that the Patriots were going to be a top five, 10 defense in the NFL. And we're going to keep similar to what the Steelers are right now. But the Patriots offense was still a little better than what the Steelers offense is. It's definitely some red alarms overall for the new Patriots. And on our team too, Sevegan teams like the Patriots in Tom Brady's final years. The Pittsburgh Steelers let's weld last week versus the Jets. They put on a pretty good performance overall, beating the Jets by what is it, 22 points, three scores. And the Jets were coming off a really bad loss to the Bills. And it wasn't bad in the sense that they got blown out. It was a close loss. But the kicking situation just completely derailed them. They had, they left nine points on the table. The offense wasn't able to really still do much, which set up Greg's airline to keep missing field goals in the first place. And it felt like they kind of let that game get away from them at the end of the day, where they had their chances, but just couldn't capitalize. And you pick up Devante Adams, you expect the team to like, okay, like, yes, the Steelers are a good defense, but you, the Jets that put up 15 points is that's, that's just, you cannot be having that happen to get shut out in the second half. Devante Adams and Gary Wilson were both semi-involved in the offense. Breeze Hall was great for the most part. I think Breeze Hall is probably the biggest winner of the Devante Adams trade, because I think it really opened up his ability to run and as a passing option. But this felt like a big game for the Jets and the Jets just proceeded to, as they've normally done in the past, just Jets it up. And if they, if they somehow lose, no offense, if they somehow lose to the Patriots this weekend, what do you do at that point? You fired the head coach already. You brought in Devante Adams, you made a big swing, you picked up another guy who retread Packers, a tradition. If the Jets lose to the Patriots, then there's serious problems. And the schedule doesn't get any better for the Jets. They have the Texans a week after. So the seasons don't get that long. They play the Cardinals too, which Cardinals have been up and down, but the Cardinals are still good, you might say. Then you play the Colts. Okay, essentially when that game, Seahawks, depends what week you get. Dolphins have Tua. You play the Dolphins actually twice and Tua's back. Hopefully it's healthy. You play the Jaguars, but then you play the Rams and Bills too. If, like the Jets are two and five, like they cannot be afforded to pick up any more losses. And they don't have a luxury of having an easy schedule the rest of the year. And they don't have the luxury of just like coasting. Their defense, you should not be giving up 37 points. I know Russell wasn't in a good game, but you should not be giving up 37 points to the Pittsburgh Steelers. That's completely unacceptable for a team like the Jets with quote unquote Super Bowl aspirations. Yeah. Um, I completely agree with you there, Rafi. And I think I want to switch over to talk about some like hype from some like key games of the week, I think that can really dictate the rest of the season. Uh, first off, um, and that doesn't really dictate the rest of the season, but I think it's big to see, uh, Bears commanders, uh, One versus two. The numbers for two. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you know what David, here, I'll just, I'll just cut you off real quick to mention this game. Yeah. If I'm Dan Quinn, if I'm the commanders, I know Zardyne Gano is in this game. Even if he's, he's been living in practice this week, I personally just, I'm this, you're ready. You're ready. You're playing with cash money. Jen Daniels has been great this year. You have, you have five wins, which I didn't even think they were going to potentially even get to five wins this year. You're right at five wins on the year. Take your time with the rookie quarterback. It's okay. Let him sit out this week. Let Marks, Mario to play. Just he, Marks, Mario to hold it down. It was first to Panthers. Yes. But he did an admiral job. Marks, Mario to, I do not want him playing the rest of the year. He is not that guy, but for another week, I think you can throw him out there versus the Bears and feel semi like, okay, like he could potentially pull off a win here. And the worst thing you can do is a Jane Daniels is not a hundred percent is throwing them right back out there. And if he gets re-injured, God forbid, or something happens, then it's the whole season's completely derailed. So I say you just, you just. Let Jane Daniels, he's been limited all week. Game time decision. Just have him say, you know what? We want you to be fully healthy. We want you to be ready to go. He runs the ball. He runs quite a bit too. So it's just like, stay healthy. Take the week off. We're fully recovered. And then you're all ready for the rest of the year. So I just learned from the past. I'm sorry. Learn from the past. That's all I got to say right now. Yeah. I mean, look, I do agree with the learning from the past. I'm just going to slightly disagree with that. I think you should be an emergency backup. Because I think that, you know, like their schedule is not bad. Don't get me wrong, but because you play the giant, they play the Giants the week after the Steelers, which is a good team, but you have the Steelers, Eagles, Cowboys, you know, the end of the season is also not too bad. I just think that this is an important game, I think for them to really win and really put, you know, a big difference between them and the rest of the NFC East. And so because of that, I really think that he should play maybe like the second half or be very limited in gameplay. But I, you know, agree to disagree. You know, I don't think we could go. I don't think, you know, we need to, you know, argue about that. But another game, I think that should be talked about. There's two of the other games. Colts Texans and Falcons Bucks. Oh, wow. You didn't say the game I was thinking about. Okay. So this will be fun. Really? Okay. Well, let me talk about Falcons Bucks, Buccaneers. And the reason because this game is so important, because you beat the Buccaneers, you almost, you don't clinch the division, but you come very, very close to, right? Because the only other threat to the Falcons and the NFC South is the Buccaneers. Right? You beat them here. You mean, that means you swept them this entire season. And then the Falcons got the Cowboys, the Saints, Broncos, all three teams I've been really struggling. And, you know, and then it's kind of smooth cruising after that. I mean, other than the Chargers and Vikings, you know, you end off the season with the Raiders, Giants, Commanders, which, you know, that could be a tough game and the Panthers. So they could, the Falcons could really position themselves well if they win this week. And that's why I think it's a huge game for them in terms of the. Also real quick, just to chime in, they're three and also far into the division. So if they go to four and O, then they're looking really good. And that's been one of the fall season of past Falcons teams, aside from obviously terrible quarterback playing Arthur Smith, deciding to have the backup tight end, like throw a pass on the one yard line. So just giving the ball to Vijon Robinson. Sorry, PTSD. They're winning these conference games. And if that's something that they didn't do in years past, they didn't have a good enough conference record. They'd drop one to the Panthers somehow. The little always split with the Saints. The Buccaneers past years, they were getting like swept by the Bucs too. So to be three and O and potentially to go to four and O, I think that's just absolutely massive for the Falcons to build up that lead on the division, but continue on. Yeah. I think what this quotes, it's a very pivotal game for them. Why? If you don't beat the Texans, Joe Flacco, the Texans have it's Joe Flacco season. That is me. The Texans go two games on above you, right? And then your rest of the season schedule is like, it's not bad, but it's not great either. You play the Vikings, Bills, Lions and Broncos. Beyond that, I mean, yeah, their schedule gets a bit easier because you know, they have the Jets on their schedule, the Patriots, the Giants, the Jags, the Titans. So to an extent, their schedule is fairly easy, but at the same time, you want to win the division, right? And you don't want to really play, you know, be put into a wild card race. And that's why I think this is such a big game for them, for the Colts, for the Texans. I mean, look, same, they're in the same position as the Buccaneers, which I already explained. So those are my highlights of the game of the weeks, like key games to watch. Raffi, what are yours? David, real quick, do you start Jill Flacco this week versus Texans? Because Anthony Richardson was very hyped going through the season. We saw the flashes of the first four games before he got put out for the year. Unfortunately, got injured and was out for the year last year. And there's high expectations. And he has currently three touchdowns, six interceptions, just under 800 yards. He has an a QBR of 43. And I know QBR is in like the biggest. It's not like a directly a quarterback stack and really to the team too. But he has not been good this year. He's having a massive, I guess you can call it a sophomore slump. But I just say it was more like this would be like the midway point of his rookie year. He's played essentially like seven, eight games. He got injured as well this year earlier on. And do you start Joe Flacco in this game? Because Joe Flacco hasn't been bad. And once again, we saw what he did last year, but. You can't just keep rolling out Joe Flacco. Can you? I can't. Well, can I deal with world? Yes, you can continue rolling him out. But at the end of the day, Anthony Richardson won them the game last week. I don't see how you like, yeah, I wasn't pretty against the dolphins, but I don't see how you can bench him really, you know, I think. But it was the coolest toughens and they won 16 to 10. I know, I know. I know. Like it's you can't. You know what it doesn't. That doesn't. After you. You can't. That will kill his like, look, it's the same way you bench Bryce young, like there's you can't do that to a QB. And unless he gets injured or, you know, they say, like, hey, we want you to rest a bit more. I tell the doctors to give him some sort of a note. Other than that, I feel like you need to roll him out. Yes, Joe Flacco played well. We also didn't play amazing. You know, they only put up 20 points on the Titans. Right. So, you know, I feel like, yes, Joe Flacco played fairly well. He did his job, but I can't argue for Anthony Richardson to be benched. I just can't. Very fair. All right. We'll move into the game that I want to talk about in the game. I'm very surprised that you didn't mention Cowboys 49ers. This is a massive game for both teams. And I think. Both teams cannot afford to lose this game. The Niners, especially where it's Christian McCaffrey. Is he going to come back after the buy? That's a big. Everyone's saying he is. I get mixed vibes because we went from, oh, you should be good for week one, two. Oh, he's dealing with a little bit of an injury, too. Oh, yeah, he's going to be out for like the next month. And now it's, oh, yeah, he's going to be back after the buy. So we ramped up really quickly, the like 10 plus weeks for McCaffrey to be out for. And even when he's going to come back, we discussed this last week. He's probably going to be playing mostly receiving in the receiving game. You just lost Brandon IU for the rest of the year. And the rest of the season for the 49ers, they can off if they fall to three and five, they lose this game to Dallas. You not only have to deal with Dallas fans and them pretending their delusion of thinking that they're going to go to the Super Bowl. And then you have the fact that they're going to be happy because the Yankees and Dodgers, one of them is going to win the World Series, which is great for Cowboys fans. But the Niners, the rest of the season is then you have Tampa Bay, Seattle, Green Bay, Buffalo, Chicago, Rams, Dolphins, Lions, Cardinals. Wow, you're right, man. This is the injury. The injuries are ramping up. It destroyed the roster for the 49ers. They cannot lose this game if they go to three and five. That's actually like you can still make playoffs with seven, eight losses. That's the benefit of having a 17 playoff. But if the Niners lose this game, you're injured to heck him back. But like you can't drop this game. This is a must win game for them. And then Cowboys, too. Micah Parsons is out again. Dexter Lawrence isn't playing, so you're still losing. You still are out. You're two top players on defense on the back end. The running game has been like Rico Dalville is kind of in solid. He doesn't make anything special. Zeke and Dalvin Cook. Dalvin Cook, I haven't seen. I don't know what's going on with him. He was brought into the Cowboys, but I don't think he's played even a snap for them. And that press has had a terrible year so far. So if the Cowboys lose this game, you'd have to imagine Mike McCarthy is going to get fired shortly, like at some point, maybe not like immediately, but he's definitely on his way out this year. It's a terrible season for Cowboys. And if the Niners lose this game, then you're already injured. Do you even play with Chris McAfrey? If you drop another game or two, if you drop the next week game before the buy and you go to three and six, do you even play Chris McAfrey this year? Do you just punt on the season? I don't know. I think this is just a this has massive playoff implications, massive job implications. And we're only this is only week eight. But I think this is this will dictate both teams' trajectory for the rest of the year. Yeah, I mean, I agree with that. Yeah, yeah, you're right. I didn't even think about this game. But yeah, this is huge for both teams and it's prime time. So we'll see under the lights and it'll be fun to watch. I think both teams haven't been doing great, but I think both teams can put up a show. You know, so absolutely. And I think that'll do it then for this edition of the Benchro and Sports Podcast.
