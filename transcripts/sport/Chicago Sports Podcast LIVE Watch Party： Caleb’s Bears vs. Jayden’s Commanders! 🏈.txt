We're your boys Brandon trackside and big game James Paul Getting your prime time ready for the Bears critical 325 CVS showdown with the Washington commanders in the showdown of Nations capital big game James There are games during every season where a team finds out what it's made up the witness test if you will is today a game Where opponents will tell us what the 20? 2024 bears are truly made up We're gonna see the bear this is the toughest team the bears are gonna play this job Coming this year so far so What they've got to do is Really make a statement against Washington whether or not they're gonna be contenders or pretenders Caleb's got Caleb's got to be there today. He's got to show up. He's got to play like he has the last three four games Not make mistakes Leave this team You know the defense has to really step up See a game But Also This is a great offense That Yeah, I agree man, it's gonna be a great. This is a great offense the best offense that they've had what's up breaking Bruce We love you man. Thanks for joining the show man. I hope you can hear us loud and clear breaking news Bruce man One of our great moderators out there But yeah, man, give it up for a big game James Paul man doing good job It's the million dollar question that will determine who captures today's game, bro If Jaden Daniels who's a game time decision and he tries to work his way back for a rib injury Who wins the biggest rookie duel of the century Caleb in the Bears coming in a slim two and a half and favorite or Will be Washington Commanders Daniels plays Yeah, I think so too, I think it's gonna be a good game I think it's gonna be a little back and forth and if you will I'm really surprised about Washington because quite honestly when you take like their biggest pass rusher and you put them on the Bears talk about some stooge's Why in that hell would you freakin get rid of your best pass rusher? And give him to the Bears who already have a bona fide really good defense is beyond me. Why would you do that? Why would you do that big game James? They were gonna be in rebuilding mode for a couple years I don't think they were gonna be this good Big impact disease had on the team to lead them to a winning record already so had they known that Daniels was gonna be like this. I don't think they would have been crazy way Sweat to the Bears last year. I'll tell you what man fools gold you guys are fools in Washington for giving us The best freaking pass rusher we've had in a while because it gets right You better have a really super reinforced rip jacket over there because Sweat is coming back and I'm not talking about key sweat. I'm talking about Montez sweat He's coming at your ribs and he's coming in hot We got some baby wreck ribs that he's coming for in Washington and he's gonna snap your neck So get ready you understand J Daniels. We're coming after you pal. I mean, that's what you got to do It's not targeting. It's football. Okay. This ain't powder puff stuff man. This is football. They're glad eaters They're gonna come at you and he's gonna be flinching. He's gonna get ready to throw the ball and he's gonna be like I'm telling them and it's gonna be crazy. You're gonna see some weird stuff out there and there Marcus Mariota he is. I mean, he is what he is. I mean if he was really that good, he'd be a starter You know what I mean? I like our chances buddy. Oh, yeah And you know, here's the thing you look all the way back at Texas Tech Here's a reason why we didn't get any offensive coordinator that You look over there that Washington got there's a reason behind that Texas Tech He started off really strong and then he fizzled out people figured out what he did same thing with Arizona Cardinals He started out strong and they figured out what he really did, you know He just fizzled out and I think he's starting out really strong now with Washington and we're gonna figure it out I mean we look at either was he's got enough Tape on the game and he hasn't played a defense as good as ours, right big game James And I think that's why they're turning them passively keep them out of the game To protect them from getting hitting them ribs Yeah, I mean I'm telling you right now That's the biggest thing of it all is that we are gonna go after that We're gonna come come in early come in hot But what's been the secret to uh Daniel's remarkable 75 percent percentage already through his seven games as an NFL QB what's what is it that he's doing? Magic I don't think I've ever seen anyone that high uh completion percentage as a rookie But uh, I think it's your smart pass and you know smart pass Um Yeah, yeah, I agree. Um, okay, so um, so We've seen Caleb evolve from a shaky rookie Just two months ago against Tennessee in a poise game changer who was thrown for seven scores against just one interception over the last three games Where has he improved the most since his first two NFL games? Yeah He's controlled No, I agree he's he's definitely came on strong and you know, you've seen that in the past Especially when games where he wants to come up, you know, and he wants to show up and I think right now When he's playing when he's playing in Washington where he's from This is a coming home party for him man. This is Montez sweat revenge game. This is huge All over man, and I will say this I think that that is big for him. I think that's big for him to uh To come in and then ride high. We've had three wins. I look for a fourth one, man. I think that's that's very important, you know Yeah, so I mean, you know, here's a deal. Here's a deal. It's a duel Uh, and he's doing against Daniels. What kind of statement are you looking for uh from Caleb to make today? What what do you see him doing? That's all it matters, baby Just win, baby Yep For sure, man. I agree, man. That's that's a simple enough, uh answer It's as easy as it gets commanders linebacker, uh, bobby wagner, maybe 34 But he can still go like an NFL marathon man and you know, honestly What the good thing about him is that he is a field general He's out there that's going to be able to make people smarter around him and that's what it's about It's not about you showing up and showing out and showing everybody that you're the best guy on the field It's about making other people better around you And I think bobby wagner is the guy that can do that and I think between him and people playing For dan quinn, that's what makes these commanders defense very sneaky and that's what i'm looking at right now I mean, how will wagner and the washington defense try to rattle Caleb, uh, what's uh washington's defense enters the game middle of the pack 16th in the league But if you're top notch in offense, that's good enough, right? Yeah What they're trying to do is what the teams did to Caleb in the first couple games which was uh Put a lot of try to come with a lot of pressure Yeah, I think I think there's going to be a lot of a lot of pressure. Hey jimmy league. Thanks for uh showing up, man Thanks for helping us out back there Now I I couldn't agree more man, uh, who will be the x-factor on the bears defense to containing the league's top scorn offense uh Between the defense of land and the linebackers, but I think you'll accept. There's really going to be Edwards and edmonds. I'm going to give it to Just to contain uh the run if they have no plan Edwards and edmonds. Yes, Edwards and edmonds. Well, you know, I I think that could be it I think Edwards and edmonds is going to help out and the thing about it is you got to look at this Take this in consideration When you have two guys in your backfield that are injured Usually there's a big drop off, especially in terms of playing an offense that is high powered like this This is the the very important thing that I want to look at because in terms of For the last few years at least a decade or so maybe even more when I you look at the bears They don't really stack the deck They're they're not like, you know, I look kind of look at it like hockey about one line that comes in two line It comes in three lines, you know And you look at this team and if the bears have a drop off so far It's not very unnoticeable because the way the polls has really built this roster And you know solidified the foundation in a quick three-year span. Oh, yeah, I could believe how quick We think we'll be the X factor receiver for Williams today Do you think that DJ Moore is going to go off and get three touchdowns and 230 plus yards? Or do you think it's going to be Of some of its parts and everybody's going to be able to be Yeah, I think everyone's gonna need I think he's going to spread the ball But I think the one that's going to benefit the most and be the X factors can be keen and Allen See like what last game they were really getting their stride together. So yeah, so I think we're gonna see some more keen and Allen again I mean, seriously the way that I look at it is this keen and Allen is a pro of all pros He can play the X the Y the Z wherever you want him to play He'll line up. He'll show up and show out and he's also a type of guy That's going to make other players better around him and that's kind of what you need in aroma dunce And I think he's even you know helping DJ more out, you know iron sharpens iron or you get exposed, you know Right, absolutely for sure. Um, so I I think that To today, you know, it's it's funny and I talked about this on a few shows I talked about it uh friday with brian earl ocher when he was on the chicago sports podcast show That's right pinch yourself. He was on our show folks It was awesome. Mr. 54 So anyways, um The thing about it is is like I grew up with a big family And my mom was always like she just made sure that all of us understood Hey, when it's time to eat and make sure everybody else gets to eat if you're on your second and third And nobody else's eight then we got a problem because somebody else might be coming up short I think that you know, Caleb Is in the same situation where he's got to make sure everybody eats because he's got a lot of mouths to feed We're not used to like last year when all it was was dj board and he was the only one that Could eat, you know what i'm trying to say. I think he's but now make no mistake about it He could still go off. I mean that means that there's a lot more people on the defense It's kind of covering all those other guys So you're gonna see a lot of single protection out there Sometimes you'll see double but a lot of times, you know, you'll see some single where he can scoop boogie and go off and Make no mistake about it that was Washington commander's defense in the secondary They're like around And they really haven't played anybody Uh that most noticeable I think they're the both more in Tampa, but outside of that they don't play anybody like She comes with their deep voice Hey Debbie Tubble, how you doing out there? Can you hear me, baby? I hope you're doing good. She's uh She was a honey bear man. She we love her man. She's always watching our shows very supportive She said let's go bears. Debbie. I hope you can hear us out there. I hope you're having a good sunday Um, yeah, so when the dust settles around 6 30 tonight or so what will be the story of the day and who will be visiting club? Yeah, I think he's gonna have a good day today. I think a lot of people can have a good day today I think our divas can have a good day today as long as we get pressure Even those second string and third string defensive backs are gonna eat because pressure Will help those defensive backs, right bro Yeah, hey everybody enjoy the game everyone.
