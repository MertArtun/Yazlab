 Ventson Van Gogh, people told him, you can't be a great painter, you only have one ear. You know what he said? I can't hear you. As always, God bless you, you go first. You are now listening to Sip and Sports, a Philly sports talk morning show with Chris, KJ and Dalt, proudly powered by 302 birds. Let's take it to the show. Good morning. Happy Saturday. Welcome to another episode of Sip and Sports. So as we always do, we will give you guys that pre-recording disclosure. We are pre-recording this Friday night, October 25th. So on that Saturday, your Flyers will be playing and we have no clue what the hell is going to happen in the Sixers game. So we'll figure all that out here in a second. But KJ, Chris, how are we doing fellas? Not too bad. Now I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good. I know the Flyers have sucked as of late, but I'm going to my first game. Well, it's, I guess it's today since we're pre-recording. So I'm excited for that. I'm going to see Mitch Kauff's first regular season game. Well, my first time seeing Mitch Kauff regular season. So I'm excited for that. But coming back, I mean, we got back from that. That Eagle was jet, giants. Why am I saying jets? Gain from last week and flying high from that still for sure. That was fun. Yeah. That was a blast. We had the time of our life over there and met live stadium. Chris was there. Adult was there. Jack, it was, it was a great for Gizzle. It was a great freaking time for sure. And we even got to introduce Mikey D to Chris and adult and Jack and everybody. And that was, that was awesome. So I think it was, it was fun to can up on a giant fan. We didn't, we didn't mess with them too much though. So that was a good thing because the Eagles did the rest for us. Yeah. I mean, the game really spoke for itself. Like both of you guys said, which we will react to that here in a second and everything else as we do. But if you guys are in here, be sure to like it up, share it up, all that good stuff. Because when we're pre recording those little things really help. They help us to prevent from coming out slow, like the Philadelphia plot. See, ah, but Chris, I'll let you go ahead and take it first. I mean, I'm going to be there today. I mean, what, what are you looking forward to with the Flyers? What have you not liked with the Flyers? What does this team need to do as a whole? I mean, they're just a really young team. I think that's the biggest thing. I mean, you got a kid who's what you got, you got two guys, one who's 18, one who's 19, um, who are not your, the face of the team, but they're two young building blocks. And it's just a younger team than we've had in years past. And they're going to struggle at times. It's just, it's how it is. Um, I think we got a little bit of a tease with the Flyers last year, the way they were able to come out really hot and, you know, look like they were going to make the playoffs. So, um, it's just, I think we've got to kind of bear in with this team. And yeah, it's going to be a long season. They're not going to be a great team, but you're going to, it's going to be exciting to see these young guys like Mitch Coving. He had a two goal game the one night. Um, and Luchenko who is 18, like barely 18 years old, the youngest flyer to ever play. So it's just, it's a different, um, it's a different season. And it's just going to be a, it's going to be a, in some aspects of long season, because I really don't see them winning that many games this year. Um, I thought it might have been a building block year from last year. They would have snuck into the playoffs, but they got even younger than they were last year. So we'll see how they can continue to roll through this year. But, um, I, my expectations aren't too high. And I think that's what makes it fun is the expectations aren't high. That's well said. I don't think you could have put it a better way there at the end. That's what makes it fun. KJ. Yeah, it should be interesting to see what they got. I mean, obviously right now they are, what are they, they're one in five right now. I'm pretty sure, right? Chris, they're one in five. So they're going to be two in five. Two in five. They're going to be. Oh, they're going to be. Yeah. Hopefully. Yeah. Speaking of their existence, Mitch, cause having the six goal game. That'd be awesome. And then hopefully after Sunday, when I'm at the game on Sunday, they'll be a game. What's up? Yeah. Yeah. That'll be insane. I mean, I think that's going to be a great way to go. We'll be three in five. So we'll be climbing back up on the standing. So that'll be good to see. But, but yeah, as Chris was just saying, I mean, just piggyback off that very young team, a lot of inexperience. I mean, a lot of guys were just trying to figure out what the role, what their role is and what, what their job is. So I think this team has a lot of growing to do. And I mean, once, once everything is really, I mean, the puzzles are in the pieces. I really do feel that this is going to be a good working oil machine for short, but it's going to take time as Chris said, it's going to take time and you got to be patient. I mean, just like we were for the, for the six years and then it just like exploded in our faces and whatever. And now it's still exploding in our faces. So, I mean, that's why it's kind of hard for us as Philly fans to kind of trust the whole kind of process kind of thing, especially like a building kind of process. So we'll see what happens. I do feel like though this will come back and it'll actually be something productive and not something negative. So we'll just going to have to wait and see what happens. Yeah. And one more thing before we move on. Mitch Cobb is on pace for a point a game right now. He's got seven points in seven games for a rookie to have a point a game is like, it's not unheard of, but it's something the Flyers, I don't think it ever had. So that's one thing to watch out for is can he continue this pace and get a point a game. He's leading the team in goals already. So, I mean, the guy's 19 years old and showing a ton of flashes already. So he's here and it's at least, I think that's just the thing that excites me. It's almost like when we first got in bead with the Sixers, you could tell that generational type talent was there and it's already coming to fruition and we'll see where it goes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, for like you guys have said for him and Jet, what the two have already done to turn the organization. It's like, it's amazing what a good attitude can do. You know, you almost want to say to Conor Baddard like, hey, this is what could have been if you got your shit together, but I'm so happy it worked out the way that it did. I think it couldn't have worked out better for Flyers fans as well. But the direction that the organization is headed is so refreshing, so awesome, so great to see as a fan. Now, coming out slow. I mean, Chris said it earlier and I just want to say it again. A team with no expectations is like the best team to root for and watch because anytime that they do anything, you can go crazy because they suck. We didn't know that with the Phillies this year, obviously. We knew that a couple years ago when the Phillies went to the World Series because nobody really expected them to. Same thing with the Eagles when they won the Super Bowl in 2018 and when they went to the Super Bowl, I guess you could say in 2022, nobody really. So there's something to be said for teams in Philadelphia that have no business being in a championship, being in a championship. There's also something said for, I don't know why, but first year players or first year things working out for Philadelphia teams and them ending up in championships and some guys winning something in their rookie year. Look at Jake Elliott. That's still a crazy story for the Eagles. But I'll say this about Mishkov. I just love the way that he embraces the city too. Like you see, I saw, I guess he went to the Phillies playoff game a couple weeks back or something and he was in a parking lot and there's this random dude. He's like, no different than Chris or KJ or me or somebody that's like a diehard Flyers fan in the parking lot tailgating the Phillies game. Just an average dude walks up and basically he's like, Holy shit, that's Mishkov. And he's like, yo, like go Phil's and Mishkov like who barely speaks any English in the video is saying go Phil's and he's like embracing it. So when you see somebody that just backs the city like that buys in and they've only been here a short amount of time, it's awesome. It's great to see. And speaking of another guy who's only been here for a short amount of time, but he even said it in his own press conference. He feels like he's been here for a while with the way that this team treats him, the way that these fans treat him top to bottom. And I'm talking about the King of New York. No, JJ Segalo, not you, you motherfucker. I'm talking about the real King of New York. Sey Kwan Park. We didn't know what to expect with this game. We knew that Sey Kwan was going to go off. We didn't know which way he was going to give it to him. I mean, he just gave it to him straight. There were a lot of plays both sides of the ball that were made, but the score, the score, I think told the story that you needed to know. The Giants had a couple of sacks here and there. I'll give them credit where credit's due. But other than that, they really didn't do anything, anything game. Offensively, they were catastrophe. The Eagles defense was all over them. I mean, as a fan in the stands, it was great because we were just dominating them, dominating them. And as a Giants fan, they were all demoralized. Like that one touchdown to AJ Brown, I saw it in slow motion. I was like eating nachos and I was like, it was crazy. And I just want to say shout out with everybody that shows us the hospitality there year after year and each other because that was a pretty fun tailgate that we had going on on Sunday and an even better result. It was like the cherry on top for the drive. Yeah. It was a great time for sure. And it was great seeing Saekwon, honestly, just get his revenge that he wanted. And I think if you heard the stories beforehand, he was on the team bus. I heard a story that he was on the team bus and there was a bunch of Giants fans with a poll that had Saekwon Barkley's Giants jersey and they burned it in front of his eyes. And he didn't seem fazed by it. He just took that as motivation. He's just like, you know what? I'm just going to do my job out there. I mean, they're doing that stuff. Obviously, they'll seem disrespectful, but that means that they miss me and stuff like that because they do. And it was, I'll tell you one thing, being at that stadium, hearing the horrific, I don't know if you guys heard it or not. I didn't even get to say it really. And I think it was only from a couple of people, but then I also heard it in general though. People were booing and they were putting a lot of the hate towards Saekwon. There were jerseys that said traitor. There was jerseys that said snake one turncoat. Yeah. Yeah. Something coat or whatever. JJ had to figure out what turncoat meant. He looked at Mikey D. He's like, what does turncoat mean? And Mikey D. Like, yeah, we don't know what turncoat means. That's some Paul Revere shit. Don't worry, KJ. It's not going to be ashamed of like fucking weird ass word. And Mikey D. Of course, he's like, he's like, well, a turncoat. And then he told us what turncoat. A turncoat is like a coat you don't want to wear. And we're like, oh, okay. And we looked it up and sure shit, Mike was right. And it's basically like an old way to say like traitor, but go ahead, KJ. Don't worry. There's nothing bad about it. Turncoat. Yeah, that was, but that was interesting. I mean, I heard some very vulgar comments about Saekwon. Not as just a player, but as a man. And it was just, it was like all the heat that Philadelphia sports fans get. I mean, it was just, I mean, we've seen it though with New York and it seems like they don't get too much heat. They came to the sexer stadium and got bought a bunch of our gear and they burned it in like a pile. And then obviously I know Saekwon leaves, but you're putting all the blame on Saekwon himself. But really when it was your GM that screwed the pooch, he was the main reason they were making the wrong guy. And that's what really ticked me off because like people like, oh, he left. He's a traitor. Screw you, Saekwon. It's like, no, your GM had a chance to not pay Daniel Jones. It showed that you made the wrong decision because Daniel Jones didn't even throw for a touchdown in this game. Heck, he hasn't even thrown for a touchdown at MetLife Stadium this year. I mean, he's just a joke. And when the heck in your head, did you think it was any bit of a good idea to be like, you know what? I'm going to give him this much of a contract that he doesn't deserve and not pay your running back. And I get it sometimes. You don't want to pay a running back sometimes because the running back position, it's just not as valuable as a quarterback position. But Daniel Jones is not valuable. That's the problem. He's not valuable. So I don't see why the heck, like it's almost like when the Titans, they decided, okay, you know what? You know, they're going to take it away. AJ Brown. Another bonehead general manager decision by an organization. And I mean, the Eagles are just a team to find out and they're able to swoop in and get Saquon. So I mean, who does the Howie for honestly getting Saquon here, making him feel at home. And I mean, we're just making him feel at home with the fans. And that's great to see because, I mean, even though there's so many Saquon haters there, there were a lot of people there that were supporting Saquon and we'd love to see him get in the end zone twice. That was electric. I mean, we were going insane. That was just, it almost felt like even though it wasn't a home game, you had enough. It was a home game. Yeah. You had enough Eagles fans there to make it feel like it was a home game. And the one thing I want to say to Mac off of your point, there were mostly Saquon jerseys there for Eagles fans. Like most of the Eagles jerseys were Saquon jerseys. So that was kind of cool to see like fire fought with ice. You know what I mean with the Giants? Like they're going to wear their turncoat jerseys or their other Giants jerseys. We're all decked out in Saquon. You know what I mean? Like that was cool to say. Yeah. Yeah. What's up? I think the one thing that truly speaks to how great not just on the field Saquon is, but just as a person in general is when Sirianni went to him and asked him if he wanted to stay in the game, he's got 13 yards to tie his career high. And this was like, what, the end of the third quarter. Like he would have beat that record. No problem. He said, let the young, let the young dogs eat. That is just like such a selfless thing. He could have broke his career high against his former team and he sits back there and you know what? He said, you know what? Let game well get some carries. Let Will Shipley get some carries. That's just, it's incredible. Not only the player they got, but the person they got as well. And I think a lot of this stuff with the Giants fans, it's just, it's jealousy because they know what he is. And I mean, I really feel bad for Gisel because he was out there. Like he was like on the verge of tears. Like it was just, I mean, this is a lot. This was a lot of Giants fans favorite player. I mean, they've had some really bleak years and the one thing they had is a running back who would go in and burst off a big 30 yard run here and there. I'll say, Kwann did that three times in one game and ran the fastest he ever did in his career against his former team. So just to see the way he say Kwann was, it's incredible. I'm so glad he's an Eagle. I'm glad it was only 17 carries he had to do. Let's keep these carries down. Let's keep him healthy. Let's keep rolling. It's hard to watch that. You're right. I mean, I get Gisel's pain too. And shout out to Gisel too. If he's listening to the show, we love you man. Thanks for hosting us as always. But that's got to suck too to see your favorite player go to your right. Like that was the one thing that all the Giants fans kept saying is he could have picked any other team. But at the end of the day, you got to go to who's giving you the best money. You got to go to who's giving you, you know, the best opportunity to win a Super Bowl and say Kwann probably looked across, you know, the NFC East a long time ago. I think longer than you guys think and though, huh. Maybe the grass is literally and metaphorically greener on the other side and being greener. Yeah. So better turf as well. Yeah, there you go as well. But it was nice to see to the go ahead. Did you want to say something, Chris? Do you think that he wanted to get taken out of the game a little bit so we didn't get hurt on that turf? Yes, I actually glad that you asked that. I think that there's part of that to it, too. Like there's almost like, okay, these guys are going like ham hardest fuck and I just went ham hardest fuck the whole game. And obviously I just proved myself. It's almost like he has nothing else to prove. So why go out there when they're all playing bully ball looking to kill him, looking to, you know, hurt him, looking to, you know, ruin his season, not saying they're looking to injure somebody, but they're looking to put him on his ass, which could hurt him. And I think it was I think it was strategic, but it was also selfless. So it was a combination of the two where it just worked out. I don't think he knew when he did it though that it would be this whole media thing. I don't think he knew that at all. So Eagles defense though, I mean, that was the one thing I want to highlight as well. It was so appetizing, wholesome, whatever word you want to use to describe it. I had a bunch of them when we were there, but it was just great to see a nice Eagles complete win and especially defensively. I mean, Vic Fangio, you got to give credit to where credit's due. And he has really had this team playing, I think, on a whole other level to where they've been in tune. They know what the offense is going to run before the offense runs it. And they seem like wizards, wizards of the game. They seem like technicians. And I haven't been able to say that about the Eagles defense in at least the season since Ganon was here. So it is very, very nice to see that and very refreshing that he's got these guys playing top tier ball. He's got these guys, you know, doing the things that they need to be doing and coming in prepared because that's your defensive coordinator's job at the end of the day is to make sure your team is prepared. We all know Brian fucking John or I'm sorry, Sean decide did not have anybody prepared. Well, Brian Johnson to I guess that's why my brain said that. But Sean decide was basically non-existent as a defensive core. I don't I don't even know if he talked in a locker room. I never heard him say anything and I can't remember any of his press conferences. So you need somebody that can kind of be like that old head. I know that that was kind of our beef. I want to go back to that because we all said it myself, especially when Vic came here. We were hypothetically scared of Vic because his age and his way to connect with this team. Some of the things that people were saying like Brandon Graham. Oh, you know, Vic, he's going to be stuck in his ways. But maybe it's a good thing. Maybe Vic Fangio like we thought knows what he's doing. And maybe this is his final swanson and it's going to be a benefit for the Eagles. But I mean, golly, the past two weeks, I think no touchdowns allowed or something I saw too, which is like fucking nuts for a defensive coordinator. Yeah. And the one thing that Vic Fangio is really doing is is finding a way to make adjustments and get struggling players into a better position. I mean, Bryce Huff, the other day, look tremendous. He looked like the player that we signed like that we thought we were getting when we signed. And for him, you know, OK, he feels more comfortable out of this stance than the other stance. And I trashed him for that in our pregame comfort in our pregame podcast. And what does he do? He goes out there and gets a sec. So I'm glad they are, you know, making adjustments and a secondary is playing extremely, extremely well. Quinion Mitchell, man, he's just like he's locked down like he he. Malik neighbors is going to be hell over receiver in the NFL. He already is a hell of a receiver in the NFL. Get one catch against Quinion Mitchell for like six yards. That's it's just incredible what he's doing out there. Yeah, I know the interceptions aren't there, but when you can just trust that you can have a rookie out there against legit wide receivers. It's just such a comforting thing. And the same with Cooper DeGene, he's been tremendous. And yeah, I've busted on Slay for a while, but he was really good the other day as well. So to see these guys starting to gel as a unit now, it's really good to see. And hopefully this past rush continues to do what the past rush did this week. Because they just they look like they're cooking at all aspects. And even I mean, Nicoby Dean had two sacks. Like you look every single aspect of this defense, defensive tackles, defensive ends, linebackers, corners, safeties. They were all all over the field on Sunday. And if they can continue to do that, I mean, you're looking at the top five defense in the NFL, if they can hold that up. Now it's the Philadelphia Eagles. So are they going to hold that up? I don't know. Yeah, I think it was an adult was just saying before. I mean, in two weeks, we haven't let up a touchdown. I will say this, though, we did play against two of the worst teams in the NFL. That is one of the, I guess you can. Yes, it's one of the obvious points, I guess you can say. But it is still impressive. I still feel like it is because I think they're also using these two games as building blocks for them to still keep aggressive as a defense. As Chris pointed to as before, Nacobi Dean, I mean, that's great to see a linebacker getting to sacks really in this kind of game and this kind of error right now. You really don't see too many linebackers getting sacks, especially with the Eagles. I mean, I don't really remember ever seeing an eagle really get a crazy game of multiple sacks like that. So he just, he looked awesome. I mean, he looked like the linebacker we really wanted him to be. And hopefully he could keep it up. I mean, I don't know if they're going to keep him going with the Blitz again, but we'll see. I mean, Vic Fangio, I think he was, this was a good two weeks to test out the defense and really see what kind of potential they have and really try to see what he can do to actually help mold this defense into, as Chris was saying before, and maybe an elite defense. Not saying they are an elite defense because they did just play two of the worst offenses in the league, but this could be a building block for sure. And it was really cool to see Quinn, as Chris was saying as well, Quinion Mitchell and Cooper Dizine out there really just locking down these receivers. Now they aren't the best receivers. Malik neighbors obviously a rookie, but you got some other guys too like Wanda Robinson, who is a, who's on one of my fantasy teams. I mean, he's a pretty decent receiver. He wasn't really getting anything at all. So yeah, it was really good to see those young guys really go at it and really just like keep the, keep the Fort locked down. So that was good. And yeah, to see Bryce Huff. I mean, at first I was saying this with Jack, me and Jack were actually at the beginning of the game. We were really trying to study what John, not Bryce Huff. See, I caught myself there adult. I caught myself. And so that's what Bryce Huff was doing. And we noticed that first that he was kind of jogging. He was jogging when he was going for a blitz and we're like, okay, this is where it seems like he doesn't want to play. He doesn't want to be here. But then I think it was either in the second quarter or the third quarter. He actually went full throttle and I think what Chris was saying before he went in a different stands. I think Vic Vanjo said, okay, do your stance that you are used to here at MetLife Stadium. You're used to do it best and go at the quarterback. And that's what he did. And he got a sack. So that was great to say. And they looked really, they looked really, they looked really good. So hopefully they can keep it up. I mean, you got a, I mean, an offensive line in the Bengals, which is almost as bad as the Giants, but they're a little better. So, I mean, you could try and expose that offensive line. So, I mean, if they do that, that'll be great. And they can maybe shut down Joe Barrow this weekend. Yeah, I think you guys both pretty much hit the nail on the head with the defense. Moving along now to our Sixers. KJ, I'll let you go ahead and take this one first. So the Sixers are playing right now. I haven't even looked at the score for an update, but it's not looking good from the intro game. On, I guess you could say the season opener on Wednesday and Bede and George both not playing, but what's up with this team, man? What's going on? Right now they are, I believe they are winning. It says they're winning. I think it says they're winning 27 to 26. It's still really early. This team right now is actually, and I really hope that they, and I know I'm saying this as a Sixers fan, I want them to get fined for what they're doing. I want them to get fined for the load management crap that they're doing. They should get fined because you're paying Joe well and Bede this crazy amount of money and it's for him to play, not to watch, not to just manage his injuries and everything, everything like that. I get what you're trying to do, but dude, we're paying this guy and it just bothers me a lot. It really does as a basketball fan, as a fan of who believed in NB and I'm starting to not really believe in the guy and hopefully I can get that belief back. I really hope we can as Sixers fans, but it's hard to really believe in that when you realize that NB actually isn't really hurt right now. They're really trying to arrest him right now and that just doesn't rub me the right way at all. It just doesn't. Paul George, that's a different story. Paul George is actually injured. We saw that he was playing the preseason. He injured his, I mean, it could have been a horrible injury to his knee. It could have been way more horrific, but it's going to be, he'll be back in like, I think it said this game and then the next game, he should be back in like two more games. So we'll see PG back in the court for the Sixers, but I like though the rotation they have. I know that they didn't have that good of a game against the Bucks. I really do feel like this rotation is really deep and I like that because we haven't had that for a while. We haven't really had a rotation where we feel like, okay, we're confident with our sixth man or our ninth man on the team where we feel like, you know, he can come in and he can fill the void of where like if NB does get injured or somebody does get injured or somebody's struggling. So that's the main thing I feel like with the Sixers. So I mean, obviously it didn't have a good game, but let's see what else they can do when they get back and beat and Paul George. Let's just say, but I'm not happy with the whole load management crap. I just think it's total bull crap to the diehard fans, especially the ones that paid for the home opener. I mean, expecting that they were going to see and beat and Paul George and the team didn't tell them till last minute. So that was screwed up. I really do feel like that was screwed up. Yeah, this is the least excited I've been for Sixers team in years. And you guys both know I wasn't the throat on the whole Paul George signing. Like I just didn't think it moved the needle at all. And now you got Joel Embiid who's ramping up to play. It's like what he was fine when he played in the Olympics and they're saying he didn't get it hurt in the Olympics. So what the hell is he ramping up for? What's he not doing in the off season? Like you just paid this dude nearly $200 million over three years. He's not ready to play basketball. What is going on? Like that. That this is just like a joke at this point. If Joel Embiid's not serious about basketball, then why the hell is he on the team? I know he's a hell of a player. But why is he not ready? It's just it's a joke at this point. And I feel like these people who pay money for season tickets should get their money back. Because now you're saying, oh, he's not going to play back to back. So how many games are you going to play at home? Like you got people paying for season tickets and they're not going to see the best player in the NBA for majority of those games for load management. It's bullshit. He's not even hurt. And if he is hurt, how do you get hurt? It's a whole nother situation here. And then, oh, the sisters are probably going to dock draft picks because they don't know how to fucking manage it. It's just it's a really bad organization. They got too much shit going on. The team wants to move to center city now. Like it's just it's a joke. Josh Harris needs to sell this damn team already. Like go focus on the commanders. Goodbye. Get the fuck out of Philadelphia. You're a bum. I'm tired of this shit with the Sixers. Like just in mediocrity. We started this whole process because we couldn't get past the second round. We still can't get past the fucking second round. What is going to change here? Nothing. Nothing has changed. Let's just keep signing aging superstars to act like it's going to help. When I got two aging superstars because I don't know how much longer to own beats going to be able to play. If he can't play back to back now. Why did you sign into a $200 million deal? It's a joke. They operate on the heart. It really doesn't make any sense. Josh Harris is a joke of an owner in general. And I agree with Chris. The problem is though he's so entitled and he just doesn't care about the fans at all. Which it's funny though because commanders fans are like oh Josh Harris what a great owner he is. I'm going to tell you this right now. Josh Harris fans. I'm going to tell you this right now. He's a horrible owner. Horrible. Obviously he's no Snyder. He's no Snyder. Yeah I'm going to say that's what we were all about to say. They had Dan Snyder to work with before. Yeah he's no Snyder but he just doesn't care about. I mean he's got too many teams right now. And obviously the commanders are his priority right now. It's his baby. And I mean the Sixers are just a number to him. Yeah the Sixers are just his teenage child. That's what it is with the Sixers that just goes in his room and just plays video games. That's what it is Dan. Yeah it's just with the Sixers it's what the hell is going on every week. And I haven't even watched the game yet. I won't watch the game tonight. I might go to a game or two this year maybe. But I'm starting to wonder if maybe it's not the Sixers. If maybe it's not the Flyers. Maybe it's Wells Fargo. Because how the fuck are these two teams this consistently fucked out like this. I don't know. I really don't. They're like KJ's right. I mean the thing it's funny KJ. I had redheaded stepchild written down on my notes. But the thing I had written down was the Sixers are like a cheeto. At a fancy cheese tasting. They are just out of their own league all the time. You look at all the other and that was in regards to all the other Philly sports teams like the Flyers. The Eagles. The Phillies. The Eagles and Philly specifically. Yeah they haven't won the big one in a couple of years. But at least they get there. Like at least they've gotten there in the past couple of years. There's something to be said for that. They can't even fucking get there. They're like the little engine that fucking couldn't. And they're not getting any better. So at this point it's just like. I guess what I'm trying to say with Embiid in this injury thing is you guys are right. There is no injury. There's no problem. But when I heard Nick Nurse talk about it the other day I honestly couldn't blame the guy. Because he said it like this. He said look. The one thing we haven't tried yet with Embiid is getting into the playoffs healthy. So I think that the Sixers are going to slick and slide their way in whatever way they can get Embiid into the playoffs playing healthy. If it costs them some money and some fines. Whatever. Like I think that they are really all in on winning a championship this year and the top priority for the Sixers in winning a championship is making sure Joel is healthy. And I think that by doing this they're looking to protect him because he can prove it during the regular season. He's done that. As far as how do I feel about that. It's not not a good product on the court. It's not a good product for your fans and it is not fair to season ticket holders which is why I don't even want to waste my breath anymore on the Sixers. Sorry. I will say one more thing though. I also feel like if you don't play them together though as we said before they're not going to have any chemistry. So then when the playoffs do come up where the heck's going to be the chemistry. So hopefully these guys Paul George and and B can keep some kind of chemistry going somehow and hopefully they're still working on that. But yeah that's that's that's the problem with it though. I totally agree and I feel bad for Nick Nurse because I feel like he's the right coach for this position and the right coach for this team. But it's just Embiid is just holding him back from being the coach that we wanted for this organization. So but but yeah we could just move on from it because taking away KJ we're going into Cincinnati into the jungle to play the good looking handsome devil himself and Joe Burrow. Yeah. You nervous you excited you combination of the two. I'm not nervous. Not really nervous. I do feel like the Bengals have kind of been they've been kind of slow out the gate. It seems like I mean they haven't really I think what's their record right now. They're like what they two and three right now or something like that. I think they're I forget their record. But they're they're on the slow rate right now. It seems like and Burrow has been looking iffy but he's also been able to get Jamar Chase involved. So that's that's a good thing. And I think we got we got to just watch out for that too. We got to watch out for that. I heard that T Higgins might be questionable. I do know for the Eagles though. I don't know if you guys heard this Dallas Goddard will not be playing. It says that he is not to be playing this weekend. So it seems like we'll we'll be having Calcuttaire and stole out there manning the ship at the tight end position. It seems like but but you have adult you're muted. Now you're good KJ. I was going to say something when you were done. But yeah I think it's it's going to be interesting game. I predicted this on the show on Wednesday. I think the Eagles do keep this close. I do think they get they actually sneak the win. I think they win twenty six to twenty. I think they somehow just win by six points. And I don't know how but they're going to win. They're going to actually take the points this time. They're going to take the points next year on is going to be very strategic and he's going to be smart somehow. I don't know why I'm thinking this but I think they're going to win twenty six to twenty. Now the defense is not going to have I mean that much of a dominant defensive performance they had against the Giants. I think the Bengals are going to be a little tougher. The offensive line is going to be a little tougher. So you won't be seeing those young bucks out there getting the I guess you could say the activity that they had last week against the Giants with the I guess in the sack margin. Yeah I'll say this because I got to be a little bit quicker just because we got a wrap up here in a minute. I'm excited for it. I think it's going to be an entertaining game. The Bengals are notoriously a team that the Eagles have struggled against. We all know it unfortunately but I think that this is going to be a game that Jalen Hertz sort of plays up to. I was listening to WIP today and a guy called in and he said it and I was laughing my ass off at it because it's kind of true. And he said something along the lines of Jalen Hertz plays up to good competition. And when he played Patrick Mahomes when he played Josh Allen there was another QB in that list too. I'm drawing a blank on who but he basically plays up to them. He has something to prove and he really does. So I think in this game Joe Burrow being somebody that's so highly respected in his draft class somebody that was taking you know so early. I think he's going to sort of say OK you know what like I want to show that I want the same level as this guy. I want to show that athletically like I can do the same things that he can do. Now is he on the same IQ on the same you know playing level maybe not so much but does he have the better team. Hell to the yeah. Does Joe Burrow have an AJ Brown or Saquon Barkley or Devonte Smith. He has Jamar Chase but he doesn't have that whole fucking grocery list that's going to you know feed him for weeks. Jalen Hertz has no excuses like this shouldn't be a close game. I think that this should be at least a two score win for the Eagles with what we saw last week. The Bengals defense I mean looking at it. There's like two guys that I could have told you before on the team being Sam Hubbard their left defensive end in the Trey Hendrickson their right defensive end other than that I mean there's really nobody that we talk about on their deep Vondell maybe Cams Taylor Britt maybe but like ever since Jesse Bates left the Bengals defense has been pretty much non-existent. So I expect the Eagles the Eagles offense needs to put up at least 35 points this game in my opinion. We'll say yeah I think that you are really really really underselling the Bengals. Three of the four Bengals losses came against the Chiefs commanders and Ravens who are really really good teams. So it was the other one. This is a really tough game and the Eagles was never one in Cincinnati at all. So it's it's not going to be easy game whatsoever. The Bengals their defense on paper isn't great but I feel like they play up the way they play. So like they play better than what the talent shows. So it's going to be a little bit tougher game than you expect. They got really big defensive ends. So it might be a little bit tougher to run against them which means you're going to have to have Jalen Hertz beat you. You're going to have to have Jalen Hertz carry you and really I mean the last two games they've won haven't been because of Jalen Hertz. It's been because of the wrong game. So I hope it's a little bit different. Defense needs to get pressure on Borough. They can't just let him sit back there and throw the Jomar Chase all day. I see it being like a really low scoring close game like a 21-17 type game. But I honestly don't think the Eagles are going to win. I really think Joe Borough is going to pull this one out. You kind of just can't count out Joe Borough sometimes. I think he's been a little bit overhated here over the last two or three years since they went to the Super Bowl and lost. I think he's a much better quarterback than what he showed and he's had some injury problems and stuff like that. But yeah, I just I think Joe Borough is going to out duel Jalen Hertz here and just sneak out of win. Yeah, I think you're right. And you're not wrong. Look, I'm not trying to undersell the bangles, but I do think that just their defense, the Eagles should, should keyword should. That's the problem. But will they? That's the main question. Will they? We'll find out. Another thing to keep an eye on two guys is the brothers will be playing in Sydney and Chase Brown. So that'll be kind of fun to watch with Sydney being on defense. Chase has already seen that yet Chase is started this week out running back for the bangles. So that's pretty cool. Congratulations to his brother. He is fast as shit. I saw where that speed came from on the pick six, but it's going to be a good game.
