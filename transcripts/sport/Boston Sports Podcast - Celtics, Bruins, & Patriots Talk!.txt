 YoungCath Bossesports podcast and this week we are I think getting back in somewhat of a rhythm. We're changing it up in one way. We're doing a live stream, but we're going to try and touch on all three sports. I think nothing is off limits, Dad. I don't know. We'll try and give it as much structure as we can, especially going forward. Jumping into this new format will probably make some changes and it'll seem a little weird, but as we go forward it'll become more and more structure. How do you see this working out going forward? Now that the Patriots have showed us, they don't really deserve as much time as we were given them. Yeah, we're just going to go with something similar to what we used to do, which is a show once a week where we touch on all the teams except we're going to be live so people can chime in, comment, questions, and you know. But today we're probably not going to touch on the Patriots unless people insist on it. I'd like to focus on the Bruins and Celtics. We gave them way too much love yesterday. We're not going to be doing a Patriots pre-game, post-game show anymore. We're going to try to stick with Monday night, touching on all three teams, and you know, best of given the Celtics the love they deserve because they are the reigning champs and they're amazing. And then you get the Bruins who off to a rough start, but you know, they're still loaded and they're still definitely good enough to win a championship. And they did everything they can to load up and win a championship. And we like to focus on teams in Boston that go for championships. And right now the Celtics and Bruins are the only ones, the Red Sox Patriots are not exactly swinging for the fences. So they're building for the future. Now let's see. All right, so do we start with the Bruins? Yeah, let's talk about the Bruins because we are going to probably have to spend most of this later part in the Celtics because again, it's semi pre-game, right? So let's talk about the Bruins, right? Matt Pacha got an assist last night. He's moving up a little bit in the lineup, playing a bit of second line minutes, which we're super excited about. You know, my buddy Andrew Bailey, he talked about, you know, Martian being a bit lackluster. And then a few minutes later, Martian seals overtime for him. So that was kind of a bit of a nice surprise seeing Martian get on the scoreboard for a few games. Dad, I mean, this is almost like repeats last year. And so really quickly I'll touch on. So I was beyond happy at school today. I put the Bruins flag up on my chalkboard. Yeah, and you're in Toronto, I'm pretty sure. So I'd imagine that was a lot of drama. I mean, if you couldn't escape the wounds, as a least saying, you walked into the first game as a self against the Bruins, you're losing overtime again, just like you lost in overtime in game seven. It's just like fresh wounds. There were so many salty Leafs fans. I mean, my condolences. I got to break through one of these days, telling you. Every year the Bruins hope to play Leafs in the playoffs. What are these days they're going to break through? They're just too talented. Hopefully it doesn't happen anytime soon. But the Bruins, you know, not to start a vision, that's for sure. And, you know, I hate to say it, but Montgomery, I feel like has to go. It's just not working with him. And I would like a coach to come in that has some influence, isn't afraid to push back against, you know, nearly against Sweeney. I'd like an offensive guy so he can look at these players in practice and go, there's not enough here offensively. I need some offensive talent, because that is their biggest problem. I cried about this all last year before the playoffs. The old bull was right. What ultimately doomed the Bruins in the playoffs was their offense. It wasn't their goal 10. It wasn't their defense. Both of those were excellent. I need an offensive guy to come in here and shake things up saying, no, no, no, this dude is not a second line player. He's going down there. Who do you got for prospects? Give me the slice all kid. Let me try him. Potra is way more talented than Coyle offensively. Let's move him up, because it's just not working. This offense is just so bogged down. And I get it. The defense has been pretty bad. The goal 10 has been shaky. I'm not worried about those though. They're just too talented in those two departments. By the end of the year, I feel like those will be locked up and perfectly fine. But again, we need to see more offense. This team has showed nothing yet to show that even though they added, Lin Holm, they're not quite there yet. Yeah, and I completely agree. I think one of the biggest telling and funny situations I saw with how bad our offense has been is I was looking at the box scores or the games from the NHL coming up. And they have the star to watch for all the games. And you saw like, you know, Evangie Malke and you saw, you know, Connor McDavey, you saw McKinnon on there, the Forrest Bird kid from like Nashville. Can you guess dad who the star to watch was for the Boston Bruins? Not against the Leafs, but the game before that. I think it was against Nashville. I don't know. It was it was Koki or whatever his name is, our fourth line player, because that's what ESPN's AI is telling them is our standout guy. So I mean, it's really rough out there for a Bruins fans when it comes to trying to, my buddy Andrew and Autumn, you know, they're huge Bruins fans. And I was like, you don't have to watch the Bruins unless the fourth line is out there, because that's where all the sparks come from, it seems. So Jeff, I know, and I agree with the old bull, I will say, though, the Bruins actually dominated the first and third periods on Saturday against that Leafs team. And I mean, that maybe that's a spark game. That's a huge grudge match. You got to get up, got to get up against the Leafs. It's good to see the team show up and actually win it. It does suck. We had to go to overtime. I was hoping we could have closed it out. But I mean, that might be a turning point win, dad. I mean, how do you feel about the win overall against the Leafs, at least that one game in a microcosm? I mean, if it delays Montgomery getting fired, I'm not crazy about it. But you know, a lot of that, the last two years, that's plagued the Bruins, having a lead, two minutes left in the game, and then they choke it away. You know, so again, could use the coach and change there. Montgomery has been the coach for the last two years, and that's been the biggest Bruins problem, you know, besides the offense, which is giving up leads in the last couple minutes of games and periods. And here it goes, rear and its ugly head again. You know, Toronto's good. They're super offensive. They're super talented. But that's no excuse, man. It's supposed to be hard to score a goal on you, even if they have pulled the goalie knowing that's all they're trying to do. And you're just setting up a barricade in front of the goal, your own goal tender. It's supposed to be hard. And the Bruins have an uncanny knack for giving up goals in that situation. It's just terrible. We just need a fresh start, I feel like. Man, so the old goal is calling for a lot, like a lot of resumes to be submitted in New England. So that's Mayo, you won out, and that is Montgomery. I mean, Dad, like one year ago, could you believe that would be what you and I both agree on, that Joe Missoula is by far and away the best coach in New England? I mean, and I think it's not even a competition at this point. Joe is the man. And my dad and I were ripping on Joe last year. We had a bunch of problems, but now it's Monty, and it's definitely Mayo on the chopping block. And I completely agree. Monty, he was supposed to come in, be a young players kind of coach, helped develop those guys. I think Pete's the one who pointed that out. And Monty has not provided that for the Bruins at all. Lysos still down in Providence. And Pochera is deaf. I mean, I appreciate Pochera being up, but it took him long enough to move him up in lines. And Pochera still gets frozen out some games and has really low minutes compared to others. So I'm not... And he plays with Stiffs. And he plays with Stiff Wingers, like Wingers are no good. I'm so sick of seeing Pochera with these Wingers that are just not talented. You know, when he's still rotating Lowrye in, what the hell are you doing? Stop with that. He is not your sixth or seventh best defenseman. Lowrye is way better than that. I don't care if he makes some mistakes. They're young players. They're going to make mistakes. Stop benching them the next game. Let them get their damn confidence. It's just... I don't want you turning them into defensive robots who do nothing but back check and worry about their own end. We need offense. Let them take chances. Let Lowrye take a chance here and there. Let Pochers feel like he can make offensive plays. And oh, if he doesn't get back and defend his own 100% of the time, I'm going to be benched the next game. Stop with that crap. They're not going to learn these young kids. It's infuriating. And they've been doing this even before Montgomery going way back to Claude Gillian. Yeah. I mean, Jeff, I know, I think that's the perfect segue into Swamin'. Right? If you're paying $8 million for that guy on the back end, you've got to be able to take a chance here and there. And I mean, Swamin' has to make up for those gaps and those risks. And hopefully it pays off in some actual goals. So, I mean, how do you feel about Swamin' so far, Dad, with this contract? Do you think, you know, he put his money where his mouth is? I know it's only a few games into the season. Jeff Unknown here. Swamin' is looking solid. He's definitely earning that big contract. Do you agree? Well, most of the time, he is not all the time, though. You can tell he didn't have a training camp. That is shown because there's some goals sometimes you're like, wow, Swamin', that's goal is not like you. You know, but he still makes 10 bell saves here and there. You know, he's just not at the level he was. It's okay, though. He has all season to get there, not worried about Swamin'. We saw what he does in the biggest moments on the biggest stage in the Stanley Cup last year. Single-handedly almost took Florida Panthers to game seven, the best team in the world. He almost did that. So, and that's a good question, Jeff. I'm kind of talking to my butt, saying just replace Montgomery because I don't really have a replacement. All I know is I would like an offensive guy brought in here, kind of like what I wanted with the Patriots. Get me, I'm not worried about the defense. Their defense is loaded with talent. They will figure it out by the end of the year. They're going to be awesome defensively when the playoffs come around. I have no doubt about that. Swamin' is going to be awesome. Fix the offense. The offense has been broken forever. When your second line has two goals between Coyle and Martian in like the last 30-something games, that is terrible. That is broken. You can't have that. I know Martian is old and he's a step slower than he used to be, but he's not that bad. He's not that bad where he should have two damn goals in his last 30 freaking games or something. Three goals, whatever it is. Yeah, I mean with Martian it's tough, right? Because we've heard a lot of rumblings about him with Geeky, kind of like being a bit of a diva with who he plays in his line with. I mean, how much of this is, like you mentioned Martian's good, but how much of it is this a mental thing with Martian trying to shoehorn matchups and everything into his game? And it's just obviously not working. So I'm wondering- If he's the captain, he should not be doing that. You're the captain. You're supposed to be another coach out there. You're supposed to be in line with your coach, your head coach. And he should not be doing that. He should be being that drummer whatever coach says I'm going to play with. I've read at least two reports of Martian wanting- does not want to play with the young guys that much. So I don't know if that's why maybe Monty took some time to get Pautra into that second line because Martian wanted his guys and then finally they moved Pautra up. So it's tough because not a lot of stuff comes out. A lot of the hockey guys are very, very Beatty. You know, the spit and chiclet guys kind of sucks. Like I feel like the hockey coverage is almost worse than any sport when it comes to like these guys making these claims like they're true. But if Martian is, you know, forcing his guys in there and not letting the coaches make the decision, then I think Martian's a big problem. And I brought that up before the season started. I'm wondering how much Martian's going to have a negative effect on the season. As he gets older, it feels like he's doing the opposite of like the Char-a. It seems like, I don't know. I haven't seen too much grace with this. So that's what's frustrating for me. I don't like that. But Martian should be on a line with Pautras and Lysol. Those are the three most talented guys after the top three, after Linhom, Pasta and Zaka. Those are the next three guys. Put them together and see if you freaking got something. It's ridiculous. But anyway, that's our 15 minutes for them. Let's jump over to the Celtics. Oh, and I will say one thing really quick about the Bruins. You know, my dad, one of my dads, my dad had a very creative, like I think 10 regarding the goals. Yeah, in a minute, against the goals he goes against. And that's not going too well. The other thing my dad said was that they were going to fall for the protection line again, which would be Linhom, Martian and Pasha. And that's been making an appearance in those games. So that's kind of scary in that regard, right? You know, kind of so moving on to the, any comments on that before we move on to the Celtics? No, we have all the added touch on it, but I'm not roaring about the Bruins, you know, so unless some changes don't come at some point, we just beat our head against the same wall. But anyway, all right, Celtics, I mean, every night that they are on is an absolute pleasure. The biggest problem I have with this team is that they do not play every day. And I wish they did, because I absolutely loved watching them. They're an absolute pleasure. And man, I mean, big game tonight against the Milwaukee Bucks. I don't know if I could check this without killing the stream, but I'm really curious if Yanis is in tonight. Do you know that? Do you know that off top of your head if he's playing real quick as you're looking at that? Jeff, I know, and I'm predicting an exciting Celtics win tonight. I don't think it will be a blowout. I think the Bucks will make us earn it. Jeff, do you know they're on the second night of an away back to back? They had just lost, I think they played in Brooklyn, lost to Brooklyn, and now they're coming out to play against us, and we're arrested. This is a very similar thing that my dad and I cried about. We cried a lot, because they did this to us, and the other side of it, where we had a big tight game. I think it was like Minnesota, when it's like overtime. In the next game, we had to play facing Milwaukee, and away, and away, back to back. Joe Missoula pretty much benched his guys for the entire second half. If I'm the Bucks, I might take a page out of Joe's book and bench my guys, and despite the NBA, you're going to put probably one of the biggest matchups you can get in the Eastern Conference on the second night of an away back to back, and kind of spite them. That's why I think this game might be a blowout for that exact reason. Dad, you got any updates? Yeah, it's very simple. We tell it like it is here. The Bucks are getting screwed tonight. That's all there is to it. Bucks are getting screwed 100%. We cried about this last year. We want to see good prime time games. I want to see the Celtics get tested. When tonight ends up in a blowout, which it's probably going to, the Celtics had their little trapped game against Detroit the other day. They almost lost that one. Probably looking ahead to Milwaukee, but here comes Milwaukee. Playing a game last night, traveling, not far traveling, don't get me wrong, but it's still traveling. They're on the night of back to back. Here we go again. It's just the NBA being stupid. You have a premium matchup like this. Why is it so hard to make sure both teams have the day off before? I just don't get that. Here we go. Matt, what did you think of that Detroit game the other day? Yeah, the Detroit game was tough because we were still shooting well. They were still shooting well. I don't know if it's something where we weren't running a lot of sets and they were just letting the guys play out there, and Joe wasn't getting too involved. I don't know if that was a chess match to not show too much, but this just goes back to the parody in the NBA. I feel like the NBA is the best league right now to watch in the world when it comes to the amount of skill. No matter where the sucky teams are, they put on the court. Cade Cunningham is really good. And Jaden Ivy, same thing. These guys are athletic. They're out there. They're running fast. I mean, I think it's like you said, Dan. They probably were just thinking of Milwaukee. Everyone thought that game was going to be over very quickly. I think the best part of that game is that it really showed that a lot of the issues that we hoped were gone at the end of last year, which seemed to be gone, are carrying over into this year. They flipped the switch. Are they a team that can flip the switch? They flipped the switch at the end. Tatum, I think, scored like eight or 10 of the last 18 points for the Celtics. Huge game for Tatum. And I mean, they really just said, you know what, tired of messing around and came through. So it was a weird game. It sucked that we even let them get close, but it's almost a good thing to see them deal with adversity and come back and end up winning that game. All right. Sean Raff. Hey, good to see you, bud. Sean Raff. Good to chime in in there. A little hit of symbol. You know, the game the other night, and this has been a concern of mine. I haven't brought up because they hadn't given us a reason to yet. The first two games, the starters basically didn't play the fourth quarter, right? And that's amazing. Like we love that as fans, especially the old bull and young cap. We looked towards long term. We preach load management all the time and it worked last year. That team went in and rested. They blew everyone out. Never won past five games. That's what we want. My concern is there's still NBA players. They still like their numbers, right? And I just can't help but wonder, did they take a little bit off the gas when it comes to defense to keep these games a little closer to make sure they get some fourth quarter minutes to help there? Because none of them are going to get their points per game rebounding if they only play three quarters. I mean, that's just natural. That's just not going to happen. So, you know, are they maybe giving only 90% on defense? Like subliminally knowing that like the play to fourth quarter, you know, keep this game a little closer than, you know, I'm not necessarily saying they're saying that in their head, but if we're being honest, I don't know. Do they, and I felt like the other night was kind of that Celtic scored like 70 points in the first half, 70 something. And then over the next quarter and a half, they scored like 20. And then like you said, Matt, they flipped the switch and they woke up. But it's like, well, what happened during that almost quarter and a half? Like, you know, I felt like they just kind of got away from what they normally do, trying to turn off the defense a little bit. And I don't know, they got their fourth quarter minutes and points the other night, but I'm just just interested to see if there's more evidence of that. I think you can't like discount psycho Joe, right? There's a really good chance that this I've really good chance. This is like a, like a wet football situation with Bill Belichick, where Joe literally treated that game like practice. There were a few times when the pistons were going on runs in that fourth quarter or a third quarter, where I was like, he's going to call a timeout and they look to the bench and Joe's like, Nope, figure it out. I would not be shocked at if Joe treated that game like a practice, a simulation, right? Oh, well, what if I had no timeouts and this was the playoffs, figure it out. And I mean, what a better opportunity than against the Detroit Piston teams that it really doesn't matter. Like you said, when they're playing the long game, they got to taste the championship. So I like to take and Joe, if anything, he likes to emulate successful coaches. And that's something a successful coach would do. This is a learning opportunity for that team. And I know he loves it. So wow, that's really interesting. Old Bull is Jeff, Jeff unknown. I would never say such a thing. I'm hoping they aren't doing that, but it's possible. If I think I was a player, I'd be happy with the fourth quarter rest. Yeah. I mean, he stars like that. They're numbers. Oh, Jeff, you never know. And I like your take two, Matt. I, you know, that's it. You know, maybe, maybe Missoula did kind of manipulate that to keep it close in some way. And, you know, because they had not been challenged at first two games, that's for sure. They were like literally practices, those first two games. It was like nothing there. So I don't know. I wouldn't put it past cycle, Joe. You know, you never know. We got to get Jeff unknown back on the show for a guest appearance. So did we do that once? We did. We did. And, you know, we're good. Joe, he was really good. We're going to it's just a matter of like not making a janky. Like my dad mentioned that the start of the last, the pope, the post game, my life is just kind of upside down right now. Now that I've moved, as you can see, I'm making dinner for my kids as I'm trying to do this thing. So Joe, Jeff, you know, once we can get a little bit better structure around this thing, we're definitely going to have you on, especially talk about, you know, all this stuff. And I think is what's today the sports, sports equinox, this is the one of like one of the days of a year where we have every single sport at the same time or something like that. So no, that would be tomorrow, I believe tomorrow would be Thursday. There's no NFL. Wait, wait, wait, no, what is today? Monday? Oh, you're right. Never mind. There is. Yeah, everything's going on today. So I mean, it's exciting stuff. I'm really happy to talk about a lot of this stuff. It's, it's, it's funny because I really don't want the Dodgers or the Yankees to what I know we're not going to talk about baseball, but a lot of talk about in our world right now. Yep, I love that. Had a lot of fun. Very honored. And we were honored to have you, Jeff unknown. We're honored to talk to you every time and super thankful for you taking time out of your day. So we will, we will definitely get you on maybe next Monday, Jeff, if you're available. Dad, you shouldn't have called me to ask if I was available. You should have called Jeff to figure out what these he's, he's available because I know pretty much, right? But um, you know, I want to, I want to itch another scratch that I just can't stand again. You know, the first three games Tatum gets player of the week. Thank you, NBA, for recognizing him, you know, but you turn on first take, get up the Colin Cowichan. Browning. Nothing, just nothing on the Celtics picking up where they left off Tatum. There was a little bit when they destroyed the Knicks on that open and night, but man, nothing since then. And it's probably not going to be anything because now, now the narrative is, you know, yeah, the Celtics, they're loaded to, you know, we'll see them in the playoffs, you know, we'll see if they stay healthy and no one wants to talk about them. It's, oh, but we'll talk about a guy who has no business being in the NBA, you know, he's only there because it was father. And we'll talk about that. We're going to keep talking about the lake is, you know, that's so annoying. The Lakers are off to this start, this three and oh start because, you know, a bronze playing heavy minutes and it's like, have fun now guys. Yep. Lake is, they're playing, they're doing what the Bruins do. They're treating regular season games like playoff games. That's what the Lakers are doing right now. Like, okay, good job, man. Hey, you know what, probably be a top three seed, you keep that up all year and guess who's going to have no gas in a tank when the playoffs roll around? Love, Ron. Yeah. And AD, AD is getting up there too now. Probably times is undefeated. That is for sure. And the bronze going to, it's going to catch up to him. It's got to be this year, right? Yeah. No, absolutely. So, you know, enjoy the Tatum MVP talk because it's not going to happen because, you know, again, he's going to be sitting on a lot of these fourth quarters because they're that dominant and you just, you can't put up MVP numbers when, you know, when, when you're not playing the fourth quarter and half your games. And another thing is being the best player on the team with the best record in the NBA is no longer what it used to be. It does not. That used to be the first guy who would get all the attention. Oh, no, this guy's the best player on the best team. He gets, you know, who can catch him for the MVP? That's usually what it is. Those days are over now. It's about flash. It's about numbers. You know, he, he's just putting up more assists. That's, that'll help. You know, he's always a high rebound guy anyway, high point guy. The assists will help be a more of a defensive impact player like he has been will help. But, you know, ultimately when you're sitting half your fourth quarters, you're not going to get MVP because it's numbers based, unfortunately. Yeah. And I think this goes all the way back to Bill Russell. I saw this picture of the MVP race in one year when it was, when it was Bill Russell, Will Chamberlain, like Oscar Robinson, right? And you see Bill Russell won the MVP and he averaged like 23 rebounds per game, 16 points and, you know, so many blocks. Then you got, and he was at like 46 minutes a game. Then you had Will Chamberlain averaging like 50 points a game, 30 rebounds, and 48 minutes, like more than 48 minutes. And Bill Russell won because Bill Russell was the best player on the best team, he was the most valuable piece on the most valuable team in the league. And again, that, like you said, it's about clicks nowadays. And even though we are in like the biggest market in like all of sports, it's still not enough because LA is driving it. And man, I mean, there was like the NBA like League Pass, I saw this other thing. They had a game update and like kind of an article on every single game that happened on Saturday, but they did not have the Celtics. The first game was the Lakers and Sacramento. After that, they had every other game, but they didn't even, they didn't even make a poster, a comment about the Celtics pistons. You know what? It's just born now. The Celtics are the best and they're the balls. And dad, I mean, would you, would you have it any other way? I don't mind. Oh, no, I love it. What's up, Jason? Yeah. What's up, man? Jonathan, what's up? What's up, Lap? Yeah, Jonathan, my bad, Jonathan. Hey, I'm like, yeah, Jonathan. Oh my God, good to see you, bud. One of my old favorites from the jail. Absolutely awesome guy, you know, like many of those guys up there. I always appreciate you jumping in there, John. I really do. And yeah, we got a good one tonight, hopefully. Looks like Giannis is playing. He only went out as, you know, crusty old man Middleton. Street clothes Middleton. We'll see if the box have, you know, anything left in a tank after playing last night. Absolutely, John. Drake May is legit, my man. Hopefully he gets back in this week. That should have been his first. He got robbed of his first win. That would have been a blowout yesterday. He was already carving up the jets. That's a shame. That game's definitely not that close that Drake May plays the whole thing. That's the damn sure. And I think Drake may commented, you know, he posted like the Instagram, like, how about the boys or how about my fellas or whatever. So Drake may, you know, nice little leadership nod there, not being sour graves about getting taken out of the game. And I think John Drake may is 100% legit. He put up Dan Reno numbers in those first two games. I know I have said it like six times in this podcast. I'm going to keep saying it because it was joy to watch, especially after what we've done been dealing with. I'm excited for more Drake May. I'm really hoping his head injury is not as bad as it seems. My dad sent me an article today. Mayo had some comments on it, which I'm not 100% sure how much I like Mayo talking nowadays because it seems like he gives a lot of bad information and it's like no information is better than bad information, Jirad. You're not being forced to say anything. You don't have to lie. You don't have to be weird, but it seems like he just can't help himself. So hopefully we hear from Mayo. I mean, if Mayo is telling the truth, it is good news. It is because, you know, on the post game, I said, this is my hopes is the NFL saw it. And because of all the heat they took from Tua, the NFL is like, no, no, no, get him in the blue tent. And what my hopes was, I'm fine. He's like trying everything he can to get back up. There's guys, we're fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, but the concussion protocol people just would not pass them. And that's what I'm hoping happened. And that's what basically Jirad Mayo said happened. If you go back and read the press conference today. So hopefully he's actually telling the truth on this one. Like Matt says, he likes to give out a lot of false info. So, you know, lead the meter on or just, you know, contradicts himself later on. So hopefully that's the case. And, you know, hopefully we see him back on the field this week for, you know, for another game where he develops and gets more growth. So yeah, but yeah, that's it for the show. We get the game coming on. Yo, bull is going to take off. I got things I get to All right, go South and some thank you everyone for tuning in. Please subscribe to our YouTube channel and we will see you next Monday. We'll let you know what time. All right, goodbye.
