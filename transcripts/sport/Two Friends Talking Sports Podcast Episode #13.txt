 and in for the second half. Oh, what is going on everybody? Sports expert here and we are here with the two friends Toggin Sports Podcast. I'm the sports expert Max and I'm here with my partner and good friend Ken Dogg. Yes sir, Ken Dogg Sports in the house, y'all. Yes sir. Sorry we took a couple weeks off because of school and. Yeah. But yeah, we're back for our nearly monthly episodes. But we'll have episode at least once or twice for Thanksgiving. Yeah. One of them's for a normal episode, one's gonna be Ohio State Michigan. Ohio State Michigan, Ohio State's gonna put them out though. We'll still do a preview stream. Yeah, yeah. Well actually I don't even know, we almost lost in Alaska so. Hey, but I'm so sane. We're still doing a preview stream. Yeah. Nonetheless. Yeah. But yeah, how's it been so far? How's your football is going lately? What do you mean by football? Like how's your football, how you been watching, how's your football team's going? I mean they're doing okay. The Cleveland Browns won yesterday. They were able to beat the Baltimore Ravens somehow 29-24. Finally getting a victory Monday. Yeah, with famous James. Packers won again? No, didn't watch them. Yeah, Packers won, you know, close game with the Jags. But Jordan Love, they're saying he's okay. Wake Wolfs isn't that bad though, just surprising. Hey, Titans didn't wrong. Yeah. I hate the Titans. Yeah. What's up, Kobe? Hey, there's Mid-Coby. There's a very new member. There's Mid-Like Kobe. Am I wrong about that one? You are not wrong. Mid-Like Kobe. Although Kobe is voting for the right human being on election day. Who? What do you mean? Who's that? You know who it is. Donald J. Trump. Yes, sir. We too. Hey, I already voted. Nice. Did you vote yet? Not yet. I'll probably just do it on election day or something like that. Heck yeah. How's everyone going? Baseball ever since I last talked to you? Both our baseball teams done. Both are. But yeah, I mean. It's just been a sad month, but a lot of good things happen lately. Yeah, I mean, speaking of Michigan football, did you see the news tonight, Kenny? Jack Tuttle guy retired. He's done. That's another mid-season retirement. We had Grayson McCall from NC State last week and now Jack Tuttle from Michigan. That's two starting quarterbacks in the Power 4 that have announced her retirement mid-season. Why is Jack Tuttle retiring? They said he had health problems. He had five concussions. Fair enough. Bro, Kobe, you were talking crap, but Kobe, you were talking crap on the Brewers when your team was doing horrible. Yeah, that's why he's mid. I'm not talking crap on the Yankees right now. I know they're losing. I'm happy they wasn't, but I'm not gonna be like, I just want the Dodgers to win the World Series just to get over with. Yeah, and I mean, I don't like the Yankees either. So, yeah, that's kind of where I stand right now. But yeah, what else is happening? Yeah, let's do our mid, let's do a report. Let's talk about NFL. We're on the NFL right now. Okay. How's his past week in the football? What do you think rate this week in the football? It was a really good weekend. I give it at least a nine out of 10. I love this week in the football as well. A lot of good games, a lot of great finishes. Packers, Jaguars, great finish. Even Thursday night football was a solid game. Unfortunately, it was ruined by officiating, but, you know. I hate rests. Yeah, I don't know if you saw that face mask on Sam. I did. Yeah, that was clear face mask. They had big money on the Rams. Come on. They had so many calls go against them. We also had, we had all 16 played this weekend. Yeah, we did. No bye weeks. How's your record looking like this week for college for football? I'm 12 and three. Let's see what my record is. I have the Steelers winning this game. They beat the Panthers Colby. I don't think that's impressive. Out of all the games we could have talked about Colby, you're talking about the Broncos Panthers game. The worst game. Broncos Panthers don't really matter at all. I know, that was terrible. Yeah, I mean, you should because Bonick is horrible and he's five and three with them. My record is 11 and four. 11 and four. I had the Vikings loss, the Ravens loss, the Jets loss and the Bears loss. I had the Ravens Jets as my losses. Oh, you picked the Cardinals? Yes. I picked the Dolphins. Yeah, Dolphins choked in the end. You picked the Rams one? Yeah, I did. Why? Sean McVeigh is a good coach. I don't like to bet against him. And they got Cooper Cup and Pukinacua back Colby. I mean, not Colby Kenny. I'm not Colby, he's Colby. But yeah, that's a big difference though. Now you're mid like Colby. Wow. But yeah. Yeah, I'm going to be sure. I don't know Colby. I mean, I would be fine with the Ravens winning the division at this point though. What do you think about Jordan Love's injury again? They said it's a groin injury. They said there could be some concern. I don't know how much time he'll miss if he doesn't miss. I just hope he's OK. Yeah. But Colby, why would I cheer for the? I can't cheer for the Broncos. Broncos are in the wild card. The Ravens are leading the division. We need we're only we're not going to win the division. So we need wild card probably. Broncos country, let's ride. Broncos country, so that's that. Bonix. But yeah, you had some good games. Well, you obviously had the Browns Ravens game finish. You had the Patriots, Jets finish. I mean, my goodness, put the fries in the bag, Aaron Rodgers. Yeah, I don't really care about anymore. Yeah. I mean, it's just even though. It's just sad. I mean, he's two and six, dude. They have the same record as the Patriots, Kenny. That's sad. Even though I have Aaron Rodgers poster back there. Who is Colby? Rodgers or Bo? Yeah. Yeah, two and six is pathetic, dude. I mean, my goodness. What about that Cowboys 49ers game yesterday? Cowboys played a pretty good first half, but just kind of lost their focus in the second half. They I mean, they I mean, George Kittle added big game on Titan National Titans day. All those Titans scored yesterday. Tucker Kraft really good. Yeah. Big get the big play. I haven't been fantasy in one league. Oh, we're playing each other this week. I know I beat you. How did you get that point? Can Kenny went from Kenny went from the title winner, two time title winner to two and six. So. I I got admit I had a bad draft. Yeah, who do you draft? I can't even remember. I can look it right now. Yeah, overall eight out of 10. Yeah. I don't know what's wrong with my team. Because Baker Mayfield was on the bench. How did you get 183 points and 70 points and point 70? Yeah, I scored a lot of points. How did you get that money point? No idea. I had a bunch from CDLAM, I think. 40 points from CD. Yeah, the big game. Garbage time. I know. Yeah, I mean, I don't blame him for being happy about the Detroit Lions seven and one. So. Yeah, the Cowboys suck. Jack Prescott is buns. He got paid. You decided to suck. Hey, Packard's Lions this weekend. Are you excited for a game? Max, which game? Packard's Lions. That should be a good game. Well, when did they play? 425 Sunday. Where's the game at? Well, I'm picking the packers. I already know who Ken Dawgs picking. Well, I'm. Oh. This is first. This is Jared Gott's first game outside. He's here. Yeah. I'm a Kroger Malphan. Nick Bose is a beast, man. I love how we had the courage to actually. I'm. I love how we had the courage to actually wear a Trump hat. And like some people, they would, they're too scared to share their opinion, but he wasn't. But yeah. The next week of football, who does the brownies play this week? We play at home against the Chargers. Oh, I think we'll win. I don't think the Chargers have that great of an offense. OK, Packard's played Lions. Yeah. They'll come out either tomorrow morning or tonight. Colby, I haven't decided. My pick video usually come out Wednesday, but if I have time, I'll do it tomorrow. Yeah, keep the Chargers. Hey, what's your record is here? My record, I can't remember what my record is. I'm 82 and 40. 82 and 40. I can. No way. And I believe that. That's insane, dude. I don't know if I can believe that. Max. What? I want to present it. OK, let me see my record because mine's not even close to that. Can you allow me on the screen? Yeah, wait a sec. Or just one second. I wanted to see my record first. OK, I now it's now it's now I now it's kind of believable, I guess. What's your record? Minus 76 and 46. Followed on screen. 82 and 40. Wow. We're all whooping Robert and Pickham's in a Mirshaw. How's how's Rob doing in Pickham? Oh, I don't know. I know I know we had a lot of disagreements. So so I'm doing pretty good. Yeah. What's that worst week this year? What's your worst week? My worst week was week week two. I went seven and nine. I want eight and eight week two. Yeah. I want eight and eight week three. I'm going to check Rob's pick up this video on my computer. Seven and nine week four. And ever since week week four. Yeah. I've been smoking a ten and four. Thirteen and one. Twelve and three. Eleven and four. That's not bad. That is not bad. That would be cool to get Sean here. He's called in magic. So. Oh, Orlando Magic. Orlando Magic. Oh. Let's check Rob's pickums. So. Speaking of Orlando Magic. How's NBA doing lately? How do you even watching the NBA? Yeah, the Cavs are three and over. They're losing the night. Not surprising, though. At the. Three and oh. Yeah, the Cavs are winning right now, though. They're up 84 to 80. I'm going to put that game on. I was. Yeah, that's good. I'm going to put the Cavs on right now. Hopefully we can finish it off. Waker's sons at 10 o'clock tonight, Max. Yeah, I'm taking I'm taking the Lakers. They're good. They're back. They play the Cavs Wednesday. Oh. That should be a good game. Yeah. All right, let's check dirty Rob TV's pickums. Let's see what his record is. Captain Marys, I saw them ladies. On his Instagram. Hey, why are you dressed up as Halloween for Halloween? For me? Yeah, I have no idea. Not going to lie. What about you? What? Nothing. Nothing for 10 dog? Nope. Wow. Or should I do the real slim, shady? You could. Could you do the real slim, shady? Yeah. Too bad he's a common supporter. Yeah. Oh, well. Yeah, well. You know, I say Republicans are real country, a real America and Democrats are the fake America. Exactly. Yeah. Yes, sir. But yeah, overall Rob Rob's 10 and five. Wow. He had the Cowboys winning. I had the Cowboys winning originally, but I changed my picture before the others. You know what? So because George Kittle and Devo Samuel played or when it did go down, sadly, it's been down for a minute now. Who's that? Oh, I don't know. Kobe Kobe, lame, goatees, goatees. What's up, Daniel Barry? Going on, Daniel. Appreciate you being here, the newest member. She heard, man. So. I'll be here. So. Me and Max's birthday is coming up. Yeah, November 12th for me. November 18th for me. Steelers are stinking it up tonight. You know, hold on, I'm gonna meet us here, Max. How old? 21. 21. 21 is good enough. No more getting ID'd. I never did. I never had an ID. Ankeys were good. Screw the Ankeys. No, Kobe, it's. It's November is better than October. Right? November is better than October. Do you agree with me, Max? Yeah. Come on, Mitchell hit those. So. But, you know, I mean, the NFL. Oh yeah, we didn't talk about that Commander's Hill Mary. Oh. Tyree Stevens. Tyree Stevens and man, what are you doing? You should get suspended for a game by his team. Thought of Mitchell's point like, ass dude. What's it called? Uh, Jair Alexander got suspended by his own team. For doing something stupid. Right, Max? Yeah. If he, if. What's his face can do gets suspended for one game. Tyree's can get suspended for one game. While the Raptors are beating the Nuggets. That's a shock. The Nuggets are not good. I don't think they're that great either. How do you feel about Josh Jacobson Green Bay? I think he's done a good job this year. You know, I think he's a good fit for the offense. You know who would have been a real good fit for the Packers? Who? Your boy that put, I used to play for the TNS playing tonight. Xavier McKinney. Yeah. And then a good pick up. Yeah, I can't believe the Giants let him go, man. No, that's not true. Colby. I don't hate the Nuggets, bro. Hey, Per sources, Colby is mid. I don't hate the St. Louis Cardinals. I'd say Moseyloff needs to make better moves. What is the best? How do you, how do you feel about this NBA season so far? It's actually solid so far, you know, hopefully the Cavs can finish it off. Josh Hart is good though. The Lakers are back? Yeah, they might be. It's still early, but you know. Hey, LeBron Anthony Davis looks like an MVP type player so far this year. Yeah, he's look good. He might screw around with the MVP of the Westbrook Facts. Westbrook is mid, mid at best to be fair. Yeah. He's washed. I don't miss him. I don't miss him as a Laker. Yeah. You know, yeah, I've been, you haven't been with LeBron. LeBron days has not been a Laker at all. I've been a Cavalier in a long time. Yeah, it's been six years now since LeBron was with the Cavs. So. Greg Joseph does guy another points nine nine. Dude couldn't kick the last two weeks, but he's making everything today. It was 69. Now it's 99. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. 69 now is 99. Dean Wade is trash, dude. My goodness. Why is now like his brother, the Wayne Wade? I don't know. But he sucks. They're not late, right? Make America great again. Right. How do you make America great again? I've been, I want political commercials go away. Yeah. They're annoying. You agree with me? A little bit. I don't mind politics though. Oh yeah. Okay. Oh yeah. NBA is doing pretty good lately. How do you feel with the NHL seats and so far? I mean, I haven't watched a ton, but it's, you know, it's kind of. It does October. What I expected. It's October only. Yeah. The season far from over. How are the Detroit Red Wings doing? Four, form one. The Bruins are like four and four as well, I think or something like that. Or form one. Yeah. One, two, three, four, five teams are. Are tied for third place. Yeah. In the division. Is that crazy? Yeah. The season's far from over. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's back. It is back. Yeah. Ben carrow is about to have 50 possibly. There you go. Oh, what a three by Jerry Scarlin calves of two point league. Yeah. But yeah. So far, everything good. But yeah, you saw who died yesterday. Who died yesterday. Donovan. Jim Donovan. Yeah. He died two days ago. Yeah. Oh, sorry. That's okay. I'm better posting, but yeah, that was sad for you guys, right? It was sad. Yeah. The Browns won for Jim. Was he good? He was very good. Yeah. But yeah, so far, I'm excited for this week of football coming up. Yeah. Packers Lions. Howling night is. Howling night. It's gonna be a sad game. It's not gonna be a good game. New York Jets. Nobody cares. Put the fries in the bag Aaron. Put the fries in the bag. Oh, yeah. I think I'm picking the Texans to win. Me too. I don't think the Jets players care that much anymore. Why did the Bonnet one go from one bad team to one to another bad team? He needs Aaron Rodgers in his life for Rodgers. You know what? I don't give a shit anymore. Yeah. About that anymore. What don't you give a shit about? Aaron Rodgers and all that. Yeah. That's fair. Is that bad? I don't give a shit about that. No. They're not Packers anymore. He's been a smeller this year. He's a little bit better than he's made. Who's gonna get more interceptions this year? Aaron Rodgers. Not Aaron Rodgers. Jordan Love or Xavier McKinney? Oh, I don't know. But yeah, Xavier McKinney might be winning defensive player years so far. Yeah. Kenny? He could. I mean, he's been terrific, you know, interception after interception. He's been arguably the best safety this year. So I can't believe, I can't believe Jyveson resigned him. And he just walked, walked over the Lambo. Yeah. Dexel Lawrence been good this year. Nine sacks. Dexel Lawrence is really good. He might be good traded soon. I don't think so. I think he's a building block for the Giants. Kenny's gonna want him on the Packers. Yes, I do. Nine sacks for a defensive tackle already is crazy. You know I want everyone in Green Bay. Yeah. I want everyone in Green Bay. I want everyone in Green Bay. I want everyone in Green Bay. Yeah. I want everyone on the rounds. So except to Sean Watson. Do you want to show him? Yeah. Do you want to show him Watson on the Packers? If Jordan, something happens to Jordan Love? No. Green Bay Packers. You can have him. Like why you're to Sean Watson. You can have him for the rest of the year. Yeah. Jordan Love is your, is your hope and savior. It's our hope and savior. Yeah. You might be. Moig Wallace is good. I mean the thing is you could have had him. You could have to Sean Watson. I mean, he is a former pro bowler, you know, upside. Moig Wallace playing really well. With nothing to lose. Hey, he has nothing to lose. Moig Wallace. Oh yeah. Yeah. Moig Wallace is playing well though. He's a good player with the offense set up for him. How's college football going lately? What do you think about this week in the football after I come back and go back and quickly? Okay. Wait, I talked about college football and we can talk a little more when I come back. All right. Okay. So college football, let's go for the rankings. We're going to one still. Dylan Gabriel, the best quarterback in college football, not up for debate. I think came word is the best quarterback in football. It could be right. We're going to be able to better in my opinion. So yeah. Then you have a two. You have the Georgia Bulldogs who are the heavy favorites in the national championship again. Sadly, sadly, no humble pie for Uncle Lou. I wanted Uncle Lou to eat some humble pie really badly. Fortunately, he'll be eating my pie. So yeah. It'll be like, yeah, I thought just so. Even though he kept saying Georgia was barely a bull team like a couple of weeks ago, but that's kind of what it is. I mean, Ohio State Penn State this week, you know, you got Drew Rower. It's going to be a game time decision. You got broke, broke, broke, I think that's his name. I mean, I mean, interesting game. Whoever gets whoever loses that job should be, game should be fired immediately. Not even Jorling James Franklin, Ryan Day Penn State won't have a fire James Franklin though. Because Penn State, you know, they don't think they don't think they can do it with another coach. Ohio State is the resource more resources than Pennsylvania State University. So that's that. Yeah. So that's the big match of it noon with a Gus and Joel on the call. Goats, alpha males, as you can say. So that's kind of what we're working with here. Oh, in for the rears. There is Garland.

There are young team that wants to win football games They're a team that wants to go out there and do their thing to help their teammates the jets are the total opposite That's why I probably shouldn't have been on the bed on the packers I mean the packers yeah, I mean, of course they want to win the six and two But the but the jets you can tell those guys don't give it give a damn especially divante People are like divante wanted to go to the jets to win games Come on. He wanted to go to the jets to hang out with erin rogers and paddish stats. Let's be real You can tell by the body language. The guy doesn't care about winning. He wants money in stats So And he all in his taco bell commercials Hey, so I'm telling me there's a talk bell open that's for sale in what's it called Las Vegas? Oh, yeah I Told you just yep no culture at all none at all the near jets Well, yeah robber solid green Bay is really good. Patriots are just coming along It's like the lion's first one is a new team. Yeah, and that was without drake may either jacobi brisette played really well You know what? I noticed your offense of wine was Was very solid as well. I mean robber solid green bay the jets added a son reddick back and it just It didn't help at all. I mean it's just an everything. I think with the jets Especially on the defensive side of the ball and I saw a couple plays I watched a lot of that game sauce gardener just kind of just missed assignments here and there These guys just don't care, you know, I know robber solid green bay I mean max Yeah, I mean the patriots I just don't understand I mean Everyone's clamoring about this jets defensive line and how they got the song right back and they couldn't get any pressure on the Okay, I'm not What's up everyone? Well, yeah Oh man Couldn't get any pressure on the um On the um Patriots, so it's just You know, they they had a good game plan and it worked so But yeah, how do you feel all robber solid green bay helping out the practice It's interesting, you know, I think it'll help. I mean look at the look at Look at the um jets um Defense without robert solid now. It's been terrible ever since he fired Like I said firing a coach like that can ruin your culture. I mean those players love solid I don't care what would he I don't care what would he johnson thinks and whatnot, but the players adored solid They I mean that was that that wasn't a secret. I mean and it's just I think firing him just Let a lot of players to being distraught and it's just Is what it is Yes, sir But yeah, overall feel like it's gonna be a good year What's gonna happen rest of year with the with the stupid jets Jets nothing. I mean, they're just gonna have to ride it out. It's gonna be it's gonna be ugly the rest of the way I don't expect them to be the Texans not at all. They'll probably be two and seven Just gonna have to ride it out and rogers might you never know with rogers. He might He might cop out mid season like honestly And he'll go on pat mack if you and talk about it non-stop So who's on who's the backup for the jets? Um, I'm not sure I can't remember Okay Yeah They finish flowing the sands and that's we yeah, I mean I would not be stunned. I mean Yeah, I'm happy about rovers I didn't mention this either. Did you see the first quarter in that game the jets had to take all three other timeouts in the first quarter? Oh, yeah, I saw that I saw that I was like that was a big dumb That that that old bridge guy sucks and they have talked they Hello, what? That was dumb Yeah, I mean and when you're and when your two options for calling plays are Todd downing and Nathaniel hack it and Yeah It's pretty bad So overall that's dumb yep They're just poorly ran. It's they went all in and it didn't work out It's just poor absolutely piss poor from the New York Jets And I tried telling people last year that I was in high on the jets this year. I actually had to make in the postseason I actually kind of kind of turned around on them, but you know Hey max you forgot to predict our postseason What's that? What do you mean? At the beginning of the year we almost we forgot to do a prediction of the post and did we do that? Yeah, we did we did Oh, we had one the world series Now we're all serious. It's super ball. Oh, I had the I had the Texans being the 49ers All right. Oh, yeah, I had Packard beating what team I picked again Oh, I can't remember but oh, yeah If they wouldn't have taken those timeouts they would have had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter But they had 20 seconds to go only one timeout So they just screwed around You know just piss poor Players don't care before the season sauce Gardner was just going on Kicking twitch streams out of nowhere. I mean that that was another sign. I mean dudes hanging out with the freaking You know 12 year old You know type people. I don't know. I don't care but Yeah So that's kind of what you watch football game on. Are you excited to watch the Lakers game tomorrow? Tonight I meant you can watch them really good games tonight. Maybe We'll see. Cows are for no, though, Kenny Maybe the new york nicks on the road kenny Atkinson goat I'm the goat. Yeah, kenny Atkinson in Your So hey was it kenny Atkinson used to be a head coach of a team that yeah, he was 04 You know, he was the head coach of the brooklynettes Was it coach and oh for also? Yeah Lines lines winning the super organ's the bills Yeah Was it was that your preseason prediction robber? You're just the current updated prediction I still I'm still I'm still sticking with my preseason prediction the Texans are six and two the 49ers. Maybe they can get it going Yeah I don't know Trade deadlines next week. I don't expect major moves to happen. Maybe some moves here and there But yeah, I think preseason. Okay. I think I think the lions will add a pass rusher, but you know Maybe the Steelers were out of receiver. I don't know What are you doing the past? I don't know What did the Packers need Wow A rusher, maybe a dresser. It's an area Smith reunion No, why not? You can give us you can give us a first round pick Okay Mild scared. Okay. That's not happening You wish what would you know miles Garrett got traded? Um, I don't know I'd be pretty upset When max max debate go on a rage. Yep, I would In this yeah, that's what I heard Yeah, trade Hendrickson would be something I mean the Bengals aren't doing too hot They're own for at home now. I mean I picked the Eagles to win yesterday But it's just not the Bengals here that defense is just terrible. They got they need to They need to rehire new staff on that whole defense. I mean, it's just not happening. It's overdone overdue so and Yeah, I mean no T Higgins yesterday obviously hindered the offense. They got to pay the receivers too. It's just a really sticky situation And they don't have Brian Calvin Cal Calhans Cal Calhans doing a horrible job in Tennessee, but I think he's more suited for as an offensive coordinator And I think he had a good relationship with Joe Burrow. So The backers of like instead of Nothing nothing to the derriest. My funny was that green bag What do you mean they did nothing? He did nothing wrong We're friendly to the derriest man funny was in green bay. Yeah, he's a good player. I mean But why do you want me green day? The Browns would get something for him. Oh, I don't know money So Yeah, it's kind of what we're at right now Hissons lost again Are they own for now? Yep The Detroit Pistons are curious. I don't care who coaches that team They could have like the they could have an all NBA lineup and still finish horrible Like that's the I'm convinced the Detroit Pistons are just a curse franchise at this point Like there's no reason that team should be a one for right now. No I just don't get it Tobias Harris only had nine points tonight He paid a bunch of money Detroit players get offended when they don't get paid and get some way Yep, him hardware. He had 20 points tonight. Look at look at on Hasan Redick I mean, he came back. He's back now, but then look at um Jamar chase before the season started Brandon I youk. Yeah Oh Cooked franchise. Let's be real Oh, well, right. Oh, well, yeah, JB bicker staff former Cavs coach Who does the pissant who does the pissings play next I do not know 76ers on Wednesday Daniel Jones just took another sack But yeah, Wednesday's 76er the first versus the Pistons Yeah, what do you think of that max? I Think the sixers will win at this point. I don't know. Yeah, he's frustrated with the offensive line Brian Dabel That offense line is getting gashed in the second half Hey max, uh, Rob did the right decision on not doing this game Max Robby did right decision by not doing this game because this game is vast Um, the Steelers just got a punt return touchdown, but there's multiple flags on the field. So I don't know what's gonna happen here Well, I mean this game What's going to I'm a little score the MLB game? Well, I don't know this might come back It's gonna come back probably Nope, it's gonna do you touchdown for the Steelers. Wow I thought the punter got decked they didn't call it Unless they said he ran in the what the guy ran in there Let's see Wow, Alvin Austin Wow That's crazy that is Did he did he step out there? No not at all I'm surprised. Yeah Dammit Smith is incredible in this game max. You got some life in this game max. Yeah Who's that guy that was putting his finger down What guy That the coach that's the the nine and the 16 For the Steelers for the Steelers. Yeah. Oh, that's the special teams coordinator.
