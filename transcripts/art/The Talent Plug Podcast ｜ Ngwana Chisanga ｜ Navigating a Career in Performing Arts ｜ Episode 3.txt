 Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, wherever you may be watching us from. Welcome to the Talent Plug podcast, a space where we pretty much dive deep into different and varied career choices that individuals take up. I'm your host, Francis Malomban. In this episode, we've got a very interesting personality. She's a friend of mine, somebody that I have seen evolve over time. Her story is very interesting in the sense that, well, she'll talk about it. Yeah, but Gwana, thank you so much for coming through to the Talent Plug podcast. Really a pleasure to see you and have you. Thank you for having me. All right, so there is so much I want to ask you that I might skip the intro, which is the most important thing. So before we do that, let's just get into how, no, let's get into whom Gwana is. Tell us a bit about yourself. I always find it so hard to answer a question because I am a lot of things. I've come to realize I'm a lot of things. But recently someone, okay, one, I'll start. I'm weird. What do you mean by that? Okay, I think one person was actually brave enough to tell me like, you're so freaking weird, but it was like a good kind of weird. So I'm like, wait, and also I was in the face of my life where I was doing a lot of introspection. So I was like, I realized a lot of things about life. What do they mean when they said you're weird? So this is what I'm about to explain. I'm just different. And I think, I don't know why specifically, but on face value, someone will think, oh, they've clocked me. They know that she's like this. But when they get to know me, I could be like, not totally different, but just off of what they thought. So what? You've got split personalities. Maybe, but no, I think it's just, I don't fit. I don't like personally. I don't like feeling like a stereotype. Like I'm just resistant to that. If I could break out in hives, I would probably. But then I don't always like, I don't put it out there. I don't show up everywhere. Hey, I'm like, that's me. Exactly. Yeah. And I think it's only recently when I've started trying to do that intentionally, but obviously managed in a managed way. So anyway, so someone described me as weird. So I was talking to someone else, another person that I met and got to know. And I was like, I bet you think I'm weird. That's how weird I am. I'll ask you that. I bet you think I'm weird. You know, because I could tell like they were, you know, when you're getting to know people, you have your first impressions and then I easily break people's first impressions. That's another thing. So I could tell that they were in that space where they're like, I think this person is like trying to figure me out and they can't, you know. So I was presenting the opportunity to talk about it. Okay. Yeah. So then they were like, no, you're not weird. You're just free spirited and you're focused and you know what you want. And I'm like, for the first time, someone has described me in a way that I can agree. Yes. And in a way that that's particularly relevant at that time. Interesting. Yeah, right. All right. So yeah. Okay. Very, very interesting. So you've talked about the personality that you have. Just speak a little bit about the kind of upbringing that you had, because I pretty much want to understand how you've gotten to this level. So obviously you're bringing played a very pivotal role in shaping who you are right now. So can you just speak about that? Okay. So where can I start? Most of what I can see about my upbringing, it's stuff that I've like processed and realized as of going older, obviously. Right. So I grew up very curious. And I think I spent a lot of time alone. Right. Being an only girl. Well, it's me and my older brother. Right. Being an only girl. But I never, like I said, stereotypes. So I was always the little sister that's tagging along with my brother and he chased me. But I'll be like, I'm coming or I'll cry or manipulate you now. Last one. Last one like me. Yeah. Team last one. Yeah. So I grew up, I think people would describe me as a tomboy. Right. I enjoyed being outside. I enjoyed like being active, climbing trees and playing football. Right. But I was also smart. I would use my girliness, but it was convenient. So for example, if I'm losing at the game, and then I'll start I'm like, no, I said I did what exactly. Right. And then my brother is there. His friends are like my older brother. So it protects me as well, even if they're frustrated. So I grew up not just stereotypical girl and very early in my life, like getting just pretty adolescent face. I started realizing, Oh, I can't just be like a human girl and this boy. So I really struggled with that. Also, I think my parents and my dad specifically was very intentional about not, how can I say, not enabling society to define you like, okay, yeah, so yeah, a girl and you play with dolls and whatever. So it was very intentional about that. I remember specifically he would like the toys that I had were like gender neutral. I only had one door and it was the door. It was just there for some times. Yeah. I didn't relate to like, you know, having a door for me, I would rather have had like a door that has organs and what and I can open it up. But it had it had brown skin. It had brown skin. Yeah. So that was also very intentional because I think he didn't want the whole, you know, right, right, right. Funny story. I used to run out. Well, there's one time my brother's friends, younger sister, wait, should I tell this story? Anyway, I don't think they're listening. I don't think they're listening. But so there was a thing where now I'm getting into adolescence. So, like my aunties and my mom and I think this is what I concluded, right? Where now making an effort to say, actually tell my brother like, don't take her with you because now, you know, she's like getting into like, you know, a girly age and we want her to stop playing with boys. So if anything, find your friends, sisters, I wanted to play with her. So one of the girls came over. They organized a play date for me. But I have my own idea. And I don't like telling me what not to do. Right. So she came over. I gave it a chance. I didn't really know what was happening. This is all like in hindsight when I figured out that that's what they were doing. But I was like, Okay, fine, fine, fine. Let her come one time and get off my back and move on back to my sports. So she came over and she had like this Barbie, like a play set and and like tea. Yeah. Like I'm just like, this is not for me. Like I'm gonna play cooking. I would like go and get a mini meal from the house. Right. And I would cook, feed me and my crew like raw stuff. Someone got sick at some point. So then she came over and I literally ran away from her. Like I went to lock myself in my room. And then I remember the help at the time had to come and look for me like the chick was outside waiting. I was just like, I can't play with I can't like I can't do this. It was at that point you realized this is not for me. So yeah, needless to say, I think my brother was very ashamed. And he was he I think he understood because he understood me and he's also very protective of me. Right. So yeah, but I think it's the the efforts of the adults were just failing. Right. And I remember at some point was like a big, big struggle until I went off to boarding school. So yeah, but yeah, I that's how I grew up, I guess. I don't know if you want to know anything else. That's that's pretty much decent. Thanks so much for sharing. So I think something that was skipped was pretty much just highlighting the journey and the transitions that you have made throughout your your upbringing and obviously part of the other hood as well. I'd like for you to just speak into how your journey has evolved over time. So kindly just run us through how you started out in terms of the professional setup, what you studied and what you're ultimately doing right now. Okay, so relating like to my upbringing, one thing I forgot to mention is my dad was always an entrepreneur. Right. Like, I remember he worked like for Paris State or something. I don't know one word. Anyway, a government something, right, for a bit. And then after that, like he went into music business. Right. Yeah. So for the longest time, I've always known him to be an entrepreneur and obviously starting out back then. Yeah. Selling music, essentially music, right related products. It was a new thing. So at some point, like in the beginning, family was involved, like every employee was the family member. Right. And we like, I remember when the first shop was open, we had to go and paint and da, da, da, da, funny story. I ate styrofoam and got sick and poisoned ourselves, me and my cousins. I was like, they're just like corn puffs. We had to look for so ish. It was a problem. Hold it being hands on your hands. Exactly. And I was so curious. Right. And I believe like, you couldn't tell me anything like you don't answer my question, all the more reason to go and figure it out myself. Right. So you're better off answering my question. Yeah. You know, but anyway, yeah. So I always that sort of rubbed off onto me. And it was just the natural thing for me that, oh, when I grow up, I am going to be an entrepreneur. I'm going to do my own thing, run my own business and that sort of thing. So I grew up with that. And then even when I went to uni and did like a degree, I always had that in mind. Right. So it's sort of just been with me. So what did you study? Marketing. Oh, interesting. Why that career choice? For the specific reason that by that time, I'd realized by the time it was time to go to uni, I'd realized that I need to be doing something that I love doing, something that I'm interested in. But where I was, I mean, where we're from, like in Zambia, and especially at that time, I would have, if I would grew up in a different environment, like in the western environment, for example, I probably would have been in an art school, a dance school, music school, something. So who influenced that decision to study marketing? It was myself. Oh, nice. Yeah. Because so why, why didn't you pursue those those fields? You just, I didn't know it was an option. I didn't know it was an option because I didn't know that I would be able to go even like I went to UCT, University of Cape Town, and they actually have a school of dance. But I didn't know until I got there. So I grew up thinking, okay, I'm probably going to go to UNSA, one of these places. Then I started looking at my options, like, I don't know if you remember, but I actually left in Palembe in grade 11, first term, because then I started seeing, like, there are options to go and study abroad and what you need to do that. So I left because I wanted to do A-levels and condense my program so that I don't get into university too late. Right, right, right. Yeah. So all that was, like, me realizing that those were actually possible options. And then out of all the options I had in terms of my grades and what I could be accepted in, marketing was like the closest thing to, like, being creative and being free. Like, for me, I've always had a thing about I need to be free. Yes, I need to be free. I need to be free to be me. So I think I mean, there's only one you. Exactly. Yeah. So that was like, I knew I had nothing like an accountant. Like, even if I did those things, I'm sure I would do it in a way where I was still able to, like, integrate something that's uniquely me. I just didn't want to feel like a robot. Right. Interesting. Yeah. So that's how I ended up marketing. Okay. So you started marketing. You get your degree. What transitions from there? So I got to a point where I had to figure out, okay, after my degree, am I going to try and stay on in SA and, like, build a career because the stream was there and, like, I've built, somewhat built a life there, or come back home. Yeah. And what are my options? Me coming back home, I knew I wasn't going to stick with marketing. Staying in SA, I would have. Right. But then I listened to my heart a lot. So I think my heart just told me, like, this is not home. And it's also the, I mean, the corporate life is the corporate life. So I also got to realize that Is it boring? I also got to realize that. You know, like, I'm getting to it. I'm getting to it. Right. So I got into marketing thinking, we're going to be doing creative things all day, making ads, learning graphics, like, no, no, no, no, no, no. You sit in pitch meetings, you do administrative work, like, all that is, all that is an aspect of it. Wonderful as it was. There's a lot of, like, even just going through the degree, like, it opened my mind a lot and allowed me to see the possibilities. And not just in marketing, like, in the business world in general. But then I figured out you cannot escape the business. So even as an, as I realized the amount of work that would have to form a work that needs to be done. So I said, if I'm going to do this formal work, I'd rather do it in my own terms. Exactly. So it's not boring. But it's just not my thing. So it's not your thing. Very clever. It's just not your thing. Yeah. Okay. Interesting. So, so did you, did you do some corporate work? Like, before you transitioned into something that's like more you? Yeah, I've actually had technically five jobs. Okay. All of them in line with marketing. First one was like a small marketing business. Right. I did a lot of administrative work. And that's the thing, like, for you to climb the ranks, to get to a point where you're feeling like you, you can make a choice and have more stuff done on your own terms. It's a process. So I'd rather go through that process building my own customized thing. So anyway, so it was a small deal of administrative work. Then I got into the family business, right? Administrative work. Under marketing, but administrative work. No, actually, I went to Airtel first. Okay. But yeah, I went to Airtel. So from a small company to a big corporation. Then after that, I went into a family business. Then after that, I went into, I don't know, but yeah, something in entertainment. Is it three or four? Well, four. Yeah. Anyway, just about there. Okay. So now you get to your fourth or fifth job. What was that one thing that made you realize, you know what? I am not going to do this anymore. And I'm just diving into my own thing. Was there a specific incident? Was there something that triggered that? I wouldn't say there was something specific, but especially at that time, it was sort of, it's that thing where I'm like, okay, I've gotten out of the forest. So I'm not lost anymore. I'm much more clear about what I want, where I want to go. So even that other job was a part-time job. It was like working with, it was an NGO. And so it was working with Airtel and that sort of thing with them. But I still ended up in admin. So I'm like, this again. This again, right? So it just validated for me that you need to go, like this path is pretty set. No matter where you go, it's pretty set. So it just cemented for me, like, use this as a springboard for your next job. Okay. Interesting. So for those who may not know the kind of transition that you have had from your formal training, can you just speak into what journey you then decided to travel post that? Post what? Post the corporate or the admin. So the corporate has been happening in and out. Because even while I was doing that, I was still strategically thinking, how am I going to use every opportunity that I have, the benefit of a stable job, how am I going to use it to get me as comfortably and as conveniently as possible into what I really want to do. But then the difficulty with that is that it's not sustainable to be straddling the fence. So I would find that, for example, I wouldn't work towards a promotion because I'm like, anytime now, you get so then that affects the amount of, I guess, resource or benefits that you get from doing the stable job. So at some point, you have to commit to something. So it was always a game of like, yeah. So even the formal jobs, it was like in out, I spent like a few years working, then I go and try my own thing, come back to it. So yeah. And also because I was very unsure and I'm going through life, like different phases of life, where family is like, why are you really doing? Why did you leave that job? Why? Like, why are you making all up in your face? Yeah. And you can't explain the I've got a hunch that something will pop off outside of them. Like you can't explain that, right? So it was difficult. It was very difficult. So the decision to go into what I'm doing now specifically didn't come like at a moment. It's been like a buildup. And I don't think it could have been done otherwise, because there's a lot that I learned from being in formal employment that's helping me now to manage myself when I've been able. Interesting. And it's not that I didn't commit. So I was always committed to making that full time transition. Right. Right. It's just how the conditions needed to align. Right. Right. Okay. So you say you've been in and out of that space. I want you to just speak into the aspect of when you entered the arts, like full time, when you were just like, okay, this is something that I want to do now. And I will devote everything that I have. I'll devote my energy to just making sure that this kicks off. Like, what did you start with? And how did that journey then move on to where you are right now? Okay, so my first entry into the arts was with dance. And it actually, I made that decision when I was in my last year of university. Right. Because by that time, I had spent like about a year and some months, almost two years, training with a dance crew. Right. Yeah. So they like, they happened upon me one time and then they're like, oh, you're really talented. And that's without going too much into the, because that story is actually a very significant one. It took just one person to look me in the eye and say you have something special and it sparked. Right. Like, I can, even to this day, I remember that day, I can remember where I was standing, you know, so it's like something sparked in me. Yeah. And then spending time training with them. I realized these people pay their rent from dance. Right. They, you know, they're building like their careers. And this is what I wanted. It was, it felt like home, like, oh, this is what I've been searching for. Yeah. You know, so when I, when I experienced that, that's also part of what prompted me to come back home. Right. Because I'm like, here's an opportunity. Yeah. But in my thinking, the opportunities are much more vast there, don't you think? But it's not home. Okay. It's not home. And then also, I think that's just part of my purpose. Like, I love to teach. I love to share. Like, I'm not the type of person who'd be like, Oh, guys, there's a plug this side. I found this. Right. Right. Right. I'm not type of person, I think. So I was like, I can go back home and also I'm a homebody. I think it's also just my personality. Like, I love being at home. I love traveling. Yeah. By love being able to come back home and spend time and ground myself. So that's what I wanted to do. And I took it as an opportunity to say, okay, I can take this dance thing that I've learned here and build. And I was, I was convinced. I don't know how the world works. Right. So I was like, I'm going to go back to Zambia and immediately I'm going to hit the ground running and boom, we're gone. It's gonna blow. Hey, I came back and I saw flame. Flame. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, but I still decided because for me, I took it as an opportunity. Like, if there's nothing like this in Zambia, let me be the one to bring it. Yeah. Right. So that one I committed to that was my first time I committed like this is what I want to do. So even as I was going through the corporate jobs, I started with because I was like, okay, dance is not like a well established base or industry or even community took me a while to get to get to find like other dancers. Right. So I actually started with a modding agency because a while back, I had done like a model training thing and that was big at the time. It was in the free space. I call these things, I don't call it like in the table, but it was a free space where you get to set your, your standards and not such a standard, but work on your own terms. Right. Yeah. So that's what I started with. But the intention was always to get to dance. Like dance has been a thing that's been like pulling me, it's been like my notestar. So, so is it something that you do up loving or is it because of the one interaction you had with, with the person you just talked about? The interaction sparked it. But I remember when I was in high school. Right. I think I was depressed. Who dumped you? No, not even. Not even. Let's not even start talking about things from high school here because there are people watching. So let's just leave it at that. But I think I was depressed. I only realized like when I introspected and looked at my life, but I think I was depressed. So I remember I had a habit of I called like I would get into like this gray space. Right. And I think I was like numb to a lot of things, but probably people wouldn't tell you know. But I think I was numb and I spent a lot of time in my head and then I would feel like I think I've just felt let me just say I feel numb and what I would do is I would dance in my head. That's deep. Yeah. I would, I would be like this dark space. Most of the time, like I was in a spotlight and I was probably wearing like white white stuff and I was dancing and I can't tell you what type of dance I was doing. But the only thing I can liken it to now when I've known about dance is contemporary dance. And it would be so I think what I was also doing was sort of like meditating and going into that space. Right. And that helped me a lot. So even when I went to uni, how I ended up in dance, again, I listened to my, I listened to my intuition a lot. Right. I would love a lot less than I would love to, but I realized I actually do listen to it a lot. So when I went to uni, like in my second year or so, I was the contribution hit me again. But this time I was aware of it because I was going through some stuff. Yeah. And something just told me you need to be active. You need to be active. So I looked around for different societies. I ended up in a cheerleading society that only lasted two weeks. I mean, I ended up in a dance society on campus. And that's where I met an external person who was looking for dancers for like an amateur music video. And boom, the rest is history. So something just kept pushing me like just go and look for something active to do. And when I started dancing, I that feeling came back. Right. That soothing feeling of like when I would be in my head, but now I'm actually experiencing it like awake. Yeah. I was like, there's something here in liberation. Yeah. There's something here. So that that's so I can't say I had a thing for that. Yeah. Then I met an old, I think it was a primary school, schoolmate of mine. Yeah. That had been seeing me posting dance. Right. Right. And they're like, you were always a dancer. I don't like what? Yeah. No, you remember then I actually remember that there was a time I was like choreographing people. Yeah. And this was like as early as fifth grade. Then he started remembering that. Then I started remembering like, oh, this thing has always been in my life. So for me, it's more than just a super special thing. It's really like a spiritual thing. Interesting. Spiritual, right? Yeah. Nice. Nice. Nice. Okay. So now you talked about how you came back to the NBA, right? And how in your mind you were like, look, when I go back and do this, I'm literally like you had it in your mind how the whole thing was going to play out and how you're going to blow. Yeah. What happens from there? So I came back and then they were not that but you yeah. And then like I tried looking for some and I found like just one or two. Yeah. But they were doing something completely different. Yeah. And you know, like it's like being exposed to Olympic level, not Olympic level, but it was more advanced, right? People are playing that rent. Yeah. Yeah. True dance. Yeah. And then you come back here and then it's like ground zero. Yeah. Yeah. So I was like, I felt bamboozled. I even thought about going back. It's not too late. You know, but then something has always been pulling me like I said, for me, it's actually spiritual. So there's a lot of my life that's destined to be lived through dance. Right. And it's also tied to a lot of other people. Yeah. I've tried like even all those nine to five. Right. That's me trying like to get away. But then it just pulls me back. So I came back and then I remember I linked up with a cousin of mine who was teaching like salsa and then that's another thing like my brother and my cousin, they were into like the salsa world because I was like the dance thing that was biggest. Other than like rumba and traditional dance, I think the salsa was the salsa Latin ballroom type dances were the most common ones. Yeah. So I was like, okay, let's just go close enough to this. And then he was a DJ and did wedding choreography. Yeah. So I'm like, okay, close enough. So everything that I would end up doing, okay, this is close enough. This is close enough. But not quite. Not quite. Yeah. So that's how I ended up also joining him. And then I was like, oh, I'd like to try out teaching. I think I can teach that. So that also prompted me to like, you know, get my teaching skills and everything is self taught. That's the beauty about the freedom. But it's also the burden at times. Right. So yeah, that's I just said, okay, let me focus on doing this. And also I think because everything was like, you can do anything because there's nothing right, right. That also gave me like some fulfillment. Yeah. When it wasn't stressing me out. So speaking of the mentorship aspect, you've just talked about how you pretty much went into something without any form of guidance. Has that shaped who you are right now? Or do you feel that if you had somebody to pretty much hold your hand, things would have been fast tracked in terms of where you would be right now. How has that played out? Like having somebody like like starting out some something without having someone hold your hand. I think I've never been that type of person. And most of my most of my teachers or teachings, right, come out of like a challenge like, oh, so you think I can't do it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I think even if I had something like that, that's why I don't even I'm not even so stressed about not going to dance school, because dance school would have sort of cement programmed my mind that this is how it's done. Right. I love being like, how else can I do it? Yeah. Yeah. You know, so I think for me that wasn't an issue. It was very freeing, though there are times where I was like, I wish someone could check out me. What do I do? Because then you make mistakes. But then it's a learning experience. And then again, my ability to say, okay, this is an opportunity for me to be that for someone else. So even as I'm learning, I learn to teach. But I also I also feel like the spiritual side of things is in my DNA to like teach my older brother is a teacher, my grandparents were teachers, even my dad has like a lot of that teaching thing. You know, so like, even when you talk about the music business, even when you bring home like CDs and whatever, and that was new at the time, you're moving from cassettes to CDs. And then I would be there like, how does this work? I'll be so confused. I'm like, what is it? Like you break it down. Like, you know, I think the teaching thing is in my blood. So for me, it was it worked out. It worked out. Interesting. Interesting. So you ventured into dance. And you say that was the introduction to the arts. What then did you transition into in terms of just exploring what is out there within the art industry? So I have to say, like, for me, I never looked at it like the art. It was just like the obvious thing. Right. It was just it was just the way I and unfortunately, I thought everybody lived like that. Yeah, yeah. Like I thought everybody just followed their heart. Yeah. And this is supposed to be though. You know, so for me, it wasn't it wasn't a focal point. Like, I'm going into the arts. For me, it was always the feeling. Just being and doing me. Yes. Yeah. Like with the even with the fashion thing. I love fashion, you know. And I was just willing to try everything for as long as it felt good. Right. Right. Yeah. And as long as obviously the conditions were that's liberating. So I want to speak into film now, because you pretty much transitioned from from dance to film. How did that transition come about? So anyway, long story short, I decided to do a masterclass with Kazadi films. I think that was the first masterclass, I think. And then but I actually went there to try and network. Yeah. Because I just my contract was in renewed in the last job that I was doing. So I was like, Okay, what am I going to do with my time? And where am I going next? Right. And it wasn't intention. It wasn't actually intended to transition into something else. So it's just like the stream we've been going on. Yeah. How can we build on it? Right. Right. So for me, it was more about dance. But also, like I said, I don't focus on the arts as arts and I don't categorize them as dance. For me, it's expression. It's the feeling is just different plates you use. So you use dance, you use film, you use fashion, you use podcast, you use public speaking. Yeah. So for me, it's one and the same. So I was just like, how can I just enrich my journey? And my intention was to find something more stable and structured. Right. So I realized, okay, I need to network. And also, it was the phase of my life. I was personal life that I was in, I had hermited for a while. Right. So I was trying to get myself out of it. So I'm like, okay. Let me just go to things that will allow me to meet up because I know like with dance, people are recording all the time. Yeah. You know, so I was I was just trying to meet industry people so that I can get more access to more structured yeah. So that was my intention. I was just going to network and learn a new skill. Heck, what like you know what I mean? Yeah. So that was my intention. And then, lo and behold, I got feedback that you're a really good actress. So I was like, ah, me? Yeah. So again, it felt good to me. And I'm like, let me try this. And also, I've always had an interest in, in acting, right? And even in dance, there's elements of that. So for me, like, that's what I'm saying. It's one in this. It is no distinction because yeah, like you just pretty much. Yeah, I get your point. So, so you get into this space, which is pretty much natural, like you're saying it's not even a transition from one element to another. Do you feel that you've gotten to the point where you're not fulfilled? No. Okay. But I've gotten to a point where I feel, I feel more at peace with even the instability, right? Of it. So I feel like no matter what, I'm good. Oh, I'm going to be good. So I might not be good now, but that clarity about who I am, what really makes me at peace, right, is sharper. It's more stable. Like I'm more stable within myself. So I wouldn't say, and I think fulfillment is eternal. So once you're fulfilled in one thing, you get unfulfilled with being fulfilled. Right. And then you just want to see what's out there. Exactly. Yeah. Interesting. So you know, you've talked about these two elements. And my thinking is, whenever somebody would want to venture into something that looks like it's going to bring them fulfillment, yet doesn't sit well with the general populace. It's something that people usually just like shelf. They would rather hide. How did you get the courage to get in this place? I think it comes from not to sound esoteric and everything. It comes from my so blueprint. Okay. Okay. I have always been that person. I was even saying that kid that's like, why does this happen? You don't pay attention. Right. Right. So that's just it. Like, anytime someone says, oh, you can't do this. I'm going to ask why and I'm going to figure it out as long as I'm interested enough. Right. Right. So if I'm interested enough already by default, I'm taking it on. I don't even know if the balls come from somewhere. I just have them. But that's like it actually that excites me. Right. To be like, Oh, you think I can't do this. But it's not even like a personal thing. It's more like, I just believe that's how everyone should be kind of. And I certainly believe like that's how I am. So but I'm like, no, but you can't tell me that I can't do that. Let me show you. But I don't do it for them. It's like a personal, a personal task that I feel I have to prove to myself and in proving to myself, I know other people will see it. And the people that are meant to interact with that, engage with that, integrate that for themselves, who see it. Because that's also how it's been done for me seeing other people like defy the odds and be different. Those are the people that drive me. Those are the people that I watch. Those are the people that are inspiring to me. Right. Interesting. So you know, Gwana, it's, it's, yeah, like I've always told you your journey is very interesting. And, and I find it very interesting because it's very unorthodox in terms of we have our minds are sent growing up, your parents are going to tell you what, what, career choices they should make. The moment you deviate from that is you're, you're, you're perceived to be an outcast or they'll look at you in a certain kind of way. Did you get that negative vibe from your family or people close to you? Yes. Yes. And yes. Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I did get a lot. I feel like I even still do. But I think what happened and what I usually tell like other, because I mentor a few dancers. Yeah. And I have mentored some knowing and unknowingly, because also in the dance world, another unorthodox, an orthodox thing is that a girl, your age, right, the style that you're doing shouldn't be doing this right. So what I usually tell them and it's because I went through it myself and had to get myself to do it, right, is when you let go of that and when you just put your foot down and say, I don't care what anybody else says, right, other people will conform to you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And those who don't conform will stay far enough away from you that they won't engage you. And if they do, you will be unmoved if you truly are like standing in your truth. Yeah. So eventually it dies down. It's not sustainable when you know who you are and when you just decide. Interesting. So that's, it literally just took that to be like, I don't care. It's a process because there's different layers. You know, there's like, I'm broke. Why do I keep trying to do this thing? I am broke. Yeah. I'm sure the kind of investment that you put in it as well is, I mean, it has to show at some point, because it's not only the time, it's not only the spiritual connection that you have with it, but there's also finances involved. Because if you have a baby and you want to see something grow out of what you're doing, there's a lot of stuff that goes in it. But I want to also just speak into, you know, what makes somebody successful at what you're doing? Because I do realize that obviously, you need to have the formal, well, I don't know if you need to have the formal education, because we just talked about doing something even without going to school for that. But I just want to speak into, if somebody is trying to get into this space, is there a blueprint that they should follow other than, you know, just the passion that they have? I would say the blueprint is know thyself. Okay. That's it. Because anything else is not in your control. Right. So if you're going to go and swim where the current is unpredictable, you know, creatures that you never could have imagined or dreamed of would come at you, then the only thing you can bank on is you. So through whatever phase you're of the journey, you always, the only grounding thing, the only stable thing, the only thing you can rely on is you. And you won't always know you. It's up and down. You feel like, oh, I know me tomorrow, something happens. They're like, wait, was that me? Right. But that should always be like your North Star. That should always be like your blueprint. Like does this, when I put me and what I know about me so far, gaps and everything, shadows, bad-sided, everything, you have to also be real with yourself. When I put it over this thing, is it aligned? So for me, the alignment has always come with, has always been confirmed with the feeling. Like it used to be so ridiculous. I couldn't even say to people, but now I say it proudly because that's the one thing that has helped me. How does this feel? That's it. How does this feel? And then that informs everything, like whether it's a logical decision, whether it's an emotional decision, and you learn because that's how life is. I don't think there's a blueprint for life. So there's definitely no blueprint. Like even if you were in accounting, there's no guarantee that it's going to work out exactly as the conventional blueprint lays it out. So speaking into Zambia and where we are currently in terms of maturity, how, at what level do you think we're at in terms of the arts? I think it's growing. I think it's growing for me. Like if I focus on the dance community or industry, definitely where it's at now is where I thought it was when I came fresh from uni. And I'm like, this is where we're going. So for me, it's bittersweet as well that this is where it is now, but everything happens as it should for a reason. So with that, I feel like everything just has its own journey. I really don't try to attach to the idea of it's supposed to be. Because if it was supposed to be, it's what's happening. So if it's happening, that's what it's supposed to be. And it's for a reason. So you just need to find what's your place in that? How are you interacting with what is going on now? Does it frustrate you that the maturity levels in the industry are not where they're supposed to be? And does that sometimes make you feel like, you know what? Is this even worth doing? Because I mean, in my mind, my vision is we should be. I know you've talked about just appreciating where you currently are. I'm not thinking so much like where we should be. But if you've got a conception in your mind, it's probably frustrating if it's taking ages to get to where you're supposed to be. Does that frustrate you? So back to what I said. Like I really don't believe in supposed to be. So yes, I do get frustrated. Yes, I'll have like my ideas and my ideals. Because it's also about perspective. You know, like for some people who had a different experience, let's say, I'll use dance as a reference, who had a different experience to mine. Where it is now is like, oh my God, and that's their experience. And it's valid. Where is it? Maybe I need to understand where it is right now. Where is it? It's where it's supposed to be. But no, so I want to answer your question. So it does get frustrating. It's a moment type of thing. And there are times where it's like really great. So for me, I think my default when I'm really struck now, I've learned something I've learned my default. And I'm really struggling with something when I'm feeling like I'm forcing why I want I where I want to be and all of that. I'm just like, what do I need to know from now? Because when you figure out now, the closer you are, the faster you get to where you think you're supposed to be. So for me, I think that that I call it the conversion rate, right? Of realizing that has become shorter and shorter and shorter. So I don't like to stress right about things that are there to stress, especially when there are other things that I can choose to focus on, that I have better use of my energy. Interesting. Let's talk money. The perception out there is this specific area, dance, is pretty much very young in our, in our context or in our setup in Zambia. It's very, very young. And so you will make money out of it. So people shy away from it, not because they're not passionate about it, but because they feel it's not sustainable. Can you just speak into that? Is it an area that would bring satisfaction both in terms of what you're passionate about, as well as something that is sustainable for you? That's a heavy question, because I'm now thinking back to all the different answers I have for that, depending on where I am. But for now, I think it comes down to even, I think what I would have wanted to say, the previous question, is that you determine what success is to you. So for a lot of people, and it's normal, I've been through that phase as well, where success is resources, finances, you know, these world standards. But you gotta eat, you gotta be on that. So you make decisions and you live with them and you live with the consequences and you learn and you move. So I think... So my question is, is this decision paying off? For me? Yes. Financially? No. Honestly, no. But also, at a certain point, I decided to not do dance for commercial purposes. And that was intentional. So for some people, because they are a measure of success, is how commercially profitable something is. They will go for that and they will pursue that. But I reached a fork in the road, I guess, where I had to decide, do I go the commercial route or do I just focus on a different way? Of course, with my track record, I focus on a different way. Not that I don't want to make money out of it, but how I make money is very important to me. Okay. And if I'm not making money in a way that feels good to me, ultimately, it even affects my work. Deliverables. Exactly. Interesting. Yeah, that's very ethical of you to stick to the part that you feel is insane. So look, you speak about how, at the moment, this is something that is not bringing in the amount of finances you would want. So what's your motivation to keep going? Because I know what I'm building. And I'm playing the long game. There's a guy called Gary Vee, Gary Vaynerchuk. I used to listen to his stuff a lot. I've listened so that I don't necessarily need to listen to new stuff because his message is the same. And from him, I got validation about or clarity about why I operate the way I do. I'm a long game type of person. I find comfort in that. Like I said, oh, okay, that was mentioned off camera, but I love process. Right. So even the commercial thing, it became so, like, you know, I'm sure you heard of, like, maybe even, let's say, what example can I give? Maybe sports, when they focus too much on the commercial, it affects their ability to deliver in the actual technical side of the game and what the game is about. So I started experiencing that. And I realized that I'm not a, I'm not the type of person that can sustainably do that for a long period of time. Like, I love the process. I love the self discovery that happens. So when you're just, you know, checking out stuff for numbers, for money, for me, it gets old really quick. And it negatively affects me. Right. Yeah. And I think it just doesn't align with my purpose for an extended period of time. And it's not my thing. That's real. That's real. Yeah. So I've always played the long game. So even now, I know, and that's where even the, the time spent in companies, because companies don't like, like I worked in Airtel. Airtel didn't just register today and all of a sudden it's as big as it is. Right. You know, so I've learned, even seeing my dad build this company from where it was, it's no longer existing now, but it's, it was successfully existing for 25 years. Right. Right. So 25 years is a long time. I've only been doing dance officially for like 15 years. Right. Yeah. So I know, I, I know where I laid the bricks. I know the foundation and the intention was always to get to the long game. Interesting. Yeah. So let's, let's just speak a bit about, about film. I know it touched on it a bit. Tell us about your journey in film. So my journey in film, did I mention the masterclass? Yes. After I did the masterclass, I was like, okay, I think let me try and do this. And it came at a perfect time where I was like looking for something else to either elevate with the dance like significantly or just go into something different and obviously something that will supplement each other because my, my intention is actually to have a trifecta of dance, film and music. Okay. Yeah. So I've always been working towards that and depending on the opportunities that come, I push in one direction. You know a lot of the music you sing? I sing. Okay. I don't sing like Whitney Houston. Let me just put it out there. You know, I hesitate because there's always this standard. If you sing, then they'll ask you to sing and then I, you know, I, I can sing and also I'm someone who believes I can do anything. That's what even got me with dance. I'm like, I can see that I'm a human being. I've got limbs and I understand enough. I can do that. I can, if it takes me 10 years, if I want it enough, I can do it. So even with singing. And you have perfected your craft. Like I, when I see the clips of you dancing, I'm like, how does she even do that? Right? Yeah. Yeah. So for me, my attitude, especially with like my older years, in fact, it's been throughout, you can do anything. So it's just how long are you willing to take to get there? Right. Right. And even are you willing to take the risk of not actually getting there, but knowing that you going through that process is going to sprout so many other things that you even have no idea. You might find yourself on the moon. Yeah. You know, you started through singing, then you meet Elon Musk or whatever. I don't know, but it's something, you know, so I'm a person that believes in that. So I can sing. I don't have the greatest like voice. I'm not with Houston, but I can sing. I've tried out, you know, some people have heard me, whether they were just lying or not, down for it, but I'm going with it. Is this something that you want to explore? Yeah, I have started actually. I've talked to a few people. So like I said, I'm a long game. You were collab. I'm a rapper. Oh, really? I also rap. I also rap, but I don't do like free. I'm not yet at freestyle level, but I write. Okay. Yeah. So even with singing, I write. I've written a few songs actually. We are not going to play them today. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So that transition is very interesting. So you get into film like after the masterclass and everything, you, when did you then realize that, oh, okay, I can actually do this. On a large scale. Yes. It just happened to be honest. Like it just happened. Like most things, I set an intention in like internally, like, oh, this is what I want to do. It would be nice. Oh, I wonder, you know, and then my energy just goes towards that direction. Yeah. And when an opportunity comes, I gravitate towards it. Yeah. Also, depending on how excited I am by it, I'm like, Oh, I think there's something here. So I'll move maybe faster towards more intentionally towards it. So even with film, I went to masterclass and then it was like, Oh, it's something you can do. So I started going back to things that I used to do before, like where I would, like when I watch a movie, I would sit and I think, what would it take for me to pull off this character as authentically as this person? I wouldn't think what would it take to act? Yeah. For me, it was, what would it feel like? What would, how would they do it? Right. And I would try it out. Like, okay, out. And it would just come out of interest of whatever character or the movie or the story. Yeah. So that's where it came from. So now when I'm like, Oh, I think I can actually, like someone has actually confirmed for me, because when you're doing it by yourself, you're like, am I really, maybe I'm just guessing myself, you know? And so when it was confirmed for me, then I'm like, okay, I think let's try this more intentionally. So now I start actually going on YouTube, bless YouTube, the University of YouTube. And I'm like looking at stuff and trying out different things. And also even realizing like, in the masterclass, I wasn't completely lost, like because of dance again, like editing my own videos and what I understood things like color grading and that I might not know them on like a professional app, but I know them on on Capcats or whatever. So I understand the basics enough that I can even see, okay, I'm more interested in this and less of this and but I was generally interested in everything. So from then, for like a few months, I gave it maybe even just a month, actually, I gave it a try like so I looking for, I didn't even look for editions, it just started popping up. And the beauty of social media is that when you search something, for example, on YouTube, now all of a sudden there's a connection or something pops up on your Facebook or whatever. So yeah, I started seeing things and started following them up. And I didn't even do that many. And that's where the spiritual side of things come here. Like when you are good with yourself, what you need just comes to you without like fighting for it. So I did like an online audition for something. And then I even missed the deadline. So I know my video was bad, but I just pushed myself to finally do it. And I was struggling with a lot of things like why do you always like, you know, so it was, but then what I've learned about such moments in my life is there's always something. So just don't stress yourself like keep at it. Keep at it. Yeah. So I didn't go through but I was also very open minded. And it was it's anyway, I ended up in a group chat where there like a lot of actors or whatever. So it kept that interest alive. And then all of a sudden, an all the pointers of mine that I met through dance and hadn't seen for 10 years, met them at the master class. And then they were both surprised like, dancer. Yeah. What are you doing here? And then he was like, no, I'm into film and I work for a production company and I'm a writer and all that. And then sounds like, okay, cool. This seems interesting. I'm looking to like get into film. So if you have any projects, whatever, it doesn't even have to be acting like I can come and intern for you or whatever, that sort of thing. Just let me know. Putting myself out there. Remember, like I said, that that period of time, I was really intentionally trying to get out more. Yeah. Yeah. So like, I think maybe three, no, in fact, a year, a whole, almost a whole year past. And then he just called me up and he's like, hey, there's this audition. So you should go through that. And that's how I went through and got the parts. Interesting. And now I'm in a series, TV series. Wow. So you're you're you're practically doing something that is airing? Yes. Oh, interesting. Oh, so let me plug it here. Can I plug it? Okay. So the TV series is on Zambezi magic. Okay. It's called Chocolo. It's like a local production. Okay. And it airs like every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. That's huge. That's huge. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. First time on set. And you're on Zambezi magic. No, those are big moves. Those are big moves. And yeah, I can already see where this is going. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, kudos. So I do realize that, you know, having such a routine can be strenuous. It can be stressful. How do you keep yourself sane in such an environment and with everything that that you do? Hmm. It's true. It's true. It's really, let me not sit up here. I don't, you know, because that's actually one reason why I documented my dance journey a lot. And I started free styling because that was a whole like everything I do has a deeper story behind it. Yeah. You know, so when I started documenting and it's something I've also always had, I think, from childhood, I've always seen what I do as a message. Right. Even if I'm doing it for me, I know it's a message. I know it's hitting someone somewhere. So I always project this thing that I'm doing. What level of clarity do I have about how I'm going to explain it when I'm sitting before it just be when I'm sitting with Oprah doing my interview? Right. Right. Yeah. So when I made the decision to document it was like, okay, I don't want people, it will be hard for me to say, Oh, remember that time when I want to just reference, okay, this is what was going on. And then you can sort of see the, right, right. You can even see the progression. Yeah. Now remind me, there was a reason I went there. I go up a lot. It was how do you maintain the sanity? Yeah. Yeah. So it's really trial and error. And also everything I do is like so personal to me. There's always a story there. So even in the times where like now it's easy to say, Oh, I just did this and this, but no, it was just going with what's happening at the time and just trying to survive it. So now it's even hard for me to talk about like, let's say the struggles. I know like you even mentioned about like the struggles with family and whatever, it's a very real thing. It's a very real thing. And it's not easy by any means. And you have to make choices and sacrifices. Right. Right. So I made my sacrifices. You just have to be able to live with it. And that's why I go back to saying, when you know yourself, you know what you're able to deal with. Like other people can deal with at my age, not being married. Other people can deal with not having kids. Other people can deal with the pressure of their family saying, Yo, why aren't you married? Right. Right. You know, I want kids. I want to be married, I think. But yeah, those are sounds like the huge sacrifices in terms of what's conventional. But to me, because of what I'm getting out of it, it balances out. Not that it doesn't irk me or it doesn't frustrate me. No, but the other things that I get from doing things the way I've done that are fulfilling to me. So it balances out. And then I can say, I'm good. And it will happen when it will happen. If it's meant to happen. Okay. So we're just wrapping up our conversation now, Ghana. But I'd like to hear from you how what kind of advice you would give to somebody who wants to be liberated like you. Yeah, like, like this following a path and really much identifying that opportunities are there. Like what kind of mindset should they have? And what just kind of guidance would you give them? I think, first of all, I would say define for yourself what liberation is to you. Right. Because this kind of for me, it's for some people, what I'm doing is radical. Right. They don't get it. Yeah. You know, and they would definitely wouldn't dare do it. Yeah. Yeah. For some people, they see certain things and they think, oh, that's cool. And I want to do it too. Maybe they're very few though. You know, on the surface, I understand it can look a certain way, but you don't know the number of times that I've been like, I think I messed up. But this is just not for me. So know what liberation is for you. And it doesn't have to look like anybody else's. And sometimes even when it does, you still have to deal with you. So just be real with yourself and and strive to know yourself, like truly know yourself. And even I can't, I'm not sitting here claiming that I know myself. I'm just much more comfortable with where I am and who I am now. And I think that also comes with age, but also what you do with your age is important. So yeah, I think that's like know, know what you like, know who you are, and accept who you are for as long as it gives you peace. Because even when I say like, I want to say feels good, but feels good can often be miscontrude to only mean good feelings. No, I even know like okay, but when I'm when I'm being unreasonable, this is how I am. And also it's like a self-awareness that you know how other people receive you because you always have an explanation for but it's because you pissed me off. That's why. But you know, to someone else, it's a totally different thing. So yeah, it's just a process of knowing yourself and use your intuition. You are where you are. You feel what you feel. You think what you think you say, what you say, you do what you do for a reason. Right. And the more clear you are about that, I think the easiest to navigate life. That's deep. So what next, Fonguana? Have you set out a strategy for yourself? Yes, but I'm not about to tell you because we'll be here for another three hours. But yeah, like I mentioned, like I'm really like now we finished shooting for the season two of Chocolo. And now I really want to like develop as much skills as I can and sort of fast track my progression and my growth. Yeah, because even just being on set, like I learned so much and I'm still like eager to learn. Yeah. So I just want to do that now. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Fonguana, it's been deep.
