 If I'm going to make a painting, I want it to feel like a painting. What does painting do well that nothing else can do? And it would be, you know, cobbling together sloppy abstract shapes that if you took them apart, wouldn't make any sense. But you put them all together, you soften an edge here, you harden an edge here. You get the color harmonies just right. It all of a sudden pops into this representation of a memory. Hello, my name is Will Spencer and welcome to the Will Spencer podcast. This is a weekly show featuring in-depth conversations with authors, leaders and influencers who help us understand our changing world. New episodes release every Friday. My guest this week is Forrest Dickison, and he's a husband, father, fine artist and the author and illustrator of the new children's book, Crispin's Rain in the Sky. You may have seen it hanging around in the background of Doug Wilson's recent videos. Now, I haven't been blessed with kids just yet, so I don't read many children's books, but this has to be one of the finest I've come across, both in picture and in story. It tells the tale of a boy and his sister on the aforementioned rainy day, who then go on a swashbuckling adventure with pirate frogs, wherein the children's unique gifts shine. Now, I'm going to show you a little bit of the story behind the book. The book is the result of Forrest's life devoted to the visual arts, painting, drawing and more. It's the latest achievement of the book, which is a very unique story. Forrest says, I'm not going to spoil it, but this is a story that's not only a story that's very unique, but it's also a story that's very unique, and the children's unique gifts shine. Now, I don't want to spoil it, but the fact that there's even a spoilable plot point in a children's book says enough. It's the story of the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children, and it's the story of the children. Thanks for having me. I've got your, your book here, Christmas Rainy Day. I don't read a lot of kids' books, but I actually, I genuinely loved this one. This was heartwarming, it was exciting, it was beautifully drawn, and the messaging, and it was just, it was really, it was really touching. So I just wanted to congratulate you on this, not that I'm a condenctor of the, of the, of the art, but this was an excellent book. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. So I wanted to get started. to get started. I've also, as I mentioned to you, I'd also seen your paintings in the gallery in Moscow. So I've been looking forward to having this conversation because the visual arts are not one of my skill sets. I do enjoy travel photography, but painting and drawing and things like this are beyond me. So I've been looking forward to talking with you about your art and the process of getting to where you've been and also the books that you've created. Great. Let's do it. All right. So maybe we can just start at the beginning. When did you begin drawing, painting? What was the beginning of that? What did that look like for you? And I guess also, how was it nurtured to the point where you're like, hey, I can actually maybe do something with this? Yeah. So I don't remember a time when I wasn't drawing. I think every kid begins their life drawing. I was just one of those that didn't stop. So my friends, classmates, they kind of petered out in early grade school. And I was the kid that wanted to stay in from recess and draw skateboarders, snowboarders, monsters, anything that peaked my interest at the time. So I'd always been doing it. I loved Calvin and Hobbes, Tintin, Asterix. I loved old Disney animation, hand-drawn animation. My mom did a good job of hanging some nice prints on our walls growing up. So we had old masters, John Singer, Sargent, Soroya, Winslow Homer. We had some pretty good prints on the walls. So she had great taste. So I was always surrounded by stories and pictures. And then later in high school was when I realized that I was probably not going to be able to do anything else with my life. Praise God. I love it. So there was only one option. Nothing else really interested me. I thought maybe a marine biologist could be interesting, but I just thought manatees were cool. And that was a phase. I had a manatee phase. And they still have them. Maybe I'll do that someday. Yeah. So I graduated from Logos and then went to the University of Idaho, which is the local university here in Moscow, and jumped in at their fine art program. The program was kind of in between professors at the time. So they weren't dedicated drawing or painting professors there while I was attending. So I got a lot of instruction from the internet books and was given a lot of free time to just pursue it on my own. So and then, yeah, I think it was my junior year. I started working with Canon Press in college. Yes. I think the first project we did together was the Riot and the Dance Biology textbook that Dr. Gordon Wilson wrote. It has since ballooned into a whole Nature doc series that you can find on Canon Plus. Viddangel, I think, has it as well. But I'm not sure. So I started as a biology textbook. So I was illustrating Beatles things whose names I cannot remember. And then from there, I started working with Nate Wilson pretty early on as well. We started doing, I started helping him out with some pitch decks for some of his novels for film pitches. And then we started working on Hello, Ninja, the board book. And that was 2013, I think we started that came out in 2014. Yeah. And then that was that was kind of how my career started was biology textbooks, Hello, Ninja. And then Canon Press is they produce curriculum books, all kinds of different books, trade books, a few novels, things like that. So I was I was immediately stretched into all kinds of different artistic categories right off the bat, which I'm very grateful for. So, yeah, that's an introduction. I'm glad I'm glad you said that because, you know, I'm looking at the Crispin's Rainy Day art style. It's got a little bit of the, as at Howell's Moving Castle, Miyazaki kind of kind of feeling to it, at least in the eyes. But as I looked at this book, and looked at the looked at the drawings, looked at the art, and then I compared it with what I saw at the gallery. There was one particular painting of yours, it had sort of like a sort of had a magenta sky, you probably know the one that I'm thinking of looking out over an idyllic landscape and something about that sunset really caught me. But there's there couldn't be a bigger difference, at least to me, there couldn't be a bigger difference between the what you painted in that painting and the art style of this textbook. And I think it makes sense that you would have done so much different stuff. And that's how you would be able to cross the line so many different, so many different lines in visual arts to different styles. Yeah, that's interesting to hear you say that because I don't think about it too much. I just think in terms of genre, I'm trying to make a nice painting that will be, you know, it'll it's a composition that can stand on its own. There's no characters in it. So it's just a landscape painting. But I'm using a lot of the same muscles to illustrate a page of a picture book. There's so and that started out as a curiosity for any any kind of image making I was interested in. So whether it was cartoons, like I said, animation, printmaking, board game art, video game art, biology textbooks, I just anything that was interesting to me, I chased it, which has been really helpful. And one one reason I did that, because I just needed money. So anything anybody was willing to pay, I said, Yeah, let's do it. Sure. But what that gave me was kind of an ability to jump between mediums or genres without too much trouble. So yeah. So when you when you started out as a kid, I guess you were probably drawing in like school notebooks with a pen or a pencil or something like that, or did you just jump right into watercolors or acrylics? Like how did how did that take shape? And also as I look at Crispin's rainy day, what was this done in? Was this was this digital? Was this illustrator or was it hand drawn? So combination? It was a combination. All the colors or colors are digital. But I made an effort to make them look as traditional as possible. The line work is all traditional. So it's it's dip pen and dip pen and ink on Bristol board. So I penciled and inked traditionally and then colored it digitally. I was going to color it traditionally, but we were running out of time and I had to get it done. So and then what was the other part of that question? So was there was there a medium that was interesting to you off the bat? Or was it just, you know, right into whatever you could get into your hand? Yeah, no, right off the bat. There was no medium that caught my interest. It was just drawing. So it was pencil and paper. And then color just was a way to enhance what I was already drawing. So colored pencils when I was younger. And then Logos School does a great job of giving art instruction to its students that I found out is rare and not something that's done in most schools across the country. So when I have friends, I told them I spent my I had instructors during elementary school that taught me, you know, they would draw a sunflower and then I would have to copy the sunflower. All my art friends were blown away because they never had any kind of instruction like that from their public schools. So I'm grateful to Logos for giving me art lessons that I definitely did not appreciate at the time. I thought they were boring, but it was a good foundation for what I would eventually do. So it was all just pencil, pen and ink. And then I loved animation, but that was hand drawn animation was an art form that was kind of on the way out when I was just getting old enough to enter the workforce. So I had kind of set that aside and went and pursued oil painting. That was what I chased in college. It was a good way to combine my interests, my interest for being outside, taking hikes, going on trips with image making. So I was able to go outside and paint and respond to the landscape and the light directly, which was something that I found compelling. So it was pencil, paper and then oil paint. And those have been my two go to mediums for a while now. So again, I'm not a visual artist. I like landscape photography and travel photography. Can you talk a little bit about the process of painting a landscape in the landscape? This is one of like, maybe at some point in my life, I will pursue that. Maybe I will chase that because that's something that I think speaks to me. So maybe you could talk a little bit about how you got into that, what the process has been like learning that, what your process is for doing a painting like that as well. That would bless me quite a bit. Yeah, it's thrilling. I remember the first time I went out, I had bought these water soluble oil paints, which you think about it, makes no sense at all because water and oil don't mix. But somehow they were able to take these paints, introduce a molecule or remove a molecule that ruined it and became water soluble. And I went out with some friends. It was freezing cold. I grabbed water from a creek to mix my paints. And I made a atrocious little painting of some birch trees. But it was thrilling because it felt like hunting. I was out there in the wild, ready to kill something. It felt primal. It was challenging. You have 360 degrees of view around your easel. You have temperature, you have sound, you have wind, all these different factors that are bombarding your senses. And you have to pick one little thing out of that cacophony of sensation and scrape it onto a little canvas with some colored dirt and then make it convincing so that you can take that experience that you had in the wild, put it onto a little piece of vegetable guts, stretched over some canvas, and then give it to somebody else. And if it's done well, they can experience what you did almost as effectively, which I think is fascinating. So I enjoy the process of hunting. It's challenging. It's clear whether you succeed or fail. There's not a lot of wishy-washy gray area. You either make a nice painting or you don't. And then I enjoy being able to kind of bottle that sensation or experience and frame it nicely, give it to somebody else, so that they can then enjoy it as well. When you take the canvas out there into the wild, do you finish it all at once? Is that the goal? I've got X amount of time to finish it before the sun sets or a storm rolls in, or can you actually bring it back and try again or add to it? Yeah, both. It's nice to finish on the spotter, as they're called, but that rarely happens. Usually, you only have an hour or two before the light changes. Your subject matters completely different. So you have to be quick. And then once you've got that impression down, you can take it back to the studio. And I'll generally just, most of my plein air, this is what it's called when you paint plein air. It's the open air. When you're painting plein air, I generally just make studies and then bring it back to the studio for larger pieces or I'll fix it up in the studio. It's challenging to get something finished out there in the field. Okay, that makes sense, because I was imagining, well, you only have X amount of time, just with the light being the way it is and the care and the thought and the attention, the detail that goes into a beautiful piece. Maybe it'll come together in the course of a couple hours, but it didn't seem likely to me that lightning would strike that often. Yeah, no, it doesn't. And there's something charming about a sketch. So I do like an unfinished sketch. There's a lot of energy. If it's done well, if it's not entirely finished, then there's more for the viewer's imagination to do when it's looking at that particular painting. So they can finish it on their end, and then it becomes a little more sticky in their own mind, I think. So there's a charm to an unfinished sketch, but generally, it's a good idea to finish things. Oh, okay. So you mean, so you will do like a pencil sketch of the landscape, and then someone could look at that and their mind could fill in the details, the colors, versus a finished painting, which leaves less room for the imagination. Yes, a pencil sketch or a color sketch. So I really can a quick little color scribble either way. A color scribble. Well, so okay, I'm glad we're talking about this because I'm thinking about the art exhibit that was in Moscow during Grace Agenda. And one of the things I noticed, again, this is coming from someone who doesn't have a fine arts background. I don't have enough language. I know what I see. I know what I like, and I can look critically at things as opposed to like, that's cool and just walk away. So I noticed that there was a difference between some of the paintings you had done, which I guess I would call them more impressionistic, and some of the more hyper realistic, hyper detailed kind of approaches, which had a different kind of appeal. I wonder if you can talk through the differences between those. Because I imagine it's like a six of one half dozen, another of the other an artist's approach, someone's personal taste. But maybe you can talk about like the selection of styles in that regard. Yes. So yeah, personal taste has a lot to do with it. But I've and I've been through a lot of different styles on my fine art journey. So and but I've recently landed in, I guess what you call more of an impressionistic camp. Because when I'm painting, what interests me is the soul of a place or the overall impression of a landscape. It's I want my goals to frame a window that is sort of a well, an entrance into another world. So I'm not looking, I'm not that interested in detail. I'm not interested in subject matter as much as the light. So the subject matter obviously matters. But I'm looking for that broad impression, color harmony, something that feels more like the place than looks just like a representational photograph of the place. The strength of an impressionist painting, if it's done well, is what we talked about earlier, where you have something that is not entirely finished. And so when somebody looks at it, and it's, you know, there's a brushstroke every other inch or something, but then you step back, and it all kind of coheres into this unified piece of art. That is the viewer's mind finishing the painting, kind of with the artist. And so instead of me just giving the viewer everything, you know, here's everything down to the little hairs, that doesn't, it's not as much of a poetic take on the landscape. It's more just a one-to-one representation, which can be impressive, but it doesn't scratch the itch that I'm trying to scratch, which is a broad impression of a place that is delivered straight to your soul, you know. I'm trying to bypass all the information, tree, grass, clouds, and just give you the impression of what it felt like to be there, which is, I think that style, simpler design, broader brushstrokes, color harmonies that are not exactly the same as what you'd see in nature. It actually does a better job of feeling like a place than a photograph would. Yeah, so I'm trying to get the most out of painting when I do it. And that impressionistic style, I think, is it lends itself well to that more poetic take on the landscape. When you say you're trying to get the most out of it, what exactly do you mean by that? Like the most evocative feeling, the viewer feels the most engrossed in it, or you have effectively communicated what it felt like to be there, maybe all of the above? Yes, but making the most of the medium. So if I'm going to make a painting, I want it to feel like a painting. What does painting do well that nothing else can do? And it would be, you know, cobbling together sloppy abstract shapes that if you took them apart, wouldn't make any sense. But you put them all together, you soften an edge here, you harden an edge here, you get the color harmonies just right. It all of a sudden pops into this representation of a memory. So that's what painting does that nothing else really can do. So if with Crispin's rainy day, I needed something a little more specific, something that lended itself to gesture and expression and characterization. So that's, I'm going to grab the pen so that I could get really detailed expressions out of the characters. I couldn't get, I mean, you could, I could have painted the whole thing, but it would have taken forever. And the expressions wouldn't be as iconic. So by making them, by turning these characters into lines, you're sort of boiling them down to their simplest form so that it can be delivered quickly and effectively, almost like, I don't know, emojis. That's, yeah. So when I'm painting, I don't want to be making comics. I don't want to be making a photograph. I want to be making a painting feel as much like a painting as possible so that it can be just what it is. So as you say that, I've got the book, I've got Crispin's rainy day here. I want to hold something up to the camera for those who are watching. So I guess, I guess you use the word iconic. And so this is the, I don't know, spoiler I guess, but where he finds the lightning sword, I guess, I've never, this language is great because it's helping me interpret linguistically things I've only seen visually. So when you say iconic, obviously, like this image of Crispin with a sword, I look at this and I immediately know what's happening. There's not really a whole lot of room for ambiguity. It's there, it's clear, the lines are sharp, the action is communicated versus if you were to try and do this in a painting, there would be a lot more interpretive work on the viewers and like, what am I actually looking at? What is the meaning of being Crispin? It moves less, I suppose. Right. And it depends if I had painted it photo realistically or if I had painted it with a high degree of detail, it could have done something similar. But the goal here in that image and every image in this book is the goal is to deliver the story effectively. And so tying it all down by means of black and white line work is what I thought was an effective way to do that. So maybe we can talk a little bit about how that came together. This, I think, this makes a little bit more sense how something like this would happen, maybe beginning with a story outline, maybe in the form of text and then breaking it into a storyboard kind of form and settling on that. But maybe you can walk people through like, what does it take to produce a children's book? Because I can look at this and I can say, this is deceptively simple. It's a five, 10, 15 minute experience. You're meant to be read probably multiple times. Do it again, Daddy, like that. But it's not going to take three hours to go through the book. And that's only possible because of probably many hours on the front end to make that reading process so simple. Yeah, I wanted to make the highest quality peanut butter and jelly sandwich that I could. I know it's going to take seconds to consume or minutes. But I know from personal experience, the books that I loved growing up, those little, those few minutes where your parents are reading to you or you're reading by yourself can have outsized impact down impacts down the line. So yeah, with this book in particular, I started with an image of a boy jumping through a puddle. That was what I wanted. I didn't have any idea what was in the puddle. I didn't, there wasn't Rose, the sibling, the little sister was not around at that point. I just liked the idea of a backyard adventure. A puddle is something that everybody can relate to. We've all seen one. We've probably all jumped in one. There it is. So I thought that's a great little entrance to a world that anyone can access in their backyard. So I started there. And then also, and then the next thing that came was the color palette. I had this very specific idea in mind for this pop of yellow, the yellow rain jacket against grays and greens and blues of a kind of a rainy day. So I had the color palette. I had the boy jumping through a puddle. And then from there, it was, I was bouncing between images and text. So I would sketch some ideas and then write some words that would maybe that would could go with those images. And it was really just a lot of trial and error. I would take one direction until I was bored or confused. And then I would back up to where I was still interested and then take that and run with it. And that was kind of the process. Anytime I got bored, I scrapped it, went back to where I still liked it and then kept running from there. So the story really took shape once. I think once I decided that he was going to jump through the puddle and fall into an ocean and meet up with a crew of his own, you know, his own crew of pirate frogs, that made me happy. So I ran the fact. Yeah, it was, there's nothing wrong with that. So yeah, I remember the feeling very vividly of him, the wish fulfillment for a kid of having your own crew of pirate frogs just waiting to do your bidding seemed like it was a worthwhile endeavor. And then because there needed to be a story and not just a boy and his pirate frogs doing whatever they wanted, I introduced the Rose, his sister. And so then the story became more about it became about their relationship. How does a brother, how do a brother and a sister work together in this world that's fantastical and a whole lot of fun and very rainy? So the story was your original creation? Yes. That's beautiful. That I didn't expect. I read through this and I thought it was so moving because how do you, in our modern context, how do you portray a woman's participation or little girl's participation in a hero story in a way that doesn't make her into the Ray Skywalker boss babe, but that also doesn't relegate her to a second class character? And you struck that balance beautifully, I thought. Thank you. Yeah, I'm glad to hear that you are picking up on that because that was what I set out to do. Once the sister came along, it was when I got really excited because I knew that it could be done, it's been done before. How do you have a female character who's strong in a uniquely feminine way? How do you have a boy character who's strong in a uniquely masculine way such that they do work together and it elevates both of them in their particular station? It's too easy to take them out. Mostly what happens is you have a girl character that's turned into a second-rate boy character just because, and it's then it's miniature Wonder Woman, or like you said, Ray Skywalker, whatever, or you just have to make the girl character actually heroic but then put down the boys that he's a loser and guilty for existing. And I wanted to figure out a way to have both of those things in harmony in one story. Well, again, I don't want to spoil it for the listeners because I want everyone to go and buy this book for their kids, but what was the, and maybe even for themselves or for, I mean, Christmas is coming up so you can buy it for family members with young children too. What is it? This book is for like five to 10-year-olds. That's what the rough age range. Yeah, I wrote it for my girls and they're ages six to two. I have a six-year-old, a four-year-old, a two-year-old, and a two-year-old. But yeah, this is probably bad to admit, but age never factored into what I was thinking along the way. I just was six-year-old in general. That's something that the parents parents needed to like it as well because they're the ones reading it to the kids. So as you were writing the story, what resources did you turn to to try and find how to strike that balance between the siblings where the little girl could have a very valuable role in the story without stepping on the boy's role in the story and vice versa? Let's see. Well, honestly, it was a lot of Miyazaki. He's one of the few creators that really gets feminine strength, I think. It was important that Rose in this story not have a character arc. So all the angst and frustration is on Crispin's side. He's the one that is desperate to find this lightning blade and loses it at his little sister because he's frustrated. Rose, on the other hand, she says what she wants on the first page and by the end of the book, she gets exactly what she wants. She never loses her cool. She never gets in the way of the mission. In fact, she's vital to the mission. So Miyazaki does that in most of his stories. His female characters are great. There's a few that are not so great, but in general, that was the flavor that I wanted to highlight in this story. Thank you for pointing that out because there was something about the two characters that I couldn't put my finger on, but you nailed it. Yes, Crispin has the angst, he has the arc, he has the journey in his particular way. Then you have Rose and she's a consistent force throughout. I guess I picked up on that, but I couldn't quite... There was a relief in encountering her character, not just in the completion of the story, but also the role that she plays. There's a lot going on in this story. Yeah, there's a lot. Rose, part of the critiques I got early on when I was showing drafts of this around was that she was not interesting as a character because she had no character arc. But that only just told me that I was on the right track because not every character needs to have an arc to be compelling. Rose is somebody who knows who she is, she knows what she wants, and because she's unflustered by the chaos around her, everything conforms to her vision. She compels this rowdy crew of pirate frogs by not reacting to them. I think that's something that is incredibly important for especially younger girls to learn is reacting is never helpful. By reacting, you're just putting that other person in charge. If you stay calm, keep your emotions in check, you can control any situation that you've been given. That's wonderful. That I did pick up on in a couple of the scenes that she was very non-reactive in environments where I think the opposite is portrayed in culture, where girls are encouraged to be reactive. There's one particular scene I'm thinking of, you probably know, the one where she's confronted with a big challenge very suddenly, didn't go the way that she wanted to. Her response is like, oh, here we go again. You know what I mean? In a very grounded way. I was like, as a reader, of course, I'm invested in Crispin's story, but as a reader, as a man who's sensitive to some of these themes in culture today regarding feminism and the male versus female roles and women being second rate versions of men and all that, to have a little girl character who is authentically a little girl and isn't trying to be a bad version of little boy was incredibly refreshing. Good. Glad to hear you say that. I thought so too. I think the other thing that was really nice about it was you didn't shy away from, and I think this is probably okay to say because it's in the first part of the book, of the little girl having a more domestic role, explicitly domestic role, but that didn't feel demeaning. That's the part as I was working the way through the story. How is it going to balance this without it seeming demeaning? I know that's of course what everyone in Moscow gets accused of being, not what they actually are. I think Pastor Doug just did the Theobros essay a couple days ago, and he was sort of talking about that. You managed to strike that balance very well of her being in a, I guess we call it the domestic role, but it not, but it being an enhancement of her character in the story in general. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's just a big, dumb, boring lie that the domestic role is uninteresting and unfulfilling. I think it's, yeah, one of feminism's biggest crimes is that it produces incredibly boring characters, boring people. I hate it. It's just so uncompelling. So I made sure, yeah, I wanted Rose to offend all the wrong people. So she's, you know, at what point the pirates yell at the dragon to give us back our maid. So it's, I just leaned into the stereotypes as much as I could because in this day and age, well, in any day and age, the stereotypes, you know, they ring true for a reason. Yeah, and also I have three little girls. So I've noticed that they tend to be, well, feminine. You know, they're not, they're not out there playing with trucks and making up, turning everything into a gun. They, everything they touch turns into a nest or a baby or some kind of cooking utensil. And nobody taught them that. That's just who they are. And it's glorious. Why would I want to make that? Why would I want to turn them into something that they're not? So yeah, I wanted Rose to be strong, compelling, and maintain, while maintaining her femininity. And Crispin got to be a little, he's very obviously a little boy. You know, it's he's not a, he's not a man doing little boy things. He's a little boy with little boy emotions on this big quest. And I got the balance of the characters. And that's the, that's the, the only two characters of the book really are Crispin and Rose. And you, you balanced it. And that, that was the thing that I think really struck me. Again, this is like a little kid's book, which is, you know, that way, that there's so much to unpack in a little kid's book feels completely appropriate at the same time. But you, you managed to also, I mean, Crispin feels authentically like a little boy. He's a little boy on an adventure with little boy emotions. And, and he brings his sister along the most reluctantly, but she plays a role in the story. It's just a, there's something, I don't know, I don't feel ashamed to say that it's just a very powerful story that you crafted and along with the visuals as well. Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate it. So, so maybe we can talk also about Hello Ninja. So I had a copy of the first Hello Ninja book, which I won in an NSA raffle. So that, but I can't find it. I moved recently. So maybe it's in a box or maybe I donated it and I have a lot of little kids running around. So I'm not, what am I going to read this to? So maybe you could talk a little bit about that project as well. Yeah. So that was, that was the first thing that Nate and I worked on together. That was, I think I was still a senior in college when I jumped onto that. And he, he was just curious about the board book market. He wanted to try something. So he wrote, I think he wrote three actually, one, one was Hello Ninja, one was blah, blah, black sheep. And then maybe the third one never got written, but there was another third one with zebras, I believe. But yeah, so my goal with Ninja was just, I wanted to make a board book that didn't look like a lot of the board books that I had seen. I wanted something that was colorful, had depth, was fully painted. It was all digitally done. So it wasn't traditional paint, but I was a art student at the time. So I was just trying to paint things that I was basically practicing what I had been seeing. So I wanted different lighting situations, different color palettes. And that was kind of, that was it. That was as far as I was thinking with that book. And then it went out there, it made its way into the Starbucks pick of the week, which was one of Nate's other books. A sample of it was going to be out there. Somehow that failed through. So we just slotted in Ninja instead. That went well. So from there, it made its way into Target. It sold well at Target. And at that point, I think Nate and I were both thinking this is, it couldn't go any further than this. We had moved on creatively. At least I had. But then Nate's agent in LA picked it up and decided to run with it. And she shopped it around to a bunch of different studios. And it ended up at Netflix against all odds. And I think 2018 was when we started working on the show with a studio up in Vancouver called Atomic Cartoons. So, and Nate was a producer and a writer. I was a design consultant and a designer as well. So we both had some creative control throughout the whole process. What was that process like watching that just kind of experiment, reach the heights of culture in some way? It was fantastic. I learned a lot along the way. And well, probably more looking back is where all the lessons came from. But very grateful for it. I assumed that anything I touched from that point on would just be swept up into the machine and make millions of dollars and be a huge hit. Oh, obviously. Obviously. That's what I assumed. It hasn't worked out exactly like that. What? I know. So, but lots of lessons were learned. It was a great process. Working with Netflix was actually pretty great. Working with Atomic Cartoons was fantastic. They were all talented and very professional people. So overall, it was a really fun experience. Yes, has yet to be replicated, but we're working on it. So what is the Hello Ninja series about? What's the overall vision? What were you guys trying to achieve with it originally? And then how did that take shape as it blew up? Yeah, Nate could probably tell you more about the original vision. I just know it was the original vision for me was make it as fun as possible. He just handed me the manuscript and I just thought, how can I squeeze as many fun things to paint as possible into this little short boardbook? So that was my goal. Make it fun. Make it full of light. Make it a good time. And that vision, make it fun, was maintained throughout the whole process. But once it was turned into a show, we were very consciously trying to make a show that was genuinely healthy for kids' imagination. So the goal was not to just provide a little escape from reality. We wanted something that would encourage kids on their own journeys to become better characters themselves. So we wanted to enforce play patterns, behavior, imaginative adventuring that would be imitated by the viewers in a way that was constructive, healthy, normal. Because we knew all the competition was doing the same, but pointing kids in the wrong direction for the most part. So it just became one of Netflix's most expensive snacks that they ever made for kids, at least. That was expensive. Go ahead. They, you know, it was a year of production. Lots of money and time and manpower was made, was put into this show that, you know, it's four seasons, each episode is maybe 10 minutes long. So we wanted to just leave the audience better than we found them. So there were a few battles we had about, you know, when there were some feminist tendencies that we're trying to creep in or this or that, the other thing, you know. But overall, it was in a whole lot that we had to fight about. So, yeah, I'm proud of it. I'm happy to have got to be a part of it. And I think it's a good, a good solid show. Yeah, that was going to be my next question. Like, as you bring this healthy, wholesome kid story into Netflix, which, you know, for me, I imagine that it's somewhat of a meat grinder to take a good idea and twist it around into some, you know, woke zombie version of what it once was. You know, to hear that it came out true to the original vision is, that's actually pretty encouraging to me. Yeah, God was very kind. And I think we just, we were teamed up with the right people. And Netflix, this was before, you know, this was before 2020. This was before things that Netflix went extremely woke. They already were, but there's no way that two white guys like myself and Nate could go make a show about a little Japanese boy today with Netflix, at least. And maybe it'll swing back, who knows. But we, I think we snuck in right at the tail end of when that would be acceptable and workable. So, yeah, I don't know. The biggest lesson was, all I can do is the best that I can do at the time. And if God chooses to bless it, then no one's going to stop him. So, that was it. Maybe you could say more about that, because I imagine that there are probably some parents listening and listening and probably some, some creatives as well, you know, who, of course, I've had my own creative processes that I've been involved in. Again, like photography was a big one for me. But maybe you can speak more about that, about, you know, trust, like doing the best you can and trusting God with the results. Yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. It's, you want to do the best you can, so that if God does bless it, you're not embarrassed once it's out there and fakes. But also so that, you know, if you make something to a certain, if you make something excellent, it will get out there. I think cream rises. But the, the rising, that's all God. So, as an artist, all you can really focus on, focus on is making great cream. Like, do what you can to make your craft as excellent as possible. Position yourself, if you can, with the right people to make it go. But, you know, we plant water, but it's God who brings the increase. So, everything I've worked on since Ninja is, you know, has not gone as nearly as explosive. But I'm, it doesn't really bother me because I'm still just, I know I'm doing the same thing that I was doing then, for whatever reason, nothing has worked out quite the same way. But God, God is the one that's going to bless it or not when he feels like it. So, I think there's real wisdom of that. I've had some tweets go mega viral around the world. And if I keep trying to achieve that same thing again, you know, not even like, maybe I, maybe I'll get there, but I'll drive myself crazy trying to do it. When ultimately, when something like that is happening, it's like, well, this is clearly a God thing. And, you know, praise him for making this possible. But I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna be able to make lightning strike twice. Like I just have to do the best job that I can with everything that I put my hand to. And God will take care of the rest. You said something really interesting too. You said, put your all into it so that you're not embarrassed. Because I guess it is kind of possible that something could do really well. And it's like, oh, there's a typo there, or there's a mistake there. Like God can do that as well, which I, I tend to forget that. Right. And Ninja was actually interesting because the first version of the book that you apparently have somewhere in a box. Yes. You know, I was a student when I made it. So Oh, yeah. It was a little bit, you know, I look at it now and I think, oh, wow, that's, you know, I could do so much better. But God didn't care. I did what I could. And he took it and ran with it. And then we ended up selling the book rights to Harper Collins. And they went, they went and made four, four new Ninja books. So we remade the first book. We made another one. And then we made two kind of spin off. I can read Ninja books. And so I was actually able to go back and just recreate the first book with, you know, four years of artistic expertise under my belt, which I was grateful for. So I could kind of tinker with it once it was already out there, which is not an opportunity that is often given to artists. Yes, I can, I can relate to that where I go back and listen to something, maybe an interview that I did or something like that. And I look at that and it's like, oh, I would do that so much better. Right. That's just part of it. So, so maybe you can talk a little bit about thinking back on your experience as an artist, especially for the parents who are listening, you know, what can, what can they do? What helped you cultivate your gifts and abilities that was unique to your upbringing? Like maybe some, some teachers that made a difference, maybe some things that your parents did that really gave you an added push in your gifts. Because I imagine there's probably more than a few parents listening that have spotted what they think or what might even really be genuine artistic talent and interest in their children. And that they don't know how to cultivate that because they don't have it themselves. So you can share a little bit about that, maybe some of the individuals or some of the decisions that were made, you know, for you to help to help, you know, shepherd you in a particular direction. Yeah. So I think there's two, two answers to that question. The first is that my parents were never concerned, really, about my desire to become an artist. They were only ever encouraging, which I was very grateful for because instead of making me complacent and lazy in my pursuit of artistic excellence, I only ever wanted to, you know, please them. So it was, it was encouraging that they were only ever encouraging, obviously. They weren't trying to hold me back or they weren't asking me questions like, how are you going to make money? Maybe they ought to have been. They never worried about it. They only ever encouraged me, bought me art supplies, gave me art lessons. And that just made me want to work hard to not let them down, I guess. And then my high school basketball coach, I credit him the most with the work ethic. So talent only gets you so far. Even interest only gets you so far. You know, you can love something, you can be good at it. But unless you're, unless you have the skill set, the muscle memory that it takes to show up and actually put the work in, all that interest and intent is not going to go anywhere. So I learned my work ethic, what little work ethic I have comes from high school basketball. So high school basketball was where I learned to just keep pushing even when I wanted to lie down and give up and be done. So athletics combined with nothing but encouragement from my parents, I think enabled me to actually make it as a professional artist. And then I'll say one more thing. We weren't very good. Our high school basketball team was not very good. So we lost a lot. And at the end of the game, the score was always objective and it did not care about how you felt. Artists can tend to be coddled. Their emotions can be coddled by their parents, by their peers, because the artistic temperament is given a free pass, because that's just the way that artists are. And let's not, you know, we'll just leave them there. They're weird. They are weird, but they need, artists need to be in absolute control of their emotions so that when you put something out into the world and it doesn't go well, it's, you're not affected by it. So it's losing it basketball all the time, knowing that there's objective standards for excellence, objective standards for beauty, truth, goodness, that all apply to what you're making is you have to get there emotionally, intellectually, so that you don't get out into the world and just think that, you know, likes on Instagram translates to success as a human being, you know. So develop a thick skin, get used to losing, but don't ever settle with losing. Just keep grinding, keep pushing, always be chasing that excellence. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Because it seems like that ties into some of what we said about non-reactivity. It ties into discipline, and it ties in also to the only way that we really achieve excellence is through failure, right? And so I think that there's a tendency that we have in culture today, and I think it shows up across culture, to not tell somebody when they've failed at something, which does them a great disservice. You know, you have to, like, like you said, like a basketball score is objective. It doesn't matter how you feel about it, but because we think of art as subjective and to some extent it is, but I think we all know when we listen to a song that we like, or a good song, whether or not we like it, or look at a beautiful painting or whatever it is, we know when something lands. But if we're afraid to tell somebody when it doesn't, how will they know what it takes to produce something that does? And I think a lot of the hesitation that people have is like, well, I don't want to hurt their feelings. Like, well, maybe they kind of need their feelings to be hurt. They don't intentionally hurt their feelings, right? Like, I'm going to get them, but you have to, maybe you can talk to them because you had to work through that. Like every professional artist that I've ever met has had to work through countless failures emotionally, right? The thing that they really liked, like, you know, they put that out there and it's like, no, it doesn't work. What? This is amazing, right? So maybe you can talk some, because that's the professional side of being an artist. Yeah, it's just, I mean, it's cliche. It's not how many times you get hit, but how many times you get back up. It's just, can you do it over and over again? And yeah, being an artist, you're putting your whole soul into something. When you're creating it, it's like, you are, you are God. This is amazing. It's the inspiration is flowing. And then you put it out there. Nobody cares. It gets 10 likes on social media, which is, or, or, you know, you put it out there, you can't see your mom and they just go, that's nice. Slap it on the fridge and it's in the, in the trash the next day. Yeah, it's funny. This is so my girls won't stop drawing, which is good. They're, they're good at it and they love it. They're making books constantly. But this is something that we're dealing with, you know, there's six and four, but when I throw away their drawings all the time, because at first I was trying to keep everything, you know, because I didn't want to hurt their feelings. And I wanted to, I wanted to have this record of this pure artistic expression. But I realized quickly that that was not actually helping them grow. Like, no, you, yeah, you made a nice drawing. We'll put it on the fridge for a day, maybe. And then it's in the trash because it's onto the next one. Like, you know, if it's really excellent, I'll stick it in a frame, put it on the wall. But, and once, yeah, now they're, they're totally comfortable with their drawings being trashed all the time, not by me, right, but, you know, thrown into the trash. And that's, I think it's a, that's the mindset that I think every artist needs to cultivate is that the work is just work. It's not who you are. It's, it's, it's something that you're producing in order to bless other people. If they are not blessed by it, you can't get offended at that. So if you put it out there and nobody likes it, all that tells me is that you put it out there as because you wanted praise, you wanted your own ego to be scratched and you wanted your friends to say, wow, I could never do that, you know. But the whole point is that you're making food for somebody else's soul. You want them to be uplifted, encouraged, inspired. So then if you frame it that way, you put something, you put a painting up on the wall, and nobody is uplifted or encouraged, that wouldn't make any sense to throw a fit about that. You're saying, oh, I'll just have to make it better. And then hopefully it will achieve its goal. Can you talk about, if you'd be willing to, one of your experiences where there was something that you were particularly attached to, and you put it out there and it maybe went over like a lead balloon and you had to work through that? Maybe there have been too many to count, but I can't remember. I don't know. I think my ditch might be on the other side where I preemptively despise my own work just so that when somebody else doesn't like it, I can, well, I beat you to it. I also think it's not any good. So whatever. You can't hurt me. You can't fire me. I quit. So there's that other, that's, I think, that's my ditch, is to be a little more, to cut the cord a little too readily, maybe, or to be, to just throw it out there and move on. Yeah, so I can't, sorry, I can't recall a time when I was devastated that somebody didn't like what I did. I'm sure it happened. I know it happened, but I just don't know. I don't remember. No, I mean, what I'm getting at, I think, and that makes a lot of sense, that you would preemptively dismiss your own work for fear of being hurt, and you're right, that is definitely a ditch. So because I'm interested in, for the parents listening and for the creative people listening, who are, who struggle with these issues either in themselves or their kids, because I think that there are so many gifted and talented children and adults for that matter, who have learned to dismiss their own work, or have learned to overvalue their own work and finding that way through that path, the navigating that, but then also how we can learn to cultivate our own creative process, whether or not we want to go pro with it, because I think everyone has a, has a different, we'll call it a creative gift and a different feel, whether it be music or the visual arts or writing, but the process of, of birthing it, of shipping it, as they say in the tech world, that's the terrifying thing. It's easier to leave something unfinished or keep it private, than to actually subject it to someone looking at it. And so I think that's really important for people to learn how to do for their own well-being, for their own creativity, for glorifying God, and also especially for parents who are watching their children grow and are trying to express gifts and want to know how to cultivate them, but also knowing that it's a hard world, right? And just because you think something is amazing doesn't mean anyone else will, but you also have to think it's amazing too. Maybe I'm, I don't know, I'm putting my thoughts together the right way. Oh yeah. That's all, it all makes sense. I think, yeah, well going back to the other ditch where if you're out there, trashing your own work before anyone else can, that's just as selfish as looking for the ego trip, where you're just looking for praise. So either you're just looking for praise or you throw it out there and then you just say, oh, it's so bad. I'm no good. I'm no good. That's just as selfish and just as gross. You should stop it. It's, and it's also a disservice to the to your audience. So if you throw something out there and it does connect, it does bless them, they do like it. And then, you know, you're out there saying, it's no good. You're just telling those people that their taste is bad and that this thing that they genuinely had affection for is dumb, you know, from maybe one of their heroes, you know, it's so trashing your own work is selfish. Looking for praise is selfish. So the whole point is, like I said, to bless somebody else. So if it's about you, it's going to end in tears. It is challenging because at the end of the day, you're the one that has to make it. It's your tastes, your skill level, your time, blood, sweat, and tears that is going into this project. So you do have to like it. And you do have to know it intimately inside and out just to make it, you know, before you can ship it. But at the end of the day, you're just cooking a meal, you're making something to feed somebody else. And when you look at it that way, you don't want to be the chef that puts something on the table and just say, yes, you know, I could have done better. Or there wasn't as much salt. And everyone's just enjoying the meal. And you're over here saying, yeah, it wasn't salty enough. Sorry, apologizing for it and ruining everybody's experience. Just put it out there and just make a, you know, flag a note. Okay, needs more salt. So next time, the meal will be a little bit better. Next time, it'll be a little bit better. And just don't make it about yourself once you start, once it's out there. Can you think, okay, so addressing the other ditch then, can you think of when you had to learn how to accept praise? Because that is definitely a thing where people don't know how to graciously, someone says, that's amazing. And if the tendency is to say, oh, no, no, it's terrible, like, no, you want to honor them in their experience, maybe you can talk about that. Yeah, this is going back to basketball, one of my friends, one of my teammates, his dad just told him, look, at the end of the game, if somebody says good game, doesn't matter if you won or lost, all you have to say back is good game. Great job. You know, you don't, you don't need to say, ah, I shot so poorly or, yeah, you know, and then or flatter them. And, you know, you did really great too. You know, all you need to say is thank you. And then, you know, if somebody, yeah, the more I make things, the more I realize that it's not, it's, I'm just sort of showing up and putting stuff together. But the idea and the art sort of comes from somewhere else. I'm sort of just an archaeologist discovering something. That's what it feels like. So when somebody else comes and says, I loved this, you know, I'm, I'm just free to say, oh, thank you. I also thought that was great. Wasn't it awesome? And it's this, it's something that's just totally divorced from my own ego, my own pride. And we're free to enjoy it together because now it's out there. It doesn't really belong to me anymore. It's just this artifact floating in the wild. So, yeah, if somebody praises you, just say thank you. That's it. And it's, yeah, then you bite your tongue. You don't say I'll do better next time. I still feel that. Don't say I'll do better next time or don't trash your work. But definitely, definitely don't rely on praise as a fuel to keep you going. It's, praise is nice. It's encouraging. But it's not, you're not really gonna, you never learn from it. You only really learn from critique, honest critique. So say, say more about that. I mean, if you throw something out in the world and, well, let's take social media for another example, you, you, you post a drawing and of course no one's gonna, I mean, maybe this happens, I guess, but people don't jump in the comments and just say, you stink, go home, quit drawing. Everyone just says, wow, amazing, amazing. You're the best. Oh, I wish I could draw like you, whatever it is. And then that becomes sort of your, the end goal of what it is you're doing. That praise is, it's just gonna stunt your growth because you're not actually gonna learn anything. So if you don't, if you throw something out there, no one's offering constructive criticism. They're just, they're just making your head a little bit bigger. And the worst thing you can do as a creative is learn to rely on that or to even worse, to love it, to love praise. You should, you should always feel a little bit uncomfortable when somebody says, great job, this is awesome. Yeah. So you don't, and praise is good because it means that somebody else was blessed. That's kind of, that's all it tells you. But if you throw something out there and you get a criticism, that's really actually helpful data. Because now you can go back and say, okay, this didn't land either because the audience missed it or because I failed to deliver. And if I failed to deliver, then you can go say, how was it this story? Was it color drawing? And then you can dissect it. And maybe they, maybe the audience picked up on something that they think is the problem, but you have to be intelligent enough to identify the problem somewhere else. So you fix it over here and then that particular reaction goes away, if that makes any sense. So that when people don't like something, that's when I really pay attention. Because then I, then you have to ask, why didn't they like it? Is it their problem? Is it my problem? Is it the worst problem? And then once you identify a problem, then there's an opportunity for education and growth. And that's exciting. Growth is always fun. And that's why it's so important to subject yourself to valid criticism, even though it might hurt your feelings, even though you have an emotional attachment to something. I mean, the Royal U, of course, that's the way that you're going to grow is by finding out what works and what didn't from an objective observer, not just friends, not just family, right? Who they, of course, they're going to love what you do because they love you. But there is something about like, no, you put it up and you let the public look at it, and you let them tear it apart. Yeah, it's terrible, but you got to do it. Yeah, absolutely. So maybe you can share a little bit with maybe some of the projects that you have coming up for either Cannonball or Cannon Press or what you're working on, what you're working on yourself. Yeah, so right now I'm working full time with Cannon Press on some animation content that is, we're trying to get a, right now there's a show and a feature that we're building out sort of elaborate pitch decks for. So I'm doing some short sample animation for these projects that we will then go out and attempt to wrangle some funding for. So that's what I'm doing full time right now. I'm painting on the side. There's the gallery that you saw as a new addition to Moscow owned by or run by New St. Andrews College. So I'm supplying some paintings there. And then I'm working on a graphic novel on the other side as well. Those are the main projects that I've got going at the moment. So you're, so how do you, I mean, I guess you're all, it sounds like you're always creating something whether you're at work or whether you're working in the graphic novel or you're painting. Like, is this just a constant state of, I guess, a state of mind that you're in? Yes. It's all, yeah. The short answer is yes. I mean, I will say that Sundays are extremely important. And you start to understand the way that, why God did it the way that he did, because I can, I know that I can just, you know, all six cylinders for six weeks just run flat out, knowing that on Sunday, I can just collapse and spend time with my family and rest. And I'm not allowed to draw. I don't draw on Sundays. So, yeah, Sundays are extra, extra sweet these days. Do you have a day set aside or a time of the week set aside to do your painting? Like this is just, because I would imagine there's something very personal about that. This is for me. This is what I'm doing. Or maybe I'm wrong about that, but it would seem to me that like this is something that requires such focus and there's a degree of intimacy to it as well. Or is it just whenever it comes up during the week? No. Yeah, generally the weekends are when I paint these days, but it's either, but that is flexible as well. So, I've been doing just early mornings, you know, I'm up early working, then the kids are up getting them ready for school, then it's off to work with Canon Press and then home for dinner, spending time with the family until they're in bed. And then maybe I'll do a little bit of work, but usually I try to get to bed early so that I can get up early again the next day. The rhythms of a professional artist sound like a professional anything. Amazing. Yes, it turns out it's work. You mean you're not just, you know, up at three o'clock in the morning waiting for the muse to appear? Well, no, I am. But it's, yeah, sometimes it shows up. But I'm there whether or not the muse is there. That's the goal. And you're working on just real quickly, you're working on animation now. So I think you had mentioned earlier that you wanted to be getting into animation and now you finally worked your way around to that. Yeah, it's, I'm very grateful for how that's worked out. So we don't, nothing is nailed down yet, but we're all hopeful we have projects that we like. But it's, yeah, I'm doing traditional hand-drawn animation and it's extremely fun. Some of the most fun I've had in my entire career, I would say. So. So hand-drawn like cell animation? Yes. Yeah, so it's not, it's not on paper. We're, you know, we're drawing directly on the computer. But still, all we're doing is we're skipping the scanning process. Other than that, it's the same. So. Oh my goodness. See, that is something. So now I'm going to say that is something I could never do. Yeah, it is absurd. I can't, it doesn't, yeah, it's a lot of work. Yes. A lot of very detail-oriented micro work in a way, just the subtle changes of a facial expression. Oh, I couldn't do it. Right. And back to how we started this conversation. This is why when I'm painting, I'm trying to be sloppy and loose and relax and just have fun. Because during my day job, I'm worrying about, you know, turning a character in three-dimensional space on a page and it's just, there's math involved, you know, it's complicated. See, that makes a lot of sense. Like we started talking about the difference between like a crispen and the impressionistic painting in the gallery. That makes a lot of sense to me that, you know, producing something as detail-oriented and as precise as this, how appealing it would be if you're always in the headspace to be drawing or painting to produce something so much more loose and evocative, I guess. Right. Well, this has been fantastic. I know you've got a lot of work to do today. Thank you so much for the generosity of your time and walking me and walking us through your artwork. Is there some place that people can go online to find a gallery of your paintings or images of your paintings or something like that? Yeah, forestdickison.com is, you can go there. There's a newsletter to sign up for. The only time I send out a newsletter is when I have new paintings, which is rare these days. But then you can find me on Instagram. I do have a Twitter, but mostly I repost paintings of dead people. So that's not really my own work. Oh, paintings of dead people? Yeah, the masters, the old, the old dead guys who really knew how to paint. You know, I just repost what I like on my Twitter. So paintings of dead people. I should say paintings by dead people. That's not a terrible. Whatever, we don't need to go there. Paintings by old masters who are now deceased, but because their paintings are still around, they've stood the test of time and they're great paintings of dead people. That's terrible. What is the way to sign off? No, it's so good. That's great. Who are some of your favorite masters? My favorite dead people. Yes, exactly. Your favorite paintings of dead people. Oh, jeez. Oh, it's so good. That's great. Yeah, I love John Singer Sargent. I love Joaquin Sorolla. I love the old Japanese masters, Yoshida Hiroshi in particular. I love the California Impressionists. So Edgar Payne, William Wint are some of my favorites. NC Wyeth. I love the end pages of Christmas or any day are a nod to NC Wyeth. Okay. And recently I've been reading a biography of the artist Maynard Dixon who was painting a little before NC Wyeth in the American Southwest. Yeah, those are some of my go-tos. I've always been a big fan of Alfred Bierstadt and Casper David Friedreich. I originally liked the wonder about the Sea of Fog. I think that's still a classic painting, but there are so many others of his that they're so beautiful. Yeah, that's a good one. And Bierstadt's landscapes of the American West is like time traveling. Yeah, those are great. Wonderful. Well, thank you so much again for your time. Be sure to send people to your website and your Twitter. Thank you so much, Forrest. Yeah, thanks for having me, Will. Take care. Lord bless you. Take care.
