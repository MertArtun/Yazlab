 Welcome to Art2Heart, the podcast where we explore the intricacies of life's canvas, how to express, redefine and embrace our journeys through art and conversations. I am your host Reena and today we are diving deep into the transmissive power of starting over. Whether you are facing a career change, moving to a new city or seeking a fresh chapter in your life, this episode will help you paint a new picture of what's possible. Starting over isn't just about change, it's about renewal, creativity and courage. So let's create something beautiful together in today's canvas. I saw this illustration in Penetra's and I thought this relates so much to what we are currently in our life. If you're someone who is trying to add this new chapter in your life or to do something which you have been putting for so long just because you're afraid or lack of confidence, this illustration which actually depicts like you can start with a blank canvas and at the end you will have a light full of path to what you have created and worked hard for. So let's start by acknowledging something important. Change can be uncomfortable. It is easy to feel stuck like you're on a treadmill going nowhere but the truth is sometimes change is exactly what we need to grow. You should come out of your comfort zone. You should be out there in rain, in sun to seek what you are actually built for. Imagine standing at a crossroad where every path is unfamiliar. The fear of the unknown can be paralyzing but it's also where opportunity lies. One of the things I learned from my life is I was 28 once and now I'm standing at 31 and during my peak of my YouTube career I kind of stopped posting entirely and took a big break. I never thought that it would take me two long years to come back to start doing what I really had enjoyed but at the same time taking care of your health, emotions or whatever is happening is very much a priority. Of course you may be a part of working culture which is not so helpful in following your hobbies or in following your dreams but at the same time, build is something which is daunting every single month, every single day of your life. To focus on what is at the current situation, we kind of lost ourselves into figuring out what do we actually really want to do but at the same time doing something which is not in your favor does not mean that you're not doing what you actually want to do. It's something that you are just unstoppable and it's there built in you somewhere that you can actually become the person you want to and all you have to do is just wake up one day and decide no I will start it from today. Like this is what I did at the beginning of August saying no I will post a video every single day no matter what, where, how, when but I'll make sure to appear myself in front of my audience in front of my supporters and that has been life changing from past 70 days plus hours so far. I have been able to skip one or two videos here and there just because I didn't have enough time or I just had too much in my brain but in the majority of the time I have always always uploaded and I think I met a lot of new people, I have a lot of support in my community which I am thankful for. So in your scenario you will definitely be struggling to even think of what you actually want to do but it's just a moment of a second in your brain where you say no I am capable enough to do it and I will do it today not tomorrow. Consider these three powerful mindset shifts. First from fear to curiosity. Replace what if I fail with what can I learn. This simple change opens the door to exploration. One thing I did in last December is take up a new design course by Google and Coursera. It's a complete new chapter but at the same time I have built many landing page or newsletter page or something we call as weekly mailers in our organization where I happen to build a low code, no code HTML mailers and I do know the basic stuff of drag and drop like if you look at fix, if you look at WordPress, if you look at other website, they do hosting or they do talk about all you have to do is just drag and drop you can build but this is not actually like the landing page is not actually like that. It's actually understanding what the user need from you. That's what I learned in UX design. Before that I have no idea what's happening. I would build but do I really know what is something which I should look forward to. That's when after doing the course of the certification of UX design I kind of understand it's an empathy. It's a brainstorming. It's an idea which makes people to stay longer in your website and actually take that call to action button. Something you learn without even realizing. It's been over eight months, nine months since I started implementing this and like I still don't have a particular portfolio on that course. Despite I should have built two or more websites or two or more design I have not done because I'm still in the process of learning but does not stop me from not actually learning something. So the point from fear to curiosity rather than feeling yourself you can just stumble upon open that page, take up the course and start learning without even thinking further. Number two is from isolation to connection. Seek out communities whether online or in person. You'll find others who are also on the journey of reinvention. I can actually relate to this from the above example about UX design. I kind of start building my LinkedIn, still my LinkedIn optimization is a joke and they will try to search me in LinkedIn but I kind of stumble upon a username named shy and the team are developing a design for you for the designer UX UI people where we can actually build our portfolio with just few drag and drop. It is more like a notion but also it's much more simpler and much more easier and I happen to attend there. There have been hours where he talked about how you can make few changes in your portfolio and you will end up getting job. Now I'm a part of this design for your community even though I don't text them anything or I don't ask any question but I get to see a like-minded people who have done, created all this amazing thing happening in the brain and they happen to do exactly what I'm currently learning. Last and number three from perfection to progress. Notice the idea it's okay to be imperfect every step forward no matter how small is progress. Like I said I stopped posting two years ago and this August I started to implement this tiny step where I like even for a short I will appear in your subscription page and I'll make sure that you guys click that and you guys support me back again even though I might have left my channel at the peak but I no longer prefer perfectionism because I want the progress I want that graph to be slightly growing rather than being like a dead straight lane. Now let's get practical here are ten actionable steps to help you start over with confidence. Number one reflect and define your goals. Take time to understand what you truly want journal about your passions and dream. Journaling is something which is such a game changer for anybody who has been doing it's actually you pinning down your feeling and taking away all those negative thoughts out of your brain and just focusing on the thing you want to focus. Number two create a plan. Break down your goals into manageable steps having a roadmap can make the journey less overwhelming. Like I said journaling is a key point and everyone should have a dirty notebook or some of the scribble notebook but you can just write whatever you are going through and then you will actually get all the guts and then you will just be focusing on the good. Number three build a support system. Surround yourself with people who uplift and inspire you don't be afraid to lean on them when times get tough. For me it is always listening to the podcast or reading some books on productivity on learning something you like show your work by asking Clion or feel good productivity by Ali Abdel and there is one book which I really enjoy don't overthink and those are some of the key points you can surround yourself if you're introvert you will definitely don't want to be with people because your energy is driving out and if you are extrovert you will definitely seek out for people's support around you who can actually understand what your goals and aims are. Number four celebrate small domains. Every little achievement counts acknowledging your progress no matter how many are. I'm someone who always think of celebrating too long is absolutely madness and being sad too long is also absolutely madness. Celebrating those right if you're going to celebrate for 10 minutes you just have to feel sorrow for 10 minutes but our brain does not work further. We celebrate for 10 minutes and we actually keep on thinking of the thing we have not achieved for 10 hours and 10 days. If you're someone who actually don't see your progress write it down at the beginning of the month and see at the end of the month how far you have come you will actually see a difference in it and you will really be happy for what you have done. You should not do to seek approval from other but rather from yourself because you are your own best critic out there. Number five stay open to new opportunities. Life is unpredictable embrace the unexpected twists and turns. If you have lost your job no worries you can actually upskill yourself go to a better job and where you feel actually feel accomplished for what you have done. Number six practice self-compassion. Be kind to yourself during this transition. Acknowledge your feelings and allow yourself to grieve what you are leaving behind. Number seven learn continuously. This is my favorite bit. Invest in yourself through courses, book or workshop. Knowledge can empower you to make informed decisions in your new journey. Number eight visualize your future. In time imagining what your ideal life will look like. Visualization can clarify your goals and motivate you to take action. Number nine limit comparison. We all do this mistake. Focus on your own journey rather than comparing yourself to others. Everyone's path is unique and that's what makes it special. There are few in our class or in our college who have achieved more than what we are doing today. So stop comparing because they have already put that number of effort. For example if you took at Ali Abdal he started working from the age of 14. Now he's 30 and I can't really compare to him saying hey I'm elder than Ali and I have not done what I have done but looking at his work experience he has been working for pretty good of a two decade close by. What if I look at my own and not even work for five years down the road. So whatever you put in your hard work that's where it will. Number 10 stay flexible. Be willing to adapt your plans as you learn and grow. Flexibility can lead to new opportunities you had not considered. Flexibility does not mean you're not going to become the person you have trimmed off but it's actually becoming the best version of yourself which you have not trimmed off because you are constantly building up yourself. For example I would say you have planned to achieve your body image or you have planned to achieve your academic performance by saying okay I'm going to do this in a year but in a year you will actually excel yourself with more than you have actually thought about because human being are built with the capacity of unknown and you can actually become the version you have never dreamed of that will be the mega version of yours or I would call it as a superstar version of yours which you have never ever thought of. So don't be literally yourself don't think it's not possible just because you're starting over just do this 10 points focus on what you actually want take time build yourself tiny tiny bit at a day you will actually see progress and you will eventually get out of your cocoon and achieve to what you are actually born for. Never starting over isn't about erasing the past it's about building a future that aligns with who you are now. Embrace the journey, trust the process and don't be afraid to redefine what success looks like for you.
