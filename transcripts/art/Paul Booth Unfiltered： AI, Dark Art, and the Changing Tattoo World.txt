 What's up guys and welcome back to the honest tattooer podcast. My name is John Messa, I'm with my co-host Matt Riano. What up, what up, what up? Our Boi G Money in the house. That's good. Our guest today has been in the tattoo industry for several decades and it's a very, very well-known figure in the world of tattooing and especially probably known as the father of like dark art in tattooing. Legendary. Legendary. And I know, right? That's what I should hit it. But welcome, Pal Booth, to the podcast, man. Thanks, man. Thanks for having me. No, thanks so much for coming by. So for the people that don't know you, let them know where you're from, how long you've been tattooing and what kind of tattoos do you do? Well, I'm Paul Booth. I'm based out of New York City, although right now I'm in New Jersey since COVID and I've been tattooing 36 years now as of next week. Wow, 36 years. Yeah. When I was 19, I was a repo man and I stole cars for a living basically and I painted murals on hot rods and shit like that, an airbrush artist. And I got this chick pregnant at 19 and had the kid and I was freaking out about it because I was 19. I wasn't ready to be a dad, but I wasn't going to run away either. So my friend suggested I get her name tattooed on me to kind of cope with it. And I thought, yeah, that's a commitment, maybe it'll help. I got her name tattooed on me and I got to customize the design and everything. It was like, wow, this is neat. The whole process blew me away. The pain, the ritual. This was your first tattoo? Yeah, yeah. Wow. Picking a design off the wall and customizing it. And I fell in love with the whole thing. I didn't even think about it as a career. I just needed to know how to do it. Yeah. It was simple as that. And I picked it up. I started drawing my tattoos and then I started hanging around the shop. I paid him, it was five grand at the time. Back when you used to pay to apprentice. To apprentice. Yeah. It was back before everyone was giving shit away for free. But basically, I took the apprenticeship and within three months I was tattooing. And shortly after that I was getting paid to do it. And two and a half years later I was managing the shop. So then I left, I went to California, my old man was sick and needed me to try and take care of him. So I moved to California and it was the first time I had. Well, I should say the shop I learned in was a very traditional street shop. Designs on the wall, everything. And coffee cans for ashtrays nailed to the wall. Nicotine stains on the flash, the plastic over the flash. Acetate stencils. Indoor smoking was that. 1988. Wow. So can we expand this? You're the first person to ever mention acetate stencils. For people who are young and don't know what that is, explain what that is. Well basically the only thing we had back then was you take a sheet of plastic and you would scratch with a nail, lay it over the design and scratch it in with a nail on the plastic. And then you'd grease the arm Vaseline or Menin Speedstick. You would powder charcoal powder that's scratched in design on the plastic and press it onto the skin. And that's what you had for a stencil. You'd be lost. But it taught you to be precise and efficient and not sloppy because the slightest wrong move and you lose your stencil. Yeah, you got to think about that. That taught me a lot. Your hand placement. Absolutely. Start at the bottom right if you're right handed and work your way up to the top left. Controlled wiping too. You don't want to wipe all that away. Right. Exactly. That's how I learned by wrapping a paper towel around my tattoo hand. And I would blot with my pinky as I worked. And that's where that came from. I don't see anyone else do it but me. But I'm still doing it. How many years into tattooing were you when you could say your vision of what you wanted your tattooing to really be like? That was when I left the shop two and a half years later. I moved to California. That was when all of a sudden I was in a shop that the guy was a hack really. And it was a shop and it was like the only one in town that would have me. So I went there and I just had all the freedom in the world to do whatever I wanted. So it took some of my friends that I made while I was living there. About a year and a half I was there. Santa Barbara. And I did some free tattoos on them and brought them to a show in Anaheim. It's my first tattoo convention. And I got a bunch of attention. I was surprised. I wasn't expecting anything. But it was the first time I had the freedom to take my own drawings and do it my way. I didn't have a boss looking over me, get him out of the chair, we're making money, money, money, that kind of thing. So I just was able to explore my art more after that. I mean I don't regret those two and a half, three years that I had doing Tasmanian devils and hearts and roses. I didn't even really complain at the time because I knew I needed to do it to build a foundation. And I basically, I must have done 5,000 Tasmanian devils really. The first one was an attempt at what was on the wall and the last one was ripped with veins. Like a jack. Yeah, a jack. And you know, 5,000 of them later. I'm sure some Tweety Birds were sprinkled in there. Yeah, yeah. I even did a couple Christ portraits, man. So how did the industry first embrace your work? Because I feel like your work was completely different than what anybody else was doing. Yeah, yeah. I've always been on my own trip, not for any other reason, but it's my art. I don't know how else to do it. I just do my own thing. Pittsburgh 91 convention. And I went there, well I came home from California and my job was not waiting for me as promised. Here's the boss's son moved home and took my seat and that was that. So I was doing tattoo parties, biker parties, you know, kitchen magician shit to pay the bills. But I didn't have a shop to work in and I really wanted to be in a shop again, you know. So I went, I had my girlfriend at the time, I did a big back piece on her and brought her to the Pittsburgh show just to try and find a job. What was the back piece? It was a steaming going up her side with peeled skin and just some nonsense really. And you know, but she was hot and at the time a hot chick and a good big tattoo couldn't really fail. Yeah, you can't miss it. And that still works today. And not that that was the plan, but it just kind of worked out that way. And I brought her to the convention and she was a hit and I couldn't believe it. I wasn't expecting anything. Honestly, because I was doing my own freehand work, I didn't really expect anyone to like it. I was just again doing my thing. If someone likes it, cool, you know, that's enough for me. And it was she couldn't walk five feet without another photo. I won all these awards, you know, I didn't even plan on entering her, but everyone was insisting and you know, all these trophies and shit. And next thing I know, she's on the cover of the next magazine. And it was funny because like they put me and her on the inside of the cover stand in there. She was on the cover. And everyone knew the tattoo from that, but didn't know who the hell I was, you know, so it was a weird beginning. But I got an interview, the magazine embraced me and the artists that I looked up to like Jack Rudy and guys like that that were at the show in Pittsburgh were inviting me to come to their shop. And I'm just this kid out of nowhere. I didn't really, I didn't know anybody or nothing, you know. And I had several of these people inviting me to do guest spots. And I jumped on it. I took my van and I toured the country by van like a few times and learning as I went, I probably learned more after I left that shop than what I learned traditionally as an apprentice. Like I kind of relearned everything from old people I was meeting. It was great. And then it went from touring the country to getting invited overseas. My first international show was Amsterdam with Hanky Panky. I don't remember what year. Wow. A year or two after 91, 92, 93. It was 93, I think. Then from there I launched into getting invited to conventions in other places in Europe. Which expanded to the world. And I've been traveling the world for 30 years. Incredible. Wow. It's crazy. Yeah. Anna's tattoo is brought to you by Tattoo Smart. They offer digital design tools for the professional tattooer, helping you save time and make your clients happy.

I love Thailand. I love Australia. I love the country of Ireland. The people are a little too conservative for me there, but a lot of Catholicism, which I don't vibe well with. It's embedded. Oh, yeah, these kids don't know my history. No, they don't. I'm basically pretty known for having an extreme dislike for the church. Not God in particular, just religion and general... Just organized kind of structural religion. I have trouble with all that. But I've always had trouble with authority figures anyway, so I have the same problem with cops a lot too. It just extends throughout the whole collection. When did Last Rights come to be? Last Rights started, I think, legitimized in 94. Maybe it was 93. Started out as dark images and then came up with... You decided to shift from traveling to... I'm going to settle down. Yeah, I didn't have... If you look in the old magazines back then, the early 90s, they would put the artist's name under the photo and where they're from. Where I was from was always like, Terrarville or hell. I didn't have a shop, so the magazine would just make up crazy places. No one knew where I was from. That's kind of cooler though. It's actually pretty cool. Dark catacombs. Right, right, right. So much probably looking at me like, what am I doing? Yeah, we just make shit up. That's awesome. So then that came to like, I need to settle a place somewhere for myself. Yeah, for me, it blew up so fast that all I was ever doing was trying to keep up with it. Yeah. One thing, I start by looking for a job with a tattoo on my girlfriend. Even within a couple years, I'm doing interviews on the news in the middle of Europe somewhere. And I'm just all of a sudden, I have a red carpet rolled down in front of me everywhere I go. Not all of a sudden, but it took a few years. But I mean, it turned into that. Some people never get to experience that at all. No, no. It was pretty peculiar. I try, through the years, I've always beaten myself up enough to try and remain somewhat humble, but I could be a dick if I wanted to. The shit I've experienced in this career is like, I can't even talk to people about it because it sounds like bragging, because it's out of the ordinary shit. Because I mean, look, you go to conventions and half the time, at least back in the day, they were funded by organized crime one way or another. And I'd be all over the world and I'd be sitting down having dinner with all kinds of people that would be questionable. And I got to know a lot of them. But what was the point of that? I should have mentioned to you before we started, I have memory problems. No, but we were talking about after traveling, you decide to settle down and you start working on last rights as your place to be. Right. Last rights, I wanted to bring, I always liked bringing people together like-minded people. And I wanted to open a shop that represented dark art, what I obviously do and did. But also, the aesthetic is my passion. So my shop was always an extension of me. That's how it got so decorated and the decor is always over the top and dark and creepy. But it extended first from a tattoo shop where I was really just partly trying to advance in my career and open a shop. I had so much attention on me, it only made sense to do. And then some years after that, I ended up adding an art gallery to it. And that's when I was really driven. The reason I opened the art gallery was because I'm an only child and I've got the syndrome bad. So I'm like somebody that if you say no to me, I have a hard time with it. It's like, what do you mean no? Anyway, I was always told that we weren't real artists because we worked on skin. We weren't recognized in the art world or considered, we were scoffed at. Piss me off. Did you try? Because I mean, you've been painting and oiled for a long time and like your art is so definitive you, which has a voice, which I think is so valuable in all of the art world outside of even tattooing. Did you try to get into galleries like in the New York air like scene? Oh yeah. That was what spurred me on to open a gallery was because I'd walk into a gallery wearing rotten sneakers. I got a wad of 10 grand in my pocket ready to buy art. But in the art world, if you're not wearing the right shoes, you don't get any attention. So general rule of thumb, they don't take you seriously. You don't have money. Yeah. And it would piss me off. I didn't like the way people were so rude and snobby in the art world. So I said, you know what, motherfuckers? I'm going to open my own gallery. It's going to be a family business and a family oriented idea. And it's going to be from tattoo artists. So you can kiss my ass, you know? The rebellion and the angst and the contempt that I'm fueled by generally is what drove me to open the art gallery. It works. I think a lot of awesome things came from that moment in tattooing. And when you were doing all these things, like one, I think like I've always taken that idea of like creating a shop that's an extension of you. Like, you know, and I feel like you did that so well, you know, like going to last rights was a memorable experience for anybody when they first entered from like the beginning, you know, till it was just awesome. Thank you. Atmosphere. That was the whole inspiration. I've never been there, but I've talked to enough people who have been there who describe the place in such detail. I feel like I've seen it. Right on. Yeah. My vision of it is pretty fucking cool. Thanks. Yeah, it's really always been about the experience, you know. I've always said that a tattoo should be more than just an improv improvisational moment, you know, or, hey, I'm just getting pulsively going to get a tattoo and run in a shop. I mean, yeah, that's street shops and that's cool. Not wrong with that. Yeah. But I wanted to take it a step further where it's like a special day you mark down on your calendar and say, hey, you know, it's Last Writes Day. Yeah. And I tried to make the shop a whole experience for them, you know, horror movies playing and metal music or whatever have you, dark music. And I had a home theater built into my shop so people could watch the horror movies. And, you know, it was very theatrical. It was called the Last Writes Tattoo Theater for a reason, you know. I had planned on but had no success at the time. I'm sure someone will probably steal this now, but whatever. I wanted to have a troupe of actors in the shop. And I wanted like two old Italian ladies that would come out and cry next to you while you're getting tattooed. Funeral grandmas, you know. Funeral grandmas. Yeah. Or a guy with a violin strolling through the shop or a Vincent Price character reading Poe out of a book, you know. Just shit like that all day. Like every Saturday was going to be theatrical day. But I never got the crew together, you know. Yeah, that sounds like a lot of work. Yeah, yeah. It's like it would be fun writing the skits, you know. So your first dark images, it was in the East Village, right? Yeah. Yeah. And you were there for how many years? That place, I was there nine years, I believe. Nine years. Yeah, I think so. So it was from 91? From 90, no, no, 91 was when I named last, right, 94 was when I named last rights, but it wasn't a shop yet. 98, I opened up in New York when it legalized. Okay. And I'd been on 4th Street from 98 to 2006. And then I moved for the gallery to open the art gallery. I moved to a bigger spot by 33rd Street and 10th. And where it's now it's Hudson Yards. Now that's Hudson Yards. Destroyed. But it was fun because I was in an industrial space. So I had the floor to myself at night, you know, at five o'clock hit the building emptied. So I could probably. There was like nobody in that area. It was a wild space. Yeah, yeah. If you didn't know me, you'd never find me. I didn't even have a sign. Yeah. But that was the mystique, you know, it was what it was about. You open the elevator door opens and there's last rights, you know, New York. It's some amazing sculptures there. Yeah. Yeah. We had a lot of Giger stuff. Yes. Awesome. You know, it was it was special, you know, I had a lot of fun with it. I'd redesign it every five years, revamp the whole place into something different because I get bored. Yeah. And I just faced that six months ago in my art studio now, my private studio. I'm like, now what, you know? So I added black lights and crazy shit like that. Tattoo armor is literally the best way to wrap your client. I've been using it. Matt's been using it and it's just awesome. There's no mess. There's no glue and it's just super comfortable. I hope you can try it for yourself and just go on to tattoo armor and use the code on a tattoo for 20 percent off your order. I mean, through your through last rights, you kind of opened the doors for many of the most famous tattooers, you know, let the guys that group kind of were good and kind of started working there and kind of they really took off. I'm like that old garage band that every rock star once played in. That's what it is. But you always had an eye for a lot of talent. And how did you, how would you say it's a good way to hire people or to seek out for artists that are going to work at your shop? I had trouble because I had, basically I had a high rent in New York. It's no joke. I mean, 5,000 square feet in midtown is really no joke. And it would take me a year, year and a half to find a replacement when someone left because no one's good enough. I get thousands of portfolios, but maybe a dozen are worth calling, you know, not to be a dick about it. But yeah, you have to filter it out. You have to filter it out, you know. And but for me, it's not just about being a good tattooer. It's having a good character too. Yeah, that's important. Yeah. And it makes it hard. But because of the rent and everything, I had to hire some people that I knew I'd regret hiring. And that's when it really got to the point where these particular artists kind of sucked the life out of the shop for me. There was no more paint nights. There was no more real camaraderie. There was headphones on for every tattoo and leaving my clients out of the picture. And that whole special experience was gone. So you're getting lost. And because the shop is an extension of me, as the shop suffered, I suffered. And it I went into depression. I was tattooing minimally at the time. And then COVID came along and I'm like, yeah, fuck this. I'm done. You know, Tough moment. I knew that. Yeah, you know, I mean, I would have kept going if it wasn't for COVID. But you know, I basically after it all happened, I was like relieved. I mean, all of a sudden I had this freedom and I got my art back. I'm tattooing and painting full time. It's awesome. Again, you know, and I'm feeling my art more than I have in years. And it's been the best move I ever made. I mean, I'm so happy now and stress free. You know, I built a art studio in my basement. I'm I stroll downstairs and tattoo all day. It's fucking great. That's awesome. And I'm dealing with real people like serious people. I'm doing big tattoos. So it's not like a walk in shop in my house. Mm hmm. You know, it's like I'm dealing with people that are spending a lot of money and serious about their art, you know, so it's not so bad. Yeah. How does that feel having all these people come to your house though? Creepy. Yeah, right. But I like creepy. OK. You know, I say he tries to scare them more than they would. Yeah. They're more worried about me. Will you ever get out alive? We might not make it out of. Yeah. Sometimes they bring their friends and their friends don't know me or anything about me and they'll come in and sit down and they're between a tiger's paw and a taxidermied baby. What a casket in front of them, you know, like, what am I doing here? You know, and my humor is so dark and sarcastic, they don't know what to make of me. Man, I feel like you have a presence about you that when you enter a room, you know, everybody's like, yes, enter the room. Well, you know what it is? My my defense mechanism, because I don't do good with crowds. I get a lot of social anxiety, actually. And my defense mechanism is to toughen up and make the hairs on my back stand up. You know what I mean? So I'm always like, people say I'm unapproachable, but it's not that I'm unapproachable. It's just that I'm like guarded. Yeah. Because I just don't do well with people, you know, one on one. I'm fine. Like as a tattooer, I learned that. But doing a seminar. Yeah. I'm like a nervous little girl trying to do a seminar, you know, talking in front of everybody like a fish in an aquarium. You know, I've had bands drag me on stage and I freak out, you know. That's something I wanted to touch on, actually. I mean, like you've tattooed some of the world's Pages Rock stars. Yeah. Which is wild. How how did that even start happening? The magazine exposures. Igor Cavallero. From Sepultura. I was at a convention in California once again. And we had a mutual friend. And she he wanted to meet me. So she and I didn't know he was even there, but he wanted to meet me and get tattooed. She brought him to me and I freaked out because I was a huge fan of Sepultura. Yeah. You know. And we hit it off. We became friends immediately. I tattooed him, invited me out to the house. I've tattooed Max and Igor and the family at their house. And they invited me out on the road with them to go on tour in 94. Wow. And that was my first tour. And it was Pantera, Sepultura and Biohazard. And I was out on that tour. And that was when I first met in Selmo and a bunch of people, you know, we hit it off, I ended up going to his place and, you know, tattooing him at his place. And I'd make house calls, you know, or what have you because I was loving, you know, the whole experience. Yeah. Yeah, that's incredible. For a fat guy from New Jersey to be like hanging out with his idols. Yeah. You know, it's like, wow, this is pretty cool. You know, absolutely. And then we just became friends. So it's not like idols anymore. They are when I listen to the music. Yeah. But but it's like, you know, we have normal friendships, you know, and mutual respect. Yeah. Yeah. That's incredible. What do you think it's the major but misconception from people about you as an artist? I don't actually eat babies. Some people believe I do. But I'll say it here now. I have yet to eat a baby. Not that I ever want, but I have yet to eat one. No, I don't know misconceptions about me. It's funny. I have a lot of haters out there and the majority of them have never even fucking met me. You know, that's always the case, right? Yeah. But, you know, I. I hear things about me. I feel like the king of the rumor mill. I've heard I'm a gay heroin addict. And I'm like, yeah, I'm the world's fattest heroin. I've heard I eat babies. I've heard I have massive orgies, which isn't necessarily. Oh, I hear all this shit about me. And it was a point where I was even starting my own rumors to see what would happen to them when they got back to me. The telephone game, you know, how do you feel about the current state of mentorships and because we touched on it just briefly right before we started of the way that kind of tattooing has opened up. I feel like you started in a point of tattooing that it was very, you know, it was guarded. It was it was being kind of. Kate kept, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, I well, I'll tell you. I have positive and negative thoughts about it, you know, I and I'm not going to sit on the fence. I'll tell you exactly what I think, you know, back in my day. And I think even today still tattooing itself is an artisan's craft. You know, it's like stone cutters that built that do gravestones and monuments and granite and stuff like that. Yeah, stone masons. You don't just learn that, you know, you've got to like apprentice. You've got to, you know, learn from the masters and they pass the torch to you. And tattooing was like that. And then let's see, the first move that I recognized as the problem was the big. Do you remember the DVD craze of how to video? Yes. Yep. You know, the guy who started that came to me years later, complaining about how all these new kids suck. And I'm like, really, maybe you shouldn't have taught him for 100 bucks. You know what I mean? So like. I was actually I wanted to ask Russ this last night because he made a DVD. So you're saying there is one guy behind all. I can't name him. He's a friend. But but there is a person. There's one one person. I remember the first guy that did it. Yeah. And then everyone jumped on board and everyone was selling their how to videos DVDs. I guess the question that I'm asking is was there like. Was there like a publisher who was behind all of these people? Because it's not it was all self public. It was all self. OK, that's what I was. OK, it was just homemade DVDs. I know. I feel like they looked similar, like the covers looked similar, like it was all produced by the same person. Not just everyone follows along. Yeah. You know, how many original bones are there? You know, that that would redo it a new way. You know, so it just became a craze. After I got the chance to sit down with Matt and John on the honest tattoo or podcast, the force of focus got amazing feedback when it comes to the whole to heal the process and networking strategies and most of all, creating your own personal brand and culture. So I want to give you the opportunity to take 15% off by coming to join the force of focus arena. Now, this is a community of high achieving tattoo artists who were all here for one reason, to be around like minded individuals who all want to grow, not only in our personal lives, but within our businesses. We're going to walk with you side by side to build out every system you could ever imagine to not only ensure the fact you're on the right path, but how to be able to see your dream life and then achieve it. Now, I have a laundry list of artists who have been able to achieve their dreams. And if you're ready to do the same, click the link below and let's get a conversation. Go. I I'm not a gatekeeper. I'm really not. But like, there should be some degree of protection for the industry's sake, the art's sake. I don't think someone tattooing for three years should have three apprentices under them. I don't think they've been in long enough, but I see that now all over the place. It's more and more common. And, you know, I mean, OK, you learn for free. That's fine, too. But like, I think you should pick and choose who you teach because I want the people I teach to be a credit to the industry as a teacher. I want my student to surpass me. Otherwise, why am I teaching? Yeah, you know, I want to build a monster. And that's how I approached every apprenticeship that I had. And out of the five I had, only half of one succeeded, you know. And but I'm like, since I grasshopper shit, you know, it's not like, here's how you poke holes in skin. OK, go do your thing. It's not a two month deal. It's years, you know. So I'm probably overly critical and demanding. And but I'll break you and I'll build you up again into a monster. I know I will because that's my mission. That's OK. You know, I think that's good, though, because the reason why I wouldn't take on an apprentice is because I feel like I don't have the skills to teach someone well enough that when that person goes out into the world, other people not only respect them as a tattooer, but look at them as like, oh, shit, Matt, Matt, Matt taught that guy. Right. Yeah. And then that's a costention of me. If that guy looks like an idiot, then I look like an idiot, too. Yeah. And it's hard. Yeah. And, you know, back in the day, there was a chain of who taught who. Yes. You know, I learned from Ernie White. He learned from I don't remember and so on. It was like a family tree in tattooing. That's wiped out. That's gone. Yeah. You know, these new kids don't know what it was like. When it was smaller community and like anything, though, as it gets bigger and trendier, it dilutes. Right. Right. And then with the advent of certain TV shows, you've got Riff Raff coming into the industry because the artists on the shows are tricked by the producers into being douchebags for their 15 minutes. They'll do it just to be on TV, but they're destroying the industry because they're making us look like a bunch of assholes. You know, I know that's harsh and extreme, but and perhaps it is. But, you know, what happens is you got these douchebags at home. Watching this and going, hey, wait a minute, I'm a douchebag. I could be a tattoo artist, too. And here we are. You know, I want to be a rock star. The floodgates opened and here we are. It's inevitable. You know, even predictable, really. But I believe and here's the positive coming finally. I believe we're headed for a new tattoo renaissance because what's happening now is all that Riff Raff that came in and poisoned the industry are getting bored because they're not the rock stars. They thought they'd be number one and number two. They're getting starved out because businesses, you know, there's a bit of a tattoo recession. A lot of shops are slow. Yeah. And it's weeding out the Wigglies, you know, correct, weeding out the worms, man, because like they're going to they don't have the attention span to stick with this. It still takes a special kind of person to be a true tattooer. Yeah. I believe that. And they're not it. So they're all going to fade away as the trend fades as it is. And they're going to fade away. And what's going to be left is the cream of the crop that stuck around because they're committed to it. The bones, the bones. Yeah. What's crazy is some of the people who've been in it for a long time, they're starting to back out now also. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, you know, one of the problems I see, some people don't realize I see it because I'm out there on occasion anyway. At the same time, we had all this riff raff come into the industry. All of the old timers left because they didn't want to deal with the bullshit of the riff raff. So there's no one left to pass the torch. So the new kids that are a credit to the industry are able to be one, have no old timers around to tell them the stories and teach them the shit like I learned. I was over here. I would, you know, Eve's drop on artists talking to each other and listen. Or I didn't intervene and ask questions, you know, it's not that, you know, there's the old timers bailed. I'm one of the few that are left out there, you know, unless you're going to an old timer specific convention, but the bigger conventions, how many old timers do you see it? Not that none. There's almost no one there to smack these kids into shape. No, but I think also that some there's there's a lack of just respect and value. Yeah. Well, that's society in general. Society in general, the way that they treat their elders, you know, right? You know, and I don't think that's that's in every culture, but it's definitely not culture here in America. It feels like, you know, it's just, it's also just a new thing. I mean, like the younger generation, just they lack respect for, for oh, geez, of and across the board, across the board of anything, of anything. Yeah. What do you know? Yeah. The young each the old, you know, how the nature is. Yeah. Only reason we have a platform is because other people built this platform for us to get on. Right. Right. That's it's crazy. It's it's pretty normal for the youth to not see that. It's this and new. That's true. I you know, what's new is that the entitlement and the lack of work ethic in today's youth, right? I think is what's new because I grew up. I earned my first car. I wasn't handed to me, you know what I mean? Yeah. I worked for what I got and I'm glad I did because I appreciated that much more. Just like all the Tasmanian devils I tattooed, I don't regret one of them. You know, did I hate it at times? Yeah, I wanted to do big back pieces and shit, but, you know, I wasn't ready for it. And like you said, you don't feel comfortable taking on an apprentice because, you know, how you feel with your knowledge base and everything. It's the same kind of thing, you know, it's like. I forgot again. Well, good. I think like we're at a pivotal moment where there's so many new things. I mean, when you started tattooing, you know, like tattoo machines. Now, mainly when you go and everybody's using, you know, pens and dildos. And yeah, yeah. I got a red dildo. You got a red one. Yeah, that's pretty good. I got a black dildo. You got a black. You got two. Right on. Right on. Two. I got two. Got two big black dildos. The best. That's got a black one with green LED. Like that's fancy. Mine has a siren on. Oh, man. And like, I mean, to come from a point and like we're tattooing. I mean, when you started, I'm sure you know, you were doing acetate stetzels. Yeah. You know, to now, you know, having a full iPad to be able to do a million things. And on top of that, we have AI. Mid Journey, all of these tools. How do you feel about the future of tattooing, some of these tools and where we're going? Well, my I explored my fan base first. When NFTs were all the rage, I made a comment because I was planning an NFT thing because I got the picture where most people hated it because it was new and they didn't understand it. So when hated NFTs and I made a post, right? And I said, what do you guys think of NFTs? And I lost like two or three thousand followers for asking a question. Yeah. And everyone was on me about it. I'm like, Jesus Christ, I didn't even say I was doing anything, you know? So I held off on posting my plan. A few months like just to see if things would die down, because what's the point of promoting it if half your fan base hates you? Yeah. You know, it's like not going to go anywhere. No. Right. So I just waited and then the bottom fell out of NFTs and I managed to squeak by and not have started one. Yeah. But anyway, it's not about NFTs, about AI. And, you know, AI, half my fan base loves it and half my fan base hates it. And it's an interesting place to stand because I personally love it. I use it all the time, but I use it as a tool. It's not. See, people that don't understand how it works or dive into it enough think it's just ripping off artists and cheating, doing the art for you. But for me, what I learned with AI is I use mid journey as my main one for visuals. But what I do is I've added it to my arsenal of tools to create my art. Like I'm using AI to build reference for like a painting or even a tattoo. And then I take that reference and I look at it and I'll draw it on somebody or I'll build the painting using the AI art or designs, I should say. Can't really call it art, you know. Yeah. But, you know, I would take these designs and use them as reference. And just like I use Photoshop. Yeah. And that's not to enhance photos. That's to to make art, you know, and it's just another tool. You know, basically my attitude is that back when photography was invented, all the portrait artists were freaking out like the everyone the artists are now with AI. Everyone was afraid photography was going to steal their jobs. As of today, photography and portrait art simultaneously both still exist and prosper. You know, there's room for it. There's always room for it. It's about adaptation. You know, they say the key to survival, you know. AI is not going anywhere. So either learn how to work with it or get left behind. Yes, it's efficient. It helps me work out ideas. But you have to understand that it's not just draw me a mermaid. Yeah, I can I can tell it what kind of camera to use. I can tell what kind of lighting to use. I can tell how kind of fins are on the mermaid. And, you know, I can detail like crazy and build variations of there's so much you can do. It's like sculpting with words and images. You know, you use the right words and the right commas and the right descriptions changes everything. Yeah, for sure. So if you look at it like that as a tool and as a wordsmithing and image smithing tool, I think it's pretty effective, you know, monetizing it. I haven't figured out other than merch. Yeah, you know, like I doing a bunch of shirt designs built on my AI. But I'm lucky because mid journey was built on 4,000 artists that they taught their styles to OK, to the AI. I am lucky enough to be one of those 4,000. So when I go into mid journey, I'll type in like in the style of Paul Booth and I'll get something sometimes remotely, but often Paul Booth ask images so like I can work with my own style. How do you know that you're one of the artists that was I saw the list? OK. Oh, yeah. Well, without your permission. Yeah, but I'd have given him permission anyway because it's not stealing your art. AI is like having a really good and efficient art assistant. All right. It's like, hey, assistant. Set me up with this. You know, the old masters had apprentices doing their paintings for them. Right. What's new? What happened was they taught the art to the AI. Then they deleted the art and had the AI make derivatives of that art. If you type Paul Booth into mid journey, you're going to get some that might resemble me or Giger is a better example. He's more popular type Giger into mid journey and you'll get Giger ask art influenced by Giger, influenced by Giger, not done by Giger. There's this isn't about stealing from the artist. This is about being influenced by the artist, you know. So I don't see anything wrong with that. I emulated Giger when I was a kid with my airbrush. He's the one who inspired me to use an airbrush in the first place. My attitude is it's just that, you know, it's like an emulation. And I personally don't have a problem with it. And I plan on keeping up with it because I like to adapt to things, you know, and in any business, AI is stealing jobs. Yes, but it's building new jobs, AI oriented jobs. Yeah. So it's about you keeping up with that, learning to utilize AI in your field. I'm using it in tattooing and painting and everything else I'm doing. The book cover for my book, I made an AI invented a girl that I'm in love with, but she's AI, you know, so. Man, sidebar, did you hear about the kid that he created like an AI girl that he fell in love with? Yes, he killed himself. He called her Daenerys Gartagarian and he had her talk like the game of Thrones voice. That's what she was typing in. But. Yeah, the parents should know better. They should have known better. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's like when Judas Priest was blamed for that kid. Yeah, like it's not the AI. No, it's the parents. The parents, dude. Yeah. Give me that computer. I'm going to throw it out the window. Like, dude, trust me, dude. You know, it's funny. You talk about like the AI and helping with your like your ideas and your illustrations. I change it. I don't copy it. Right. I don't take the AI and and duplicate it. Right. I take the eye and use it as reference. There is a difference. It's still my art. No, for sure. And that's, you know, referenced by AI. And that's the the problem with a powerful tool like that is that how many people that, you know, are going to keep it in that respect? Oh, well, that's the problem. You know, I agree with you there that they don't. They just surface, surface value, you know, like, oh, OK, I can just type it, scary mermaid and get a scary mermaid and do a tattoo of it. Right. That's lame to me. Right. When you have all the capabilities in front of you, if you just take the time to learn it, you can do some amazing shit. You know, I've taken my flash, fed it to the AI, taught it to the AI. And now I have AI based new versions of my flash designs, you know. Why? I don't know just to do it. I don't have any plans. Yeah. But it's cool to see the variations on my own art. Yeah. It's refreshing to hear it is I've recently been doing exactly what you're doing, pulling reference from mid journey or chapter PT and then using that to create a new image, but like highly referencing the AI. And a small part of me is like, don't let anybody know that I'm doing it. Yeah. But everybody's using Google for copywritten images reference. And that's worse than using AI because AI is not copyright. Right. It's under your direction. Yeah. You know. So there's like this big problem in the I play this trading card game called Magic the Gathering. And what I love about that game, especially getting into it in the late nineties was the artwork that came with it, like the fantasy work, like Dungeons and Dragons, like the dark art and all like the very like Middle Earthy type of art, very fantasy based. And what I loved about that company is that they would commission illustrators and really good artists, fantasy artists to paint the the the art that would eventually go on the cards. And now fast forward to today. And what you have with AI is you can see the signature all over all the new printings of the new cards and the new concepts, because they almost have like this look of like, if if if you Michael bade the crap out of it. So it's just like. Too many special effects and not enough like soul of the artist on because there was just so so much creative help from the AI. And sometimes, you know, it's you can visually tell you're like, oh, man, this artist didn't he did great. It's a balance between, you know, the AI and your spirit. Yes, your mojo. You know what I mean? Right. But like it can't just be AI and it can just be your mojo, but like or whatever you want to call it, you know, the soul of your art. You know, I think it's a balance between AI as reference and adding your soul to it. Yeah, because that's essentially what it is, you know, you're designing something in AI and then you're reinterpreting it with your soul involved in that AI then becomes part of the journey, but not the result. It's a great tool. Yeah. What a piece of advice would you give a younger artist about just maintaining in this in tattooing? Run away. Please. Like, don't do it. Just go go back. We're full. You know, whatever you were doing. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, there's a art out there that totally blows me away. I mean, there's some amazing artists out there. And I wish more of them showed their work healed. But yes, no less there is same. There is a lot of talent out there. Unfortunately, it's only guys like us that know when it may look good, but you know, it's going to heal like shit. Yes, right. For age like shit. Yeah, absolutely. We can spot it. Man, so I was having a conversation with some guy from Ireland at the convention over the weekend and we were talking about how. He was asking me if I was entering anything into the contest and I was like, I don't really have anybody. Maybe I'll enter the guy that I have tattooing today in one of the categories is not tattoo of the day. And I was like, hopefully they let me do it since it's not a healed piece. He was like, what are you talking about? Like over in Ireland and he maybe in other countries overseas, too, he was saying that. Healed tattoos are like looked down upon at the conventions as far as like entering the contest. What? And then I was trying to like, but how like. Anybody who could do decent art can make a good looking tattoo fresh. Yeah, right. But it's not necessarily always going to look that way after it's healed. Yeah. And he was like, oh, no, like you got to you got to do just fresh tattoos because that's what's important. I was like, what? That is crazy. That's a bunch of bullshit. So you feel like we're at a point where like at a pivotal point to have a new renaissance tattoo. Yeah, I think so. Within the next few years, what does that look like to you? Relief, less bullshit. Yeah. You know, I'm waiting for this trend. Dnes, trendiness of tattooing to fade. Yeah, as all trends do. And I think it's starting to in the mainstream, you know, you get the posers and the bandwagon ears. Yeah, you know, it's all part of the cycle of things. And then next year left with only those that really are credit. Yeah, I agree. I feel like the true will weather the storm after. Yeah, whether the storm, it'll be worth it. It'll be worth it because we love it. You know, and then everyone that's not everyone, but a lot most of the people that are tattooing after this will be worth your time. Like like the the the quality of work is going to rise more exponentially, I think. Maybe that's too much of a word to use at extreme, but but maybe not exponentially, but it's certainly going to continue to rise. Yeah. And it's going to be left for the people that. Should be here. Yes, you know, no more of this. These shenanigans with bullshit tattoos and you know, tattooing has always had its trends. Yes. Even I was a trend, you know, I mean, there's all kinds of trends and it's not a big trend. But I mean, you know, I'm saying like the stylistically biomechanicals, a trend faded trend, you know, but still popular amongst people that like biomechanical. There's always a home for everything. That's like legitimate. Yeah. But like the bullshit, like ignorant style. Yeah. What the hell is that? I want to slap some. It's just scratch. It's random scratcher. It's a scratcher. It's offensive to me. I work hard at this and have for a very long time. And for it proves what a joke it's become. Yeah. That that can actually be popular. Yeah. What do you think makes a tattoo truly remarkable or beyond a tattoo and more smart? Because I feel like you've created that. If you do a tattoo that is not going to look good in 10 years, it's not a tattoo. It's not a good tattoo. You know what I mean? Yeah. You've got to think about 10 years down the road when you do a tattoo. You've got to be thinking about how it's going to age. Because for me, when I started, the permanence of tattooing was kind of an attraction, a big one. And now people argue with me about it. Yeah. Like it's not important anymore. Old timer. Like, OK, I can't argue with you. I guess this is what the new generation is. Yeah, you know, it's sad, but, you know, because because we're trying to put essentially like our mindset is that we're trying to put art on the body. Yeah. And this is more along the lines of like, I don't know, even borderline like mutilation where it's just like, you know, like I'm just going to cause a statement and put something horribly bad on. Yeah, yeah, like, you know, as a statement for sure. Well, yeah, statements. I mean, you got like these pop stars with scribbled desks scribble all over the faces. Yeah, like I want to look bad on purpose. Yeah, yeah. I mean, each to their own, I'm not here to judge if that's what you're into. That's what you're into. But like, I mean, I carved images into my desk, too. But it wasn't my face. Yeah. I want to know who is your favorite tattoo artist? Whoa. Yeah. Philip Lou. Philip Lou. Yeah. Philip Lou has been probably consistent. May could we get him on the show? I know, man. Getting him to come to the States would be that would be a challenge. I know that's why we got to get on the trip. We should put up. We would just fly to the Swiss Alps or French Alps. I'm sorry. We just put a montage of all the people mentioning his name. Like, look, man, look at him. Come here and talk to us. That would be a challenge without being credible. He's probably, you know, up there, like one of my favorite tattoo artists as well. Absolutely. Well, you know, he lives it. He breathes it, you know. He. There's a lot more to him than a lot. That's a cool tattoo. Yes. You know, he's dedicated and like no joke. Yes. You know, I've seen him lay out body suits in like eight hours, you know, and he's the fastest I've ever seen. And I'm fast, you know, but he blows me away. I mean, you know, people, I say fast, people are like, well, you shouldn't rush. Not rushing. No, it's fast. Just fast. It's effectively. And I think it's important that you're at least somewhat efficient with a tattoo because your customers sit in there suffering. Yeah. You know, and it's like it would be nice if it didn't take 14 hours to do a portrait that big, you know, but each to their own, you know, yeah, I don't rush at all. I'm not out to be the fastest. I just my style lends itself to speed. It's built that way. It's intended to be that way. There's textures I create that can only be done quickly. So that's like the secret to my speed is the efficiency and the techniques. Yes. Yeah. And as we come to a close, I want to ask you one question. What's one piece of advice that you would give your younger self and your tattoo career run away? What would you tell Paul Booth if you could go back in time at any point in time? Drop a little envelope, just leave a little note. Trust no one. Stay true to your art, man. Don't compromise it. You know, don't get caught up in the hype and all the bullshit around it. You know, if you become popular, that's great. Congratulations, but don't let it go to your head. There's nothing worse than an egomaniac, especially in tattooing. There's so many of them. Yes. You know, and I hate it more than I hate anything. Is these cocky pricks that think they're God's gift to tattooing, you know. And I think it's important for learning, if nothing else, to get better. You need to humble yourself. Yes. And just, you know, I think the best advice really for me is you stay true to your art and everything else will come. The popularity, the rock star bullshit, all that stuff will come if you're good. Yeah. And, and granted, there's a lot of good artists out there that nobody's ever heard of. But still, you be the best you can be with your art without compromising and staying true to it than all the other things that you're looking for. And you're driven as goals. Well, just naturally. Yes. Focus on the journey, not the reward. Absolutely. Yeah. That journey is probably the most the part that keeps you going, man, especially in tattooing. Yeah. It's a journey, man. Yeah. What's next in your journey after 30 years of tattooing? What's next in your journey? I got a screenplay for a horror film I'm looking to do. I just came out with a book. I've got my own coffee now, my own inks. Ink tubs. I'm explode. You know what it is? I the first time in a long time, all I have to think about is myself. Yeah. I don't have a bunch of artists to feed. Just me. Yeah. And I could just focus on things I want to do, like making some money outside of tattooing is always nice. Yes. You get old, you lose your hands in your eyes and you can't tattoo anymore. What do you got? You know, so I've spent years kind of gradually building up things outside of tattooing. That's really the bulk of it right now. I've always been an explorer. If I get a crazy idea, I get up in the middle of the night. I give it a logo and I start a proposal, you know, and turn it into something just my nature. So I have piles of these business ideas and concepts that some of them are million dollar ideas. But I'm an artist before I'm a businessman. So of course I can come up with the ideas, but facilitating them is a little more difficult for me. That's always the hardest part, just the execution of my good things. You know, it's hard to keep that balance. Like when I had the shop, business pushed in front of the art over demand and over the art had more demands to it that took my art away from me for a bit and because I had to focus on business. And that's why I walked away from doing conventions years ago, producing them. When I did tattoo the earth, I quit. I didn't have to quit, but I quit because I'm like, you know what? This, I see it already, these spreadsheets and politics. It's robbing me of my art. And I'm I'm an artist before I'm a businessman. So as much as I enjoyed putting on the conventions, it was a matter of survival, creative survival to walk away. Yeah, you know, I'm not afraid to walk away from shit. If it's not, you know, if it's detrimental in some way or it's not fun anymore, there's no point in doing it. You know, right. I love tattooing. I hate the industry, but I love tattooing. I'm tired of the politics and the boys club and all that shit. Well, be the one thing that you would change about the industry right now. I would make healed tattoos more important because it would get rid of a lot of the crap. You know, I'd like to see the public educated to what a good tattoo actually is. So we don't have to keep telling them you can't do a whole back piece in 23 and a half minutes. Well, I'm seeing more and more artists charging ridiculous amounts of money, which I personally have an ethical issue with. But I mean, I'm expensive, but I'm not ridiculous. You know, there's a difference. There's a ceiling to yeah, there's a difference between these guys are going over the ceiling. Yeah. You know, ten thousand dollars a day rate. What are you on drugs? That's insane. You know what I mean? It's wild. And it's all because of the height, not because of the talent. Right. And that's what pisses me off. Yeah, right. Because it ain't about talent. It's about, oh, you were on TV. You must be good. It's removing the craftsmanship from it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like I said, you know, it's an artisan's craft is where it comes from. To me, you know, I mean, yeah, it comes from carnivals and criminals, but still it's developed into a craft and and and. That's I don't think it's dying, but it's waning. Yeah. It's waning. I feel like we're in a crazy time of tattooing, but if more of us that love it, keep having these conversations. Yeah. Keep putting love into the art. Keep sharing the passion that we have for it. I think tattooing will find a good place and it will fall into good hands. Well, maybe some new, you know, some some new good hands. Yeah. Well, like the new education, it's all about education. Yeah. Maybe the new willingness to learn, of course. Yeah. And they might care about it just as much. Yeah, I agree. Hopefully. Yeah. I agree. Paul, we thank you so much for coming by. Oh, it's been a pleasure. Sharing your story, which is incredible. And working people find you nowadays, if you want to come get tattooed by you. PaulBoothArt.com. That's a spot, man. Any final thoughts, anybody? I'm going to thank Patreon supporters. This week, we're thanking Colin, Bussing and Penguin. Thank you guys for joining on the Patreon. If you want to be like those guys and help support the show, head over to Patreon.com slash honest tattooer and sign up to be a Patreon supporter. I guess the one thing I want to say is that I love tattooing. I've been tattooing for almost 18 years and being able to sit with people like Paul, we've been doing for 30 years is heavy and it means a lot to me. Because getting to hear their story helps me create a better story for myself. Absolutely. So I'm hoping that if you're a tattooer that you're either further down the line or in your sixth year, second year of tattooing, you come by, you listen to these stories because these are relevant things that will affect your career. And I feel like you're going to learn from some of our the good things and some of the mistakes we've made. You know, and I think that those things are very hard. Those stories are hard to get from people because sometimes you're just surrounded by a bunch of people that are all within your same kind of circle and all that. So we hope that you guys get a lot from it because I definitely do. And that's one of the reasons why I love doing the podcast and being here every week. So well, I fully support you guys, man. I like what you're doing. It is truly honest and that's what it's about. Appreciate that. Appreciate that. Thank you so much. I wouldn't have done this if otherwise, you know, I'm very hateful into it. As you should be. As anyone who knows me knows. All right, guys, well, thank you so much for joining us and thank you, Paul. Thank you. Thank you very much. We'll see you next week. Right. Take care. Cheers.
