 Welcome back to the honest art podcast today. So I want you to know that I have been deliberating on whether to do this podcast for for quite a while, like about a year. And finally, I decided that it was time to talk about it. And if you look at the title of the podcast, you can see that it's probably something that we're going to weed a lot of men out because of the title on podcast. If you're a man and you're still listening to this, I just want to like bow and I appreciate you doing so. If you have a partner though that is a woman and she's a creative, you might want to stick around and listen to this because I do think it's really, really important. So what we're going to be talking about obviously is the menopause, right? And in particular, my menopausal journey and what happened if anything, you'll know what it was, but what happened to my creative practice as I started going through this huge change in my life because I'll admit that it hasn't been fun, that the process has not been great. Do not recommend. But on the other side, it has caused some really great things to happen for me, my creative process and for my art. So let me share all of the deeds with you. Are you ready? Let's get messy. First of all, I want to be really honest. And I know this is embarrassing to admit, but I want to tell you, I truly did not think that the menopause train was going to stop at my house. I mean, now I know that it literally affects 100% of women if we have the pleasure, the honor of living long enough for it to happen. But I really didn't think it was going to happen to me, like full stop. That happens to other women, not so much to me. But here's why. I was raised by three generations of women before me. So not only was there my mother, but there was my grandmother and my great grandmother. And like when I say my great grandmother, I'm not talking like I knew her and she was in a nursing home. This woman made me gumbo almost every day. I woke up in the morning as she was there. So when I say three generations of women, I really mean three generations of women. That's how much either any, any of them talked about menopause, like any of them, not one. There was not one talk of a hot flash. There was not one talk of brain fog. There was not one talk of dry anything. Nothing. None of them talked about it, never heard a word. So of course I thought, oh, well, I come from that special family where we were just not affected by menopause. And then all of a sudden, not all of a sudden, it actually started happening in my four days. I started having hot flashes, right? And I just thought, well, you know, that's a hot flash. I didn't really, I didn't really attach it to anything big like menopause. Right? It was just hot flashes, right? But then the last couple of years, I started having all of these other symptoms like I could not concentrate. Like I already have ADD. And so I just thought, oh my God, my ADD is so bad. I literally cannot concentrate. And it was even to the point when I have a fantastic, amazing team of women around me. And I mean, they are like top of the line, top of their field. They're incredible. But when we'd be having our team calls and I didn't want them to realize, I didn't want them to know that I was having such a hard time remembering what they were saying and like the brain fog was that bad. It was crazy. And on top of that, I was kind of crying on and off throughout the day. Now I don't mind being emotional. I, I embraced, you know, if I think something is really moving, I'm going to cry about it. I'm going to just let all of that flow. But y'all, it's like, I remember one time I was talking to, I was writing a book, actually the book was finished and I was trying to decide whether I was going to go with publishers or not. And I had a friend who wanted me to meet with somebody who was in the publishing world. And so I started talking about the book and I started crying as I was, and I just thought, what is wrong with me? Like throughout the day, I would just randomly start crying and things that wouldn't normally get to me that much. So I had brain fog. I had hot flashes. I was intermittently crying on and off throughout the day, which tells me that my brain chemistry was off, right? It was different. So it meant that I was really, when you get down to it, I was cycling through periods of anxiety and depression. And there, look at this up. There have been so many studies that show that the highest rate of diagnosed depression by psychologists and doctors is they, and the highest number of prescriptions written are women in their fifties and menopause. It's not that we are depressed. We're not clinically depressed. We're fucking in menopause people. And I didn't know that, right? But none of that, none of the fact that my eyes, when I would wake up in the morning, they would kind of stick together, you know, like so my, all of the things in my body that needed moisture were drying up, all of that. None of that really did the trick for me to finally go to my doctor and say, oh my God, something is wrong. It was, it was the fact that I wasn't sleeping. And it, like I had not had a great night's sleep and I cannot tell you how long. So all of these things started happening to me. And you guys know, like we're not robots, right? We are women and we are feelers. And the fact that I was, had so much brain fog, I wasn't sleeping. I was starting to fall asleep on the regular. If I just sat still long enough, I would fall asleep at two in the afternoon, three in the afternoon. And like, like the kind of exhaustion that I can't drag my ass off the sofa. And I'm not a napper. That's just not normally who I, who I am. Okay. So let me just throw one more, because if that wasn't enough, if not sleeping wasn't enough and crying all the damn time and like just not being able to create cause I'm asleep on the sofa, if all that wasn't enough, all the things drying up on my body, if that wasn't enough, my fucking hair started falling out. All right. So nothing says, I don't feel sexy anymore. Like your hair falling out. Right. So all of these things started happening, which led me to finally going to my gynecologist and saying, I need support. I need help. Now I'm telling you guys this now because I'm going to tell you what I did, but I'm not a doctor. You do you. I know there's a lot of different ideas out there. There's a lot of really, really helpful things. You just have to decide what's right for you. I'm going to tell you what I did, but don't you DM me. Don't, don't email me. Don't come for me in any, I'm not telling you what I'm doing is right for you. For me, what was right for me was hormone replacement therapy. I don't have a lot of the risk factors and everything, but anyway, hormone replacement therapy. You guys within two nights of taking progesterone, your girl was sleeping. I hadn't slept through the night in maybe a decade. It had been years since I had slept through the night. So I got on HRT progesterone, finally got on estrogen and there go the hot flashes sleeping through the night. No hot flashes, but it wasn't just that that I did. I also, I also went on these supplements that absolutely changed my life. And if you are part of my Patreon community, if you're a patron from Patreon, I'm going to share on there what all of the supplements that I'm doing because I feel like I'm 35 again. And my, when friends see me, they're like, that haven't seen me in like a year. They're like, what are you doing? You look so young. You know, what's your secret? All of that. And on Patreon, I'm sharing all of those things. But so we head over to that. But all I'm really want you to get from this is like, I first, I didn't know this, this was coming. Second, I was in the middle of it so deeply that I didn't even know what it was. I couldn't crawl out of it. And then finally I was like, I can't take this anymore. And I reached out for help to my gynecologist. And there are so many resources out there. Again, I'll list some more of these in Patreon. But anyway, that, that part sucked. But I will tell you there were in terms of my art, there were some benefits actually of menopause that you couldn't have told me ahead of time. I think it's really impacted my work. So the first thing now that I know, you know, now that I feel good again, this is important, the first thing that I will say now that I feel good again is that I have run out of fucks to give. And that really changes and affects your art. When you don't care who sees it, you don't care what they're going to say, you know, it's like creativity for the sake of fun and play and enjoying yourself. That is what this time in my life and this menopausal journey has given me. You just, you just don't, you don't, you run out of fucks and it's beautiful. And as a result of that and seeing the response to my work and what I'm doing to the response to like just what I'm saying on social media, what I'm saying to my, you know, if you're part of Patreon or my email list, right? What I'm saying because the response has been good, now I'm learning to trust myself more. So imagine what trusting myself has done for my art. It means that I, I self edit a lot less. I can't say I'm completely free of it. But when I start to kind of second guess myself and my judgment, I'll be like, no, hold up, hold up and I'll just trust myself to continue to move forward. That is huge when it comes to our creativity. And then additionally, it has made me just more curious, you know, it's made me less apprehensive to explore a different area. Maybe it's exploring a new tool, exploring a new modality. Maybe it's ordering those, those new supplies from Amazon. Like I'm just leaning into my curiosity and exploring that in a way that honestly I can't say I have done in other times in my creative career. And the only way I can, the only thing I can really, you know, attach that to is just like I am just in that phase of my life and it's, it's completely freeing. It's beautiful. So because of that, you know, it's, it's like a self exploration for myself, a self exploration of like, what do, what do I want to put on the campus? And that part of that, you know, if giving fewer Fox, the self exploration, the, the beautiful freedom of putting whatever I want on the canvas without fear of judgment from other people, that has just made me so much more confident as an artist. So while the majority of the experience kind of sucked, right? I mean, I didn't even go into how my joints ached. So while the majority of that sucked when I was in the middle of it, the, the fact that I, I didn't just sit back and go, Oh, well, that's just my lot in life. Oh, well, guess it's just, just going to die slowly now. Right. And the fact that I didn't do that, I was like, no, hold up, hold up. Just because I didn't have three generations ahead of me talking about this doesn't mean that I have to just accept this as my new reality. I'm just not that kind of person. So I'm really glad that I acknowledged this time in my life. I'm really glad that I explored what options were available to me, but I also am so excited and I'm so happy that I have gone through this because it really has impacted my art and it really has impacted who I believe and know I am as an artist. So this is coming for all of us ladies. Maybe you're already past it. Maybe it's going to be coming for you. Maybe you're right in the middle of it. No, I'm right here with you.
