 Hello, I'm Zen master Sebastian Rizan. Today I'm going to be being interviewed by Nadia, one of the Zen Art Center community members, and she's just going to be asking me whatever is on her mind around the topic of Zen. So yeah, if you have any questions for future Q&As, drop them in the comments and we'll try to include them in future interviews. So with that said, do you have any questions? So there is a story that I read in a children book about two monks, traveling monks, the older monk and then the young monk, and the older monk is that there is a lady and then he's carrying her for a little bit and then she doesn't say thank you and she's ungrateful basically and then a few hours later the younger monk, I think I'm butchering the story but I'm making no point, the younger monk, so a few hours later the younger monks tells the older monk, oh you know that lady didn't even say thank you and the older monk says well I dropped her off hours ago and you're still carrying her in your mind. So I butchered the story but you know you get the point. The point is very often you can carry with you thoughts and emotions and memories and a lot of the stuff for a long, long time and I guess the more you carry things with you for a longer time the harder it is to clear your mind even with meditation. So I guess the question is how can you build that kind of non-attachment to things and people and stuff that happen throughout the day so that that meditation or whenever we have time to meditate that meditation is actually taken care of the real stuff. Yeah, it's interesting you told that story and you know there's the initial burden of the monk carrying the woman and then the younger monk kept carrying the woman in his mind and he kept carrying this burden and it was like an unnecessary burden he could just put it down at any time he was choosing to carry it to some degree. I realize that's probably a little bit out of this control but the idea is why carry things you don't need to carry you only have a certain capacity for what you can carry you need to learn how to put things down and then you can pick up new things and have fresh experiences and new experiences so you just have to get good at putting things down and the same way you get good at lifting them up you practice you know if you want to lift heavier things you practice lifting heavy things if you want to get good at putting things down you practice putting them down what do I mean by that you practice meditation you practice focusing on what you're doing and those are ways that will force you if you're completely focused on each moment by definition you're not thinking about other things so practicing that level of focus is how you get good at putting those things down. So now how would you or what can you say about just the way one breath throughout the day and how that is I guess also helpful in not carrying things with you or managing your emotions or calming your nervous system etc throughout the day so just the focus on the breathing and maybe even conscious breathing and knowing when your breathing is out of what's normal. Yeah I honestly I don't personally use a lot of breath work I think there's ways you can I think these these kind of things can be circular so if your mind is clear your breath will become normal if you learn to control your breath though you can learn to clear your mind too and to settle your your body down so that it's not interjecting itself into your mind. So I do use a breathing technique in my meditation class before I start that's something you can do at any point throughout the day you can also just as a form of meditation just count your breaths that's just another form of a mantra so like I was saying your your mantra can be anything so I when I teach these things I teach in in the most this stuff is very difficult to do first of all it's easy to say but I because of that I try to keep it very simple so I explain things in terms of a mantra that's all you need a mantra can be a word it can be your actions or it could be your breath and if you breathe slower and deeper it can calm your body down so if you're counting your breaths and you try to slow that countdown that will help calm your body but I I learned to control my breath through my martial arts practice but it was never really the focus of my training it's just something I learned how to control my body through that practice and I think you can learn through any mantra practice to do these same things so you can you can have different techniques but to me there are different approaches to the same thing so then I guess I want to talk a little bit about martial arts because again the image I have in my head of monks and charlene monks and is like heavy heavy kung fu or or any type of martial arts in Japan and in all of these countries where the martial art goes hand in hand with spiritual practices and same for Taoism through you know chikung and tai chi and there's always like a body-mind connection or like working in those like tradition working through the body to get to the mind so how do you see martial arts in general how do you see it working or helping one in their spiritual journey well I I can't remember but I believe kung fu literally translates to something that has nothing to do with martial arts it's like mastering a skill essentially tai chi and qi qi gong chi is is life energy is life energy universal energy so all of these practices especially when they're they're rooted uh in a spiritual practices are ways of learning to control the universal energy that's running through your body and the form of martial arts I learned was uh it was the same it was a it was a way of manipulating the universal energy in your body my teacher was a zen master and a martial arts master and his martial arts was a form of moving meditation that's what he taught it as uh but I think any martial art can be that if you use it in that way consciously learning to control your energy if you're just using it to beat people up I think you're going to destroy any of the good karma that you're creating through the practice and so part of the the Buddhist spiritual journey is trying to alleviate suffering in the world so if you're beating people up you're adding suffering to the world and so you uh that's not generally something any buddhist will condone so in that way uh I just wanted to differentiate you know there's there's stuff we call martial arts which is like in America which is like sport fighting that's not really the same thing is what I'm referring to I see it's it's more about um using an art form in this case martial arts is the art of war it's these techniques you use in war I learned how to use a sword I learned how to use my hands in combat but I learned them not to dominate someone else but to master myself and through mastering myself I learned to control myself to control my body using my mind to control my body it's no different than using your breath to control your body it's just different ways you're activating your mind to control your body and when you can do that that's the proper order of things your mind should control your body not your body controls your mind and establishing that order I think is an important step to being able to control your mind and that's why one of the things I suggest to anyone who is a a serious student of mine is that they they find an art to master that is a part of the process and um in zen to be a zen master you have to prove that you're a master of the techniques of zen and so that's just a different art form that you're learning to master so martial arts is mastery of the body or the mind mastering the body but also or along the same line a way of being or working out or I guess working on being in a meditative state while doing the martial arts because that's what it requires to be a good martial artist especially as you move along and progress in there but also martial arts as a way which you did not talk about after but as a way to work with universal energies so I guess can you expand a little bit more on that part specifically of martial arts of how martial arts help with that well you're learning to control the energy of your body I don't have like um any mystical definition of universal energy it's the energy in the universe it's the same stuff physics studies when you eat food you put the food in your body that gives you energy that's a form of universal energy you're putting through into your body then what do you do with that energy how do you use it do you use it to fight with somebody or do you use it to help somebody those are two different ways you can use the same energy the energy is neutral but you can learn how to direct it in a way that it helps you accomplish your goals and um you know just like just to uh complete that thought uh about martial arts and mastery if you are using um if you are using this energy to become a master it can build a lot of confidence in yourself and one of the um one of the side effects is that is it it creates a stronger self image and that is another form of karma that you have to learn how to put down in the process of becoming a master so as you become a lot of people become masters we have lots of masters you know across the world if you if you have a master in a science or an art you're a master you're but you're you're not a zen master and you're not enlightened and the reason a lot of masters don't continue to progress is because they develop a certain amount of ego that stops them from wanting to progress because they become very comfortable with their level of knowledge and they learn how to control their their body and the the immediate surroundings around them but they stop seeking the deeper truths which transcend the ego which transcend conceptual thinking which transcends intellectual thinking so and i want to talk about the ego but before going there um so or maybe we should just talk about it right now i guess um so when you say ego first what do you mean by ego when i say ego um i literally just mean your sense of self like your self and self identity not like as an aware conscious being thinking about myself as an individual the most simplistic definition i can give and the most all-encompassing is ego is self it's the it's the idea that you and the line you draw around your body is separate from other things so on a scientific level i mean we've we've created uh lines that say this is where i i stop and and something else begins but those lines don't really exist they are you know like your skin is composed of cells cells are made of atoms atoms are made of particles and particles don't really exist they're part of waves so there is no real line there it's all there's nothing solid there if you uh if you take your your heart out of your body you you pass away your body dies but if you take if you take away the the planet from your body your body also dies so they're interconnected in a way where um we've just kind of uh we've made a conceptual boundary there and my whole point is that you have to see what's actually there when you drop all of those conceptual boundaries now those exist exist for a reason it's something we've evolved to recognize so that we can survive as uh living beings but but so there is a purpose to that however it also is masking the real truth which is that those boundaries are a lot more fuzzy than we make them out to be and they really when you strip away everything and you keep looking deeper and deeper and deeper there's nothing there that's the emptiness and when you it's easy for you to sit and understand what i'm saying but what i'm suggesting is if you practice zen enough you experience that and it changes the way you experience everything once you've experienced that so i think there's a saying that says like dropping knowledge to gain wisdom um and that's like the i guess the process from intellect to a different to wisdom being as like a different type of knowing which is not truly intellect yeah and i'll i'll i'll use just uh an analogy it's intellectual understanding is like having a map it's like having a map of i'll just say well it's like having a map of germany okay i have i've seen a map of germany does that mean i've been to germany does that mean i've experienced it no because i haven't well i actually technically have but only a small part of it but the point point is having the map and going there and experiencing it is a totally different thing so it's hard right so it's hard to drop knowledge because because it gives you relief to know to like say you know what one plus one equals two that at least i'm sure of yeah so i mean i but i can have a map of germany and i can look on google and find all of these things out about germany and i can know a lot about germany but it's totally different than going there and experiencing it and every individual's experience of it is going to be a unique experience so the ego wants safety and security and for that purpose creates and keeps boundaries so it can survive right and then that leap of faith requires a little madness or you know at least being like you know what i don't know what's out there i don't know what i'm looking for but i'm still gonna do that kind of leap of faith and how do you like it really needs some kind of madness or it needs so much suffering that the actual life that you take the unknown to you know what you know already because what you know is like so not safe anyway yeah well i think a lot of that is just social programming we've had to fear certain things stuff we've learned to value certain things about ourselves from the day from the day you're born people are telling you that you're nadia and you're separate from the rest of the world so you've been conditioned to believe that since the day you were born um i don't think that those i don't think it necessarily requires um madness but i think i can understand that there's fear uh the suffering you know i would say that's the suffering is unavoidable as long as you cling to these ideas you will you will suffer you'll continue to suffer and if that suffering becomes madness because you're afraid to let go then that's what you will get but that's another form of extreme attachment and that's what i'm suggesting that you let go of and so on the other side is this is what the the buddha and the dharma we're teaching is that on the other side there there is no suffering um once you are completely detached from those ideas and you've let them go suffering in itself is an idea suffering is suffering itself is an idea but suffering is like is not just an idea something you experienced it's more than just something out there in your brain isn't it uh i mean i would say it's it's it's a created concept i mean i think like pain is real but continuing suffering from that is i see is a different form of attachment when you recognize this deeper truth attached to the mind that is associated with the mind you'll understand it's it's not necessary to suffer in the way this that you are so pain and suffering different pain exist physical body related yep uh suffering mental and it's like carrying that load with you and the more you carry the load the more you suffer yeah and i i think they're obviously related in some way suffering can feel like pain pain though i wouldn't necessarily uh say it's correlated with physical experiences but it's also mental you can learn to block out pain you can use uh different pharmaceutical drugs so you don't feel pain during surgery for instance so there's things that you can do that prevent that form of suffering all right well thank you
