 Bogdano itนะคะIA Hello, everyone. Welcome to St. Art, the show where we talk about all things Catholic, our Lady of Guadalupe, Mary and Apparitions, the lives of saints, art, and everything that's happening in the current world that pertains to those subjects. Today I have such a wonderful guest. For real, she is, it is such an honor to have my guest today. And I will let her speak most of the show about what she does. I met her, I will only say how I met her. I went with a friend, we have a ministry that we studied. We actually go and pray to clinics where children are aborted. And we take our rosaries and I had a rosary thinking that I was in front of an abortion clinic and someone comes from the back and yells something at me. Of course, the first thing I thought is someone is coming to attack me or someone is going to say something that's not very nice. And no, she was coming to say, welcome, what are you doing? You're praying the rosary. Thank you so much for coming. Why are you praying the rosary? And we said, well, this is an abortion clinic. And she said, no, this is a center for pregnancy help. So we help women that are pregnant and that are in an emergency situation, are lost, need guidance, and we take them in and we help them out in such various forms and ways that I was very surprised. I went into the clinic, they showed me around, they did a thorough explanation of everything they do. And without further ado, I will introduce you to Marta, my guest. Thank you. Thank you so much for having me here. It is truly an honor to be amongst women and people that are watching that respect and love life. And we are all defenders of life, right? And this is what we're doing at Heartbeat of Miami Pregnancy Health Medical Clinics. We are here to equip women, empower them so that they can make an informed decision and give them the two beautiful choices, which is helping them have their baby or a plan of adoption. We have all been adopted into God's family. Adoption is a beautiful option. But unless women have true choices, where is that right to choose? When the only choice that most women have with an unplanned pregnancy is to end the life of the baby, to abort that child. And that is what Heartbeat of Miami is about, helping these women to choose life for their pre-born baby. There's something that you said everyone defends life. It is true. Everyone defends their own life, their loved ones' lives. So when we say respect life or honor life, it's not for a particular religion or faith. No, it's everyone. Everyone wants to defend life. But it's like there's some sort of stigma in society that when a pregnancy is unplanned, then somehow we have to finish it in some form. And here you are to say, no, we don't. There are other options. And here we are in this show to speak about, hey, no, you can have a child even if it is unplanned. Correct. Abortion is unthinkable. Unthinkable because women were not created. We were not created to kill our child. And I understand that things happen. And there's forgiveness because we have a forgiving God when we confess and we ask Him to forgive us. He does forgive. But the bottom line is that there are many women out there that don't know and have not yet done that. And yet they don't have a way out. They think they don't have a way out when there are places such as Heartbeat of Miami that are there to help them and to equip them and to empower them and to walk with them. Because the majority of women that have abortions is because they think there is no other choice. There's no one to help. Right. They think that they have no support. They think that abortion is the only option. And what happens for those women? How do they find help? What should they do? Can you recommend the practical way of reaching out for help? Do they Google? What is it that they do? Because I found you by chance. How does someone that... I'm glad because that means that God is bringing women thinking it is an abortion place. And obviously when they come in, they find life. They find God. They find women that are there willing to walk with them. And to them it's like, why is this free? And we tell them because people that care for you without even knowing you, they love God so much that that is why it's free. They help us. They support this mission so that we can save your child and save you from the pain of a forever pain. And I can second that. I can speak from my personal experience. I was saying, not only how is this free and you're going to tell us more about that because we have a very general soul with us today. And just why is everyone so nice? Why? How can you be so nice? You don't know me. So this is... And that tells you that is a love of God. That is truth with a capital letter. That is the truth. You just feel it. You feel that you're with people that are really, really there trying to help you and not trying to sell anything. They don't belong to... They don't have an agenda. No agenda. No, he didn't. That's how what I felt when I went in. So Martha didn't tell me that. I didn't read this in a book. I'm not theorizing. That's how I felt. So I encourage everyone that knows, you know, there has a family member, a friend, encourage them to find these clinics because this show is nationwide and they see us in all of the United States. And your clinics are in South Florida, correct? Actually, heartbeat of Miami, pregnancy, health medical clinics, we cover all of South Florida. But there are pregnancy centers and clinics all over the United States that are there willing to help these moms, you know, that think that there is no other way out. And a woman with an unplanned pregnancy will never need an abortion. A woman with an unplanned pregnancy needs that support, that, yes, I'm with you, you know, and to us, we see it every day. In 18 years almost that I've had this organization, I'm the founder, co-founder actually, and president of this organization. Since we started from the very beginning, we have seen how so many women have just chosen life for their child and over 68,000 babies have been rescued from abortion because, right, at heartbeat of Miami. And that's just one organization. And when we always say, please, if this is too much, you know, we're here for you, we walk with them for an entire year. When an entire year, if they need us, we're there for them. And we always tell them whatever it is, there's a plan of adoption, you can always come back, you can, we're here for you. None of them have ever come to return the baby. None of them, however, those that have aborted because there is a percentage, over 92% of chosen life, but there is a percentage that has aborted. And you know, so Rania, they come back, they come back with a broken heart. And that's how we refer them so that they can receive that healing of post-aborted. So you provide that help too. Exactly. Post-abortion. There's just so much to unpack here because the, it's like the narrative in society is, oh, respect life, and then like pro-choice and respect life. There's so much more. Why don't we talk about prevention, for example? Why don't we talk about how women suffer after having an abortion? Physically, some can't get pregnant again. Mentally, emotionally. Many families are damaged. Boyfriends, husbands, exactly. Grandparents, there's just, there's so much more to the right to choose. It's not as simple as we, as society makes it seem. Oh, I'm pregnant. I have the right to choose. So I will terminate my pregnancies. No. And then something that I'd like to just throw out there and maybe see if you have any thoughts on it is we are living in a time of a lot of awareness for wellness and mental health. Last week was mental health awareness day. And this month, we're in the month of respect life and honoring life in all its forms. So we're not only speaking of the unborn child, we're also speaking of like older people and people who are ill, right? I always say from the womb to the tomb. Exactly. From the womb to the tomb. We are no one to take anybody's life. And so we're within that month. But in this wellness journey that many people, many women are on, and many women and men, where does the hurt, the damage that abortion causes us in, again, mentally, emotionally, and physically, where does fit in, where does that fit in in this wellness journey? It's as if, oh, I'm eating only organic. I'm just diving right into like a very, you know, a very difficult topic. But here I am doing all these things, the special diet, the special nutrition, buying organic food. And but then I continue taking these, for example, these, these chemicals or these harsh procedures and surgeries, because it's that that can hurt me permanently. But that's a taboo. And that's not talked about. It's not talked about. It's not talked about in the churches. It's not talked about in women's groups. It's not talked about in youth groups. It's not really talked about freely. Yet we freely say all other things. I mean, it is so easy to say, you know, I used to be in drugs, but now I found God and I'm no longer in drugs. Oh, are you still still? But, but how often do you see a woman stand up and say, I know what you will suffer if you have an abortion? It's almost like the woman with the issue of blood in the Bible. How, you know, she was dead. She had gone, seen old doctors. She had gone through so much for 12 years. She was suffering, you know, from a blood issue. We don't know what that blood issue could have been an abortion for all we know. I'm just saying, right? Yet she touched the garment. Jesus's garment. And immediately she was healed. Women that find themselves with the pain and believe me when I tell you, no matter how many women you say, I celebrate my abortion, we know that that cannot be true. You cannot celebrate the death of that baby that at whatever period of time you carried in your womb and you will always have that blood of that baby in your body. So it's impossible to really say, but this is what the world tells them. And so they come, become so, oh, I celebrate my abortion. It is not true. Those women are hurting and we have to see them as such. They're hurting. They come from a place of hurt. They come from a place of hurt. And, and so they, they suffer through an abortion and they will, I already did it. I'll do it again. Then they advise other women, oh, that's nothing when inside, they're the walking dead because it cannot be possible that a woman can celebrate the death of their child. And I know because I've seen them. And when they come back, those that have aborted, you know, what an honor to be able to point them, you know, to God again and to, and to tell them, you know, there's forgiveness for you, you know, let's find a place you can confess that you can get that healing that you need. And we see that. We see how they are transformed completely by the grace of our Lord, the grace and mercy. And mercy is not about pointing to the divine mercy. It's about take care, you know, take care of yourself, make the right decisions and education. Before the show, Martin, I were briefly speaking about the importance of education and any mothers and fathers, anyone out there listening to us. I hope that there's one thing that you get from today, aside from being in the presence and looking at this wonderful, generous human being that is Martha, our guest today. It's educate yourselves. What go deeper, go to heartbeatofmiami.org. Go to their website, go to their Instagram account. And you will see real life testimonies and situations that happen every day in those clinics and how just happy people are. Is it hard? Is it easy? No, it may not be easy. Is it hard? Well, it's less hard with such caring people that provide so much tangible help. They provide you with diapers. They refer you to doctors. They help you in every step of the process. And I get goosebumps just remembering the things they refer you to doctors. They even sometimes call them and so that you, their office, so that they expect you. They walk with you every step of the way. And this is real. This is not fake. This is real. This is truth. This is life. You've said it pretty much. This is love. This is God's love and action. These are the eyes of the Lord. These are the mouth of the Lord, the hands of the Lord, the feet of the Lord. This is the heart of God because that's the least of these. That tiny baby and the shedding of innocent blood is horrifying. Right. We shouldn't, it's almost as if we shouldn't even be really having to do this. We, you know, those women, they, it would be ideal to have a village, right? A family support and to not have to think of this as a first choice. Again, this is not about blaming anyone. No. Some people out of ignorance, out of not knowing, out of here. Out of fear. Out of fear. But there are other options and there are people that help. And I know that sometimes it seems that there's no one to help us, but we're here to say there are people that help us and please look it up. We have, it's just typing on, googling away. Harp it of Miami. Harp it of Miami and they can, if you're watching from another state that's not Florida. Call us and we'll speak for you. We have a, we have a, a directory that all over the world. Actually, there are people that are helping women so that they can have their baby. And that's what we're about. And you know, when you said about education, education starts at home. Education is when the parents come and walk with these children and, and tell them what's good or bad. You know, oftentimes I say, oh, it's just that the abortion issue, it's a religious issue. And I'm going to ask a question to those that are watching us today. Is it really a religious issue or is it a moral issue? Is it moral to kill another human being? No, it's not. I mean, if we wouldn't allow it in animals, right? We don't allow it in animals. We don't allow it in, as a human, you cannot kill another human being. Right. But they, but then there's the argument of the clump of cells. Is it human? Is it not? Right. Right. And scientists know that, that it's life. Of course, science has proven it is human. But it's like, they can't, it's like we're, we're, I'm being kind of perhaps extreme or some people may not like to hear it. It's as if we're caught in this, in this narrative that society kind of imposes on us. And then we don't, we're, this is a calling to think beyond that. So Jesus was a rebel in a way. And he, he invited us to always seek the truth. And that's the invitation to seek the truth. Is it, is it okay to say that an animal that is expecting their offspring is expecting whatever puppies, for example, in the case of a dog, but a woman, a woman that who's pregnant is expecting a clump of cells. Why are we so okay with the animal world, perhaps, but not the human? So these are the kind of deep questions that are not really that deep, that are basic and that we have to ask ourselves. And in Africa, I heard that the word abortion doesn't exist, for example, there's no translation for the word abortion, because it's so unfathomable, so unthinkable, that there's just no word to say it. Why would a mother seek to, of course, there are, you know, certain situations, but not as a society as a whole. And I think that, I think that also we have to think about in this education that we're speaking of, we have to think about prevention. What do you think about prevention? That's a, that's a very good question. And, and right now I'm speaking not only to young ladies, but to women in childbearing years. Okay. Prevention. Is there anything that can prevent? Are there any condoms for the heart? There are no condoms for the heart. First and foremost, I'm, to these women that are talking about prevention, you know, when God says to wait for marriage, he knew what he was saying, because the majority of the men that their girlfriends or whatever have a non-planned pregnancy, they're wanting to run away. I mean, that's the bottom line. And, and so prevention is education. Like when you look at this young man that you're so in love with and crazy about, do you think that that's the one that you want to father your child? Because the bottom line is that that's the bottom line. One and one is two. And then a man and a woman get together and they have an intimacy and I'm sorry, but not whatever birth control you want to pull out of your hat. It's not a hundred percent effective. But first and foremost, the heart, what's going to happen to your heart? It gets trampled on. It gets, and then it becomes easier for another partner and another partner and another partner. And that is when we have to come to the truth of saying, is this what God wants for me? Did God create me for this? That's when we have to choose. That's when we have to choose. That's when we have to choose. Did God create me for this relationship? Is this the man that's going to take me to the altar to be his wife and the mother of his children? This is what we need to think about because, you know, how many times in a night of, you know, whatever, women get pregnant, even if it's just the first time. So basically what I'm trying to say is that prevention, I don't know. I think that the only prevention is wait for, you know, for God to show you the man that's going to be your husband, the woman that is going to be your wife. That's prevention, you know, and his word is not light, you know, and I know that people say, well, everyone is doing it. Well, I've got news for you. Not everyone is doing it. There are women that are saving themselves and there are men that are waiting for that woman, you know, that God has for them. I know it's kind of strange for an older woman to talk like that, but let me tell you, if I were to do it all over again, even during these times, I would do it exactly like that because I know that I know that I know that God's plans are always perfect. And there's an order of things, right? And it's just being logical and strategic even. Strategic. Again, it's not religion. It's just being strategic. I can get pregnant. Would I be okay undergoing surgery and hurting myself, hurting someone else, a baby, and whatever community or having it? Would I be okay? Yes, no. Okay, then this is how I am going to act. It's like one thing leads to the next. It's really not rocket science, but in today's world, one feels like we're stepping on eggs kind of and we have to be so politically correct, but really it's just common sense. But you know, we have to speak truth. We have to speak the truth and it's common sense. Because if it's, you know, the law of cease or the law of God, you know, as for me and my house, we're going to serve God, you know, and speaking truth, right? You know, we're not condemning anyone. We're just speaking truth. Exactly. Just speak the truth. Educate yourself. Educate. Whatever happens, we'll deal with it, but let's just speak with truth. Exactly. And tell us about the Gala. You've had a Gala recently. I was so, so fortunate to have been able to go to attend. And I will also share this with our audience. I was so surprised. I couldn't believe I was among hundreds of people that were there, again, in a society that you kind of feel against the grain or you kind of feel like you have to stay quiet. And these, there were politicians. There were mis, future mis universes there. There were just common people like myself. There were all sorts of people giving face and showing up for something that is so politically incorrect. So can you tell us about your Gala? Yes. Well, our Gala is our big fund raiser. And as, as you all know, as a nonprofit, you know, it's very difficult to raise funds, especially for a cause that is not very popular, right? Because people think that, oh, well, that's her problem. Or, oh, well, you know, I'm pro-choice or whatever the case may be, it's very difficult to raise funds for such an organization. However, because God was the one that opened these doors. We started in 2007. And when we opened our first clinic, and now we have five clinics, five. You know, we survived the economic meltdown of 2008, 2009. We survived COVID by his grace and mercy. I always say his divine mercy has brought us to this point. And opening the last clinic in, well, not the last, because we only got knows how many he's going to open in the future. But opening the homestead location, it was such a challenge, because it had been in our hearts for so long. And then all of these happened, you know, we had four clinics at that time. And then the homestead location, I knew about the sexual traffic. I knew about the, you know, the situation with immigrants that was happening there, you know, women that were being coerced into having an abortion because they thought that there was no other choice, that there was no help, that they were going to not have any doctors because they had no papers or whatever the case may be. And to be able to be there now and be a part of a community that is being helped finally. And we're teaching these women how valuable their heart is and how valuable they are, you know, and to us. And that's what we do at all of our clinics. But there was such a deep need in this party, in all the ones we have, but this location, there was nothing from the Kendall location to the homestead location. It was a big drive, and there was nothing there. So that helps us serve the keys as well. So now we're from the keys to Broward pretty much, you know, helping women in all the South Florida. Sure. Sure. We have the one in Hialeah. That was the first one that used to be an abortion business, by the way, in the early 80s. Then we had the North, we have the North Miami Clinic, which serves a beautiful community. Then we have the Kendall location, which is right next to a college. All of them are very close to high schools and colleges. As you know, the abortionist open near high schools and colleges. Then we have, we opened the one in Little Havana that was an abortion business for over 28 years. And they close the abortions. That's the one you went to. And they closed and we opened. And now these two clinics that were a previous abortion business are life-saving clinics. Clinics that are transforming the lives of women and saving the lives of babies. Then the one in Homestead, which opened a year and a half ago. And I get this joy in my heart. The joy of the Lord in my heart, because to know that this can only be by His grace and His divine mercy. Because this is supernatural that we have been able to do this during these difficult times. So our fundraiser is that big event, which is the Gala. And as you saw, it was a very beautiful taste. It was very, with humble means, if you will. And the people that sponsored it so that we could have it. But you saw how beautiful, the beautiful venue. It was all so precious. But you know, what makes for us a successful Gala was God glorified in that process. So you're saying the Gala was gifted in a way to the heartbeat of man? It's not that it's gifted by people, by us selling the dinners, you know, people sponsoring. You know, it's not cheap or inexpensive to have a high quality Gala like God deserves, right? He deserves the best. So when we bring these women, you saw there were like three women that were previous patients of heartbeat of Miami that were there with their babies. One of them was sitting at my table. It was a Miss Cuba. The audience, no Cuba, hasn't had a Miss Universe in about 50 something years. And now it's happening. And one of the Miss Cubas went to the clinic. Do you want to tell us about that? Absolutely. Her testimony is public. And she was planning on having an abortion. She came to have an abortion. And it was so beautiful because in one of our Gala's, she and her and her husband testified and we were able to help her see the beautiful life that she was carrying. And you met that baby. Gorgeous. Yes, I had him in my lap and she went and what was amazing is that it's like love has a expansive power, right? It's contagious. So she was, she went to heartbeat of Miami. Lovingly, they explained what her options were, how they were going to help her. And so she ended up having her baby and it's her life. It is her life and her husband's life. Oh my gosh. He adores that baby. It's a beautiful family. She adores the baby. She brought the baby to the Gala, very well behaved. And she brought all of the other her friends, her co-Miss Cuba's that are candidates to be Miss Universe. And how transformative is that? Because it's a form of education because now all of those girls, all of those women that attend, you know, many of these events that usually pro-life or respect life is not spoken of. And somehow they're ambassadors to the happiness that life and the families bring. And that's what this young lady did. She, in other words, she told them about her story. They chose heartbeat of Miami to help heartbeat of Miami. And it was so amazing the way that these girls said, I had no idea. I thought that maybe like an unplanned pregnancy, you know, would just break my life forever and meeting her and meeting that baby. We understand now and knowing what you do. I think that education is all like you said. And we would like to touch on the topic of, you know, something very important. Very important. I would like to discuss that if we can. Yes, of course, the amendment four. Yes. Can you tell us what's happening? What is it that they propose? Yes, amendment four, it's this same thing is happening in other states as well. Sadly, in the states that has passed, the worst has happened. And I am going to be truly transparent. Please do not be deceived. This, the way that it is reading, written, it's so deceitful. And they are making you believe that it is something good for women. Amendment four will be horrible. Horrible for our life. Horrible for women. This is not helping women. Amendment four, and I pray and please help me pray and fast that it does not pass. It will be abortion until the moment of birth. If a health professional, which is not identified, a health professional can be a nutritionist, a coach, a mental, a health, whatever the case may be, not necessarily a physician, an MD says, oh, you can have an abortion. You should have an abortion. Whatever the case, that woman can have an abortion up to birth. Talking about parent consent, parents that are listening to me right now, your child, 13, 14 years old, can go and have an abortion and you will be notified, but you do not have to give a consent. This would be horrific for our, for our lives, for our communities, for our communities. And to me, you know, the way that it has been written is so deceitful. And you see commercials, there's a lot of money from the opposition that is being spent on this in favor of amendment four. Voting yes for amendment four will end the lives of thousands and thousands of innocent babies. It will, it will honestly truncate the lives of young moms, young women, young girls, that without their parents being able to help them out, to at least give them an advice, to at least being able to be there for them, it will not happen because there will be no consent. And also, who has the authority to end the life of this child at the moment of birth when there are parents that are praying to be able to adopt a child? Please, please vote no on amendment four. Call your, your family, call your friends and explain to them the danger of this amendment passing. I encourage you to please pray a lot because, you know, let me tell you, life as we know it, it won't be anymore. No, and also what, what could possibly happen after this? You're taking away your rights as a parent to your children, of your children. So I think Mother Teresa said, Mother, Mother Teresa of Calcutta, if we can do this to human life, what's there, what, what is left for us to do? It's like the most sacred thing. We are treating it as if it were disposable. We are tearing families apart. So yes, if you, not only if you respect life, if you care about life, if you care about your faith, if you care about truth, but also if you care about the rights of parents. Human beings, human beings. And this show is about our, we always pray to our Lady of Guadalupe. She is the patroness of the unborn. So always pray to her for guidance and we defend families. Families, and so we will speak about this as the shows go on, but in her eyes, the latest discoveries is that in the iris of our Lady of Guadalupe's eyes is a family and in the center of that family is a woman. So what we're talking about here today is women in the center of society, families as the basis of society, as a nucleus, as an important nucleus, who's going to be there in your best and worst times, usually your family. So it's as if, once again, this hidden agenda that I would love for you to, maybe you have some words on that, but it's as if we're families being attacked constantly and by attacking the woman, family is being attacked. The hidden agenda is taking away the rights of parents and then of course, once the rights of parents will be taken away, then what? What's going to happen? Who's going to guide these children? The other thing is taking away the rights of the father, not eliminating the men and just putting them to the side with nothing. Yes, I understand it's the woman is the one that has a baby, the birth is a baby, that nurtures the baby, that nourishes the baby, I understand, but that father figure is the example of God in our family, St. Joseph, Mary, baby Jesus, that's the family, that's the blessed family. And now we come to the mother, destroying the woman, destroying her heart, piercing her heart with the death of her children. I'm telling you that this agenda is horrific, is to end life as we know it. Life as we know it, I agree. Thank you so much, Marta, for this. Please keep this in mind when you hear of amendment four, tell your friends, speak to family members, don't be afraid to speak about these clinics that help. Don't be afraid to speak up. I think we all have to be a little more braced. We have an example of bravery right here, Marta. And we don't need to be a clinic, Ivania, to help save a life because you know a woman with an unplanned pregnancy and that you hear, that she's going through that, you walk with her, tell her I'm going to take you to a place where they're going to help you, you know, take her to a place like Heartbeat of Miami, it's heartbeatof miami.org and you call us and we will be able to point you to the right direction. So yes, if you have a clinic, that's awesome, but partner with a clinic near you that you can help out. Be the help that she needs. Maybe compromise, I will help you in this material way, shape or form, or I'll be there for you, I'll call you every day. There's so many ways we are called to do, we are called to spread the gospel and spread, which is the word of love, actually. And we all have, it's not like, oh, let's wash our hands, I don't have a clinic, I don't know of anyone, by speaking up, by doing the small things we can reach a large audience. So this is a small show, we have a big, big, big soul here with us. And who knows who it's going to reach. And I encourage everyone who is watching this show, please go on to HeartbeatofMiami.org, go onto their Instagram account, follow them, spread the word. And also you can call us anytime and let us know of your comments. You can call this channel, you can call MariaVision and request for the phone number, request for help. We're always here for you too. Any last words that you would like to say? If there's a young lady out there or a mom that found out that her daughter's pregnant, or if you're pregnant and you don't know what to do, please just think of this, you know, crisis is past. Crisis is our temporary, but life and death is eternal. And just consider seeking help, the right help. That's someone that's going to tell you all about abortion is nothing, that's not true. Seek the right help. If you're a young lady, trust your mom, trust a friend that can really give you the guidance. Most of all, trust God. He has a perfect plan for you and a perfect plan for that baby. So we're here for you. Thank you very much, Matta. Thank you for having me. Thank all of you for watching the show, and I hope to see you next week. Thank you.
