 The lighting was great, like the scene, the environment, and my eyes just kind of made that connection. Like for me, light and color, there's a certain frequency I have to like feel, just like when you like listen to music and that rhythm like hits you. Claudio Eschen, I am super excited to talk to you. I'm very excited to be here, dude. Nice. Like a lot of the other people that have been on before, I mean you have lots of conversations, especially when we're driving out to take photographs. And I'm excited that you're cool sitting down and recording one of those conversations. And much appreciated. So I don't know, can you give a little bit about your background? I think your story is fantastic. And I think you appreciate how much that, or understand how much I appreciate you being a part of the team and our friendship. I know, now you're part of the story and journey too. So I was born in Ghana at the age of two, moved to Italy. And then at the age of nine, moved to Whistler, Massachusetts, where my family and I currently live. And then ever since then, I just kind of grew up trying to find myself as I was undocumented, still kind of I am. But through that journey, I was able to land in Bridgewater State where they accepted me without really looking at any financial background. And then I pursued a biology degree. And through that, I was a freelance photographer. I was really passionate to photography to the point. There was a point where I had to choose if I wanted to pursue a career in biology or art. And that's where I ended up finding a job, a social media job post in, from you guys. And I was like, you know what, I think I'm going to go to grad school at MassArt. And while I'm at grad school at MassArt, I want to pursue a more of our artistic career. And that's where I met you and introduced myself saying, not only I can do social media, but I can do photography and other versatile, creative tasks. And since 2019, I've been here and spend that life. Yes. Yes. I believe like mid-August into September. And ever since, I've just learned a lot about framing, how to present work, and really starting to be that professional artist. I was more of a freelance artist. I was taken seriously, but I was a little nervous on being gallery represented. I honestly felt like I didn't think I was worthy enough or it felt very alienating. Well, I think that that's probably part of that imposter syndrome that everybody has, including podcasts. Yes. Like I even mentioned to you, your brother one time, I had imposter syndrome about being a photographer just because I never thought this early in my career. And I'm 27 to be a professional photographer, be acquired by museums, have conversations with students, teach college students photography. And then beyond photography, like the storytelling, the things that we don't see when we're creating the creative process, what things that you get that's rewarding, the investments you can make through photography and then talking about how to retain your intellectual property or how to market yourself online. The reason why I also talk about that. Me with my immigration background, I felt difficulty sometimes in the real world. So I felt like the digital world, there was no citizenship type situation where you can bring yourself everywhere and still be in one place. And that's kind of how I started thinking and not only marketing myself, but Brandon Dunn-Clawd, this other side of me where it came to be or rose up while I was in high school with a group of friends of us. So we all wanted to be creatives, some of us rappers, models. And now I'm here trying to kind of continue that journey. No, I think your story is great. I appreciate all the hard work that you do in just watching you go through school, go through graduate school, working at other jobs. Because you were working, doing the overnight, showing up here to put in some hours before going to graduate school. It's just much appreciated because I think that everything, you get rid of that imposter syndrome once you have done something long enough and you've kind of hit the fast forward button and you're blasting through a lot of it. It's impressive. Thank you. And honestly, even being here, I feed a lot of information where things that I should add into my creative model, such as the frame in and maybe narrowing it down to certain frame choices, me knowing that if I'm going to frame something, going with museum glass automatic, even if it's a little expensive, making that extra investment. But then also just having fun with it, like I used to be a control freak with a lot of the making. I kind of let that go, a lot of it, just to have more enjoyment in the process. You have that wide cherry looking frame that you've used in the ton of stuff. This one here, you found one of the ones that you have. Yeah, I stood out to me. It was like the textures, the hints of gold. And it started trickling or doing something to me inside when I paired it with this print light shines from her fingers taken in 2021 that was also part of the Hanover Day show. And I don't know that combination and the tones of colors. No, it works fantastic. I think it's cool that it's kind of like an older looking frame with a new, more contemporary looking photograph. It ties in the things. I'm glad that you noticed about the contemporaneous of it because the work that I'm trying to make, I'm trying to think of it as a timeless piece and really trying to make it where it can be in the past, in the present, and in the future. And a little bit of the background of the photograph. So I photograph my family and friends a lot. And this print is my mom, who's a hairdresser who started at the age of 12. And then my sister, who was a cosmetology major in her vocational school. And just like that trickle of passing on not only DNA information, but the roots of learning hairdressing and my sister having that appreciation. And just highlighting themes of ritual, practice, and just passing on information. Now, we've talked a couple of times too. Some of the stuff that you're trying to do is bring awareness to your culture from Ghana and whatnot. Is the hair stuff. Yeah, like hair braiding is known in the African community a lot. And my mom basically learned hair braiding in a very traditional sense. And because she was at the age of 12 and now she's in her 50s, just like that whole journey of carrying that skill sets everywhere she went and finding ways to create a business out of it. How do they feel about being subjects for you when you're shooting? I will say at first. I've seen your mom in a couple shots. I'll be honest. At first it was like a push and pull. But with the ritualness of me photographing, the practice of constantly doing it and then showing them and then having a conversation about why I'm making the work and what they see and feel. After a while they started to understand and to the point once the camera is out they kind of like ready to pose. I will say with my mom and sister it was way more easier. With my brother it took some time. So a lot of the early works you don't really see him and some people are like you have a brother? Yeah. And I'm like yeah I have a brother. And after a few conversations with him and how I'm trying to also express the male figure side of our family. And he now is on board. I think it's cool. It's interesting to see subjects over and over again. People paint the same type of scenes. To see them grow too with the photographs and if you continue to shoot them they become older. It's a cool thing. I don't know what the technical term for something like that is. Bailey's portraiture work. I do have phases where now I'm trying to work more with objects and garments and trying to mix it up. So it's not too overly people centered. And then just also thinking about how to photograph environments without people in it. And now you also added a couple pieces over at the James that we got to peek at last night at the opening reception. Pretty well received. Yeah. It's surprising. Two pieces. Lurking shadows in the State House. And she talked less to do more. And lurking shadows in the State House is the guy with the. And the kente cloth. And that's like a traditional Ghana. That's textile fabric that it's very well known there. And I wanted to use that very fabric that gentlemen is actually me. So sometimes. Yeah. You know someone said that to me and I looked at it and I was like it doesn't look like I tried. That's the Don Claude side that comes out. And basically I try to like morph myself just because it's sometimes difficult to find men of color to work with. And either schedules conflicts doesn't really work. So I've been shifting myself to transform into a figure who is like a male figure to do performative acts in front of the camera like that. And then the kente cloth since with my immigration background I can't leave the country. I have conversation with my family in Ghana by having them send materials to me in America and that garment was sent to by my aunt who owns a story in Ghana. And I was wearing it and remembering. So. Okay. And I mean that's interesting. I think it's cool that you're part of the subject matter also. But is that tricky? Just working timers. Yeah. Timers. And it is tricky but is part of that just staging. You have somebody else hit the button. Sometimes. Yeah. I have somebody staging hitting the button to the point. That day was windy. So I had somebody day to kind of keep an eye on the camera from shaking. The first few tries I clicked wasn't really working. Yeah. So after that I made sure to my assistant to kind of help me click. Just because I wasn't getting back in time. Yeah. Yeah. No. It's you know I mean it just goes to show how like well thought out there. And up the two that was the one that came that got second place. Yeah. And which I never really know how jurors go about it. But yeah I was hoping that she talked less to do more. Yeah. That that shot is me and Don were talking about that this morning because when I saw which ones were there I immediately assumed that that was the one that one because that shot is like I mean it's it's like a perfect shot. I think it's great. And I mean I don't know a lot about the technical end of you know taking those photographs. I more at the you know the back end I see a lot of things when I'm getting ready to frame them and that one just is perfect and it's I don't know if it's the lighting. No it is definitely the lighting. The way you staged it. Because when I saw it and that family the LaHans family reached out to me to do a portrait family portrait for them. Every time somebody like hires me for like a job or a gig in the back of my head I always want to make like one or two images. Yeah. That like resonate with the body of work I'm creating. So in the process the lighting was great like the scene the environment and my eyes just kind of made that connection. Like for me light and color there's certain frequency I have to like feel just like when you like listen to music and that rhythm like hits you. And because of that the lighting I was like this is perfect. And I basically told Jeff to kind of stand stale the gentleman in the background and ask his family and his wife and children to kind of walk towards him while he's standing still. And I took a few shots but then there was just like the leg of the child of the young child brought me back into like my own young self when I was like a little wild and like a little stubborn and just want to be playful all the time. But and then there's like the hiding my mom's face or a woman who represented my mom as she's not a woman who talks a lot. She's more about actions. So that that was what was going on. How is that? And you show up to that shoot and you in that like pieces together are they receptive or like it took some time. Because they're like they're supposed to be taking our picture. Yeah. Which I did. Yeah. But then I don't know as soon as I made the image I show them or at least showed it to Jeff saying that well Jeff like I think I'm onto something with a few of these like I want to show it to you and would it be comfortable for you and your wife to kind of look at them to approve it. Because I know this children involved you guys are involved and I want to be respectful of that. Yeah. And once I got the approval I was like very thankful and pleased and they even came to my show and they signed in person and they they understood and they like I mean are they excited and like proud to be like that. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean like when I see that like you could see that that could be a magazine shot that you could see it like in a museum like that. Harvard Art Museum. Yeah. That's the one that's in the Harvard. Yeah. Like I mean I mean Don we're having the conversation when I was this morning I was telling her how you know we're going to sit down and we're talking about that when I was like oh that's not the one that got the prize and you know same thing. It's just like that could be the photograph you hang your hat on right. Like I mean I'm sure that you'll produce other ones that are you know you got a long ways to go but like that one is just stunning. No thank you. You know you got some other ones I got a. Before we move on I do want to say that if folks want to check out two of Prince or other local artists in the show at the James Library that's on Vito November 23rd so please please stop by and take a look. Yeah. No I would highly recommend People Stop By because there's some other great works there too. And did you get to meet the woman that won the show. Yes first. Oh my goodness. Yes the water reflection. It's wild how it looks as real as you would be like in the Caribbean's and the clear water scene like. She's wild. Yeah. No you can tell. I was talking with Bill and the guy who Jared who does the sculptures who has a show coming up there. You know we were kind of closing up the place and she was still there and I got introduced to her because Bill is like oh you should meet. Interesting woman. Interesting backstory too. Yes and I love how she's like hustling or how she hustled to get where she's at and now she's an educator at Tufts too. She's Holland. I forgot her last name but I just wanted to say at least say the first name. Yeah she was an intern for Warhol. Oh yeah. That was crazy. But super interesting lady. She said that you want to come to the thing because I was asking her how she made it and she was like telling me and hopefully I'll get a chance to follow up with her. And try to talk to her more because she seemed super interesting. Yeah how she's collecting recycled bottles and repurposing them. I love that whole initiative. The whole story was fascinating and to come to the second place to her is. Oh no. I'll take it. I'll take it. As soon as I saw it online and in person too I honestly understood. You got it. Yeah I totally understood. Truthfully entering contest grants. It's always like once you enter you also got to let go of it a little. Not take it personal. Exactly. I feel like I've had that conversation with a number of people too and it's always the judge. I mean who knows who the judge is and who knows if they have a bias against something that you're a style or they just want to see all cat pictures. Or maybe they like landscapes more than portraits. Because in their head they're putting together something too right. And you've been on the other side of things. Yes I have. And I've been a juror once and it was for a college student show and it was very intense because it was like what over 300 submissions and you have to choose three and I ended up giving my stipend away to make it four. Because I was like yeah there's a lot of good work. And so I really applaud people who do this on a regular basis. Yeah well my guess is that you'll probably be doing some more of it at some point. But you think about it. I mean they're essentially curating a show which I know you've had experience with that. I saw the show you put together at MassArt. As they're selecting the stuff they're you know I don't know. Maybe they just pick out oh I like that one a lot. I like that one there's no tie in but you know somebody's got to like then hang them and you know. So you'd like to think that they're somewhat conscious of you know they're putting a body of work together. I'm not thinking something. So I don't know interesting. I also want to break out this one. Yeah the. Let's switch the room real quick. Yeah. That one is this is one of your early works. Yes. So this is like while I was in undergrad at Bridgewater State every weekend or so I would have photo shoots with people on campus friends. And Kyla was one of the people that I wanted to work with. She's very energetic bubbly so I was like oh the color yellow would be a good way for her to highlight her personality. Prior to going to grad school I wasn't really thinking about the work as much as more of just going what what aesthetically was pleasing to me. And then from there I started shifting towards like my mom. But yeah this is like one of the first early works and like I was very excited because I was stepping away from the traditional way of framing. And I used to like either go like Michael's a Walmart for framing. And like this is like a whole new shift when I came across like frame center. Yeah frames and the relationship of how to present the work. Yeah I think we even used this we framed it two different ways to kind of you know show it you know show how you know you can use frames and you know how there's not always there's not always a right or a wrong. I mean some things look better than others but some of that's just so you know just personal and you know what's right to me might not be right to you or you know as a photographer I guess you're trying to get what's right to a larger part of the audience so that people are drawn in. But you know we did it the two ways and I think you know we even put it out and like got feedback from you know again not not a right not a wrong. You know I'm glad I ended up with this one. Yes there's only two of them so that's good. Yeah no it you know it means a lot to me this was the one that you gave me for you know I don't know maybe we've got the year on it. Yeah let's take a look. Let's take a look. 2021. Yes. Yes that one's you know in you know I like the yellow a little bit better that was my choice in the beginning anyway but you know where it goes is where it hangs it has you know the brightness works really well for me. Like the frame in of it and the texture of the frame and the texture of the orange it was like wild to me. Yeah yeah and I think that's what really like gravitates toward like wow really start thinking about presentation. Yeah and I'm you know I was lucky enough to receive that as a as a gift from you for you know on a Christmas and you know again super meaningful to me it has you know when we talk about like stories behind the frame and having the like you know the note that you wrote to me on the back like I'm just like oh this is like such a piece with such a story behind it you know and the fact that it's you know some of your earlier work you know I don't know you know and something that was like you were in the works with you you know when I first you know met you it's cool for me is like a nice like record for me of watching you progress because I'm excited to watch it you know all of your steps come and excited to be part of the story as I'm sure everybody else here is you know. With anything exciting coming up I know that you're working on another interesting project with that with the yes if you're not ready to unveil that. We can talk about a little you know I've been kind of quiet 2024 just because I want to start re-showing or popping out more as an artist in 2025 and basically creating like a green card series with clear acrylic sheets and then hedging the work authorization cards that I have using a laser cut in basically I call myself a photo based artist because of the not only make traditional photographs but then I also manipulate the photographs with modern current conventional technology such as laser cut in or screen printing or creating a digital negative and keeping as is but the green card series it will be showcased well it's like I'm like putting out in the air but definitely is going to be at the 13 Horace Gallery it's a gallery in Boston specifically I believe Arlington don't quote me just yet. You're from Worcester. Yeah you don't know that. You know thank you thank you for saving me but I'm very much excited to showcase the work and then also showcase a new work at Harvard on December 3rd and I know that for sure because they told me that I will be doing it then and basically I'll be showcasing new work that I've been making this year as a way to get myself back into showcasing work. Nice and you said are you working specifically with a few galleries now too? Right now actually 13 Horace Gallery is going to be the gallery that's going to represent me. We're slowing the works of finalizing things but I'm very much excited for them to represent me as I've had many conversations with them that came to many of my shows. We had a few studio visits in my studio in Boston so it's just kind of like I felt like it was the right time and the right fit. Nice. Well I'm sure it will work out well for you and like I said hopefully that doesn't mean you can't hit your head over to his next year. They'll still let you put some stuff out in other places. Harvard's another one too that working there is that an interesting... It definitely is. Because a lot of my work is navigating different institutions and just being there I've learned or I've gained a lot of insight on ways to educate folks on how to be their own version of an artist or the creative process and how sometimes the overthinking can take away from the creativeness of the fun of the drawing of making and just going from there rather than trying to get something perfect because I don't believe in anything that's perfect. The creative process as you're teaching some of that stuff too I feel like you're reinforcing the beliefs that you need too. It helps you become that master. Just talking about masters just helped me even become a better problem solver I'll say with the ideas because they'll come with the projects I'm like what? And then just trying to break it down and work backwards and execute it especially in a very short timely manner. Yeah and you still can learn from the students too right? Me and Jacob talked about that a while back about how you... People that need to learn come with great ideas. Yeah and I'm like oh my goodness how do you think of that because sometimes I don't want to touch my prints and break them apart and then some students are breaking their prints apart and putting them back together in a different way and it's inspiring because for me the print is very precious and students may sometimes not see it like that and I love that curiosity of just exploring and experimenting. Awesome well I'm excited you sat down with me I'm trying to think if there's any other things I wanted to ask you about. I feel like there's going to be more. I feel like you're around so I can probably get you back here. But fantastic photographer and great guy and I'm excited to see what else you know what comes next and I love seeing you get more involved down this area too. I love what you're doing in this area and that's why I'm still commuting all the way here just because of your initiative and your effort and you really mean it from just being in frame center but also when you're out in the community in different art organizations, doing studio visits and it's like not an easy task managing both or trying to be a CEO and also husband and father. I definitely applaud you. It's a challenge but it's you know I mean the great thing about those rides when we're going to some of those places that you know hopefully we'll see more of your work at. We you know. 20-25. 20-25. You know it's fun I mean those are I mean that's a that's a fun you know it's usually a fun ride we're joking around having good conversations and then you know getting to a place like you know South Shore or North River and then walking around and looking at you know cool artwork and you know cool things that people are creating is always a blast. I always love hearing like the mini stories of you young Nate. Yeah yeah yeah I'm telling you. Yeah that's great. Well you know when we bring my father on the podcast we'll revisit a lot of those. Awesome well thanks Claude for sitting down with me and you know people can also see things on Claudio. Claudioeshen.com or Don Claude on the store on the store on Instagram. Yeah awesome and you know definitely now I'm thinking of other things for you know episode part two of Don Claude or you know maybe that's what we'll have you come back as. And really last last thing to really say I may be doing a workshop with North River Art Society in January so stay out on the lookout. Yes awesome well thanks Claude we will catch up more.
