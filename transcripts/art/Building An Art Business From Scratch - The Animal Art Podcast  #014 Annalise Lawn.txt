Annalise is a talented watercolor artist from Melbourne, Australia. She creates custom pet portraits as well as a wide range of gifs and prints featuring her work. In this episode, we discuss techniques that go into creating lifelike fur textures, balancing commission work with personal projects, and building an art business from scratch. Plus, why using premium materials can actually save you time. As we talked, we both drew a cat's eye, which is exercise number 50 from the practice journal Pet Portrait Edition. This is all coming up in the show today, so get your materials ready if you're drawing along at home. And let's go! So please tell me a bit about yourself and how you got started as an animal painting artist and tell me a bit about your medium as well. So my name is Annalise. I'm based in Australia, so this is really fun having two different time zones. I started painting pets during lockdown. So good old COVID lockdown, I think. I'm not sure what happened in the UK, but we had about a couple of years of lockdown. I don't know if I like it. Yeah. Oh, it's just hectic. And everyone loved their pets and my neighbour down the street were doing a paint off. So she was doing watercolor powsers and putting them in people's letter boxes. And we've got a lot of pets in our streets. So I thought, I'm going to just paint pets. My camera. So I just started to paint people's pets for fun. And then my sister suggested I start up an Instagram account. I was like, okay, well, we'll do that. And then kept on posting. And now it's my full-time job, just like you. It's wonderful. It's wonderful. It's really fun. So what did you used to do before? I have a Bachelor of Food and Nutrition Science, which I never used. It is always fun. And then these days, I paint, I now do event managing. So I run some markets in my area. And then run my own market still selling cute cards and all of that, which yeah, it's amazing how going into uni thinking one thing and then coming here and doing something completely different. Yeah. Yes, I wanted to ask you why watercolor. I don't know. Oh, that's my simple thing. I don't know. My mom's an art teacher. So I've heard art around me and we got the beautiful Cuy Nor pallets, which these are the original ones that I started painting pets with. And then yeah, I just I love the flow. I love the ability to build, which I guess you get from pencil. And I see a lot of people doing pencils. So I thought, why not watercolor? Yes, definitely. I find watercolor impossible. I can't get my head around it. So I'm just so interested to understand your process and what you do. So like, what are you doing right now? Right now, no, like this is a huge I compared to what I normally paint. Oh, I keep on bumping my camera. This is fun. I with eyes normally I start with like the base color, which I can see that you'll be doing with the past so like making sure because the eyes are so much different for the fur. Where I just paint literally each hair one by one without a base layer. Without a base layer. So like that's one that I've been working on. Oh, it's beautiful. Just each hair one by one. Driving me mental, but I would not do anything else. Like sometimes I'm guessing you get the point where when you do a portrait, you're like, oh, it's going through the ugly stage, you need to start over and then you push through it and you're like, oh, okay. Yeah, I feel like you get that a lot with watercolor. Especially like you guys have rubbers. So I can sort of use rubbers. I've had to use a couple of like the rubbing out technique when my cat decided to join in a watercolor portrait. Oh, no. No. He was tiny and he decided that he wanted to get in. I'd freshly made some paint for myself and he stepped in it and it's a beautiful red pigment, which I might actually use, like a burnt umber and he just stepped all over the portrait. No, in red. In red. Oh, it was it killed me. Did you have to start again? I was able to. There's this technique where you just like flood it with water. Right. And then you can lift it with q-tips. Which sounds interesting. Which was painful because you know red pigments, I'm guessing you get it with the color, the pencils. Red pigments have that little bit stronger staining ability. Even though it's one of the first colors to bleach. It lifted quite well. I messaged the customer on my home. So sorry. And they just all, oh, I didn't notice it. Oh, good. It's a challenge if you did the mistake or let's say something. It's like, oh, okay. Oh, that's just for nothing. I don't know who has like sleepless, stressful times when you're just like, oh, yeah, I can't see it. No, I feel that sometimes as well when I've done a commission or something. And I feel like, you know, I normally only send it out like, you know, if I'm 100% happy with it. Yeah. But there are just some like, you know, niggling things like, oh, should I work on it a bit longer? Or should I have, you know, stopped several layers ago or, you know, that kind of thing. And then you send it like, I always send a picture to the client first so they can approve it before I send it to them. And it's just so like, oh, you know, when they say, oh, it's fantastic. I love it. You're like, oh, thank goodness. Weight off my shoulder. Yeah. Oh, that's like, oh, I'm so pleased. I had that, like, you know, it's normally the ones with time crunch to me. Like, oh, I really need it for this day. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then the more you paint, like, what's happening, do I start over? This is not, oh my goodness, I can go bumping this. Yes. It's all right. I get all the time day. It's always the ones with time crunches that always you're like, oh my goodness. This isn't working right. The pencils aren't deciding to pencil. But for me, my brushes have decided to go in retirement. What do I do? And then they're like, oh my God, it's perfect. It's like, oh, I'm so glad you didn't see the stress behind it. Yeah. That's a thing because nowadays you have to, like, record all of your artwork. All right. Instead of just take a picture at nice stages. And I just feel like it adds to the stress somehow. That you have to make sure that you have time to stop tape photos, tape footage. Yeah. Then do it and then. You sort of like get in with the flow and stuff and like, it was so much easier in the day. Yeah. It was easier in the day where you could just leave a camera on and do a time lapse. Because then you can just forget about the camera and just leave it running as you're drawing and painting. And people would find that interesting. But now people are, I'm done with that. What else? Yeah. It's like, oh no. But I liked doing that. It is interesting. Let's see what people like on social media. And I had one viral video of just my brushes and then post a video, like finishing a portrait. And it's like, oh, okay, a couple of thousand. Okay. It's a weird world right now trying to get out there. Yes, definitely tricky. It's why it's good to try and not rely, I think, on social media to make your money. Yeah. It's more of like a way of being out there and showing what you're doing. But you're not relying on it for gaining clients. Because I think it's just with the algorithms, it can be very unpredictable. Oh, it is. Yeah. Bonkers. So when did you start doing like pet portraits and all that? Oh, I feel old. It was like eight years ago now. Eight years ago. And look at you. Yeah. There's proof in the pudding. But yeah, you thought we would have seen all the different changes, the different trends. Yeah, definitely. Because I remember when I first, because I used to do videos actually quite a lot of, like I called them finishing touches videos. And it was when you're like putting like the finishing whiskers or something on it. And those did so well on Facebook. And now people seem to hate videos on Facebook. Well, they do on my page anyway. Like I get no comments or anything. But they love pictures. So it's just trying to understand what platform people like certain things. And it can change. So you just need to keep that in mind when you're doing it. Yeah. Yeah. I just, you know, these days I'm like, I'm not, it sounds really weird. I'm not creating content for others. I'm creating the content for me. Like the way that I see this, my Instagram is a portfolio. Like. Yeah. And almost I have a mentor and she said to me, present your Instagram as it's a dinner party and you're inviting guests to it. What are they going to see? And yeah, I need to show my customers the real me because that's who they're going to be talking to. And yeah, exactly. Why pretend to be someone else when I want to attract the same people with the same energy that I have? Mm-hmm. It's, no, that's good. That's a good way of seeing it. How am I going to attract those people? Because it's easy to get sucked in, isn't it? And feel like, because I definitely do that sometimes as well. It's like, oh, but I've got all these followers and they're not seeing it. And you just can get frustrated and, you know, why isn't it working? And then one day it does work. And you're like, oh, well, that's how you do it. And then you try again the next day is like, and it doesn't work. It's like, oh, give me, give me something, please. Oh, God, I thought I nailed this. Oh, yeah, I got the viral video. Let's let's do another one. Oh, okay. That video just, um, oh, okay. It's even a wish to talk. I feel like I'm late to talk. I feel like you just have to use social media, what it's for, which is to be social. So like what we're doing now, we're using it to have a live and a chat and like just hang out. And I think that's what you just need to use social media for is just networking and chatting to people and just being social. Yeah. And that's, I think that's the one good thing about social media is that we can now, like you're in the UK. Yeah. I'm in Australia. Back then it would have been pigeons. Senty little dorks in via pigeon. I am up to this bit on the eyeball. I am up to this bit. That's how I'm done now. Oh, pigeon. I was done like months ago. Here's the photo of the pigeon. Oh, they're so funny. Do you find watercolour to be quite a fast medium then? I find it quite slow. I'm guessing that you get it the same. There's so much to build upon. Yes. All the layers, isn't it? It's, and it's the layers like you can't fast track. And like looking at this eye, I'm like, oh my goodness, there's all these different yellows. All these different variations of yellows. I feel like it's harder for you watercolour because it dries a different colour. Then you put it on, no? So how do you know what colour you're using? That's what I want to know. Please tell me. I guess. Literally, I had that thought the other day of like, oh, quickly show my palette. That's what my palette looks like. And I'm just like, I'm like, it sounds really, I'm just guessing. I'm just really, really guessing. And I think that's what I love about it. Yeah. It is quite late, not really late. It's like 9.18pm in Australia. So I just had dinner. I got my cup of tea. I used to paint this late when I was working and painting. Now I've got the luxury of not painting earlier. Painting earlier. Painting my pyjamas. I think like how many of us are artists? They'll be like, hmm, yeah. Sometimes I paint or pack orders in pyjamas. I'm really guilty of that. Well, you can do that when you work from home, can't you? Yeah. Oh, it can. But sometimes it surprises me when I've got a customer picking up their order and I forget and I'm in my pyjamas. Oh, hi. Hi. But then also that's me. I am honestly so impressed with these books that you created. I like it. I love it. My grandfather came over and I showed him, like, look what I've got. I'm so excited for this. And he's like, but why did you get it on my... It's like my own personal development thing. Like 100% will be using and practicing a lot the poodles. I don't know about you, but I hate curly hair dogs. It's definitely a tactic to it. Yeah. And I don't get them enough that it's like, I said, I probably will have a whole lot now. I don't get a lot in a row for it to be really in my brain. And then the moment I get it, I'm like, oh, here, I remember this. And then it's almost like retraining yourself. You've got one in here and it's a red, the red poodle, I want to say. Yeah. I'm glad that nobody's asked to do that live yet. I'll be watching that live when you do it. Oh, no. No. I might just turn that one into a tutorial. I think that would be better. Yeah. Well, you can just be like, oh, I'm doing this over a couple of days. Yeah. Do you have... They haven't been taking me too long, actually. They've been all right about, I'd say up to two hours maximum for these. Okay. And I guess it also depends on what detail you want to focus on. Me and Brian are really focusing on the eye and the veins while you're going more for the hair. Okay. Every now and then I look up and I'm like, oh, you're up to this. No, I've honestly been like using this book myself as a way of getting quicker because now that I have a kid, like I don't have as much time as I used to. So I want to be, you know, as good, but quickly. You know? Yes. So that's what I've been mainly using this book for. Oh, I love that. And like when you suggested to me using the paper rather than going straight on it, that's going to be really helpful when they are today. I really need to practice those curls again. I really need to practice those curls and even practicing in different colors. Do you have a... Yeah, definitely. Read or love anything that you love when you get a lover. I have a breed that I owe. I don't know. No, it's, I small that I, the problem I have is that I like a challenge. Yeah. So the more complicated it is, the more I like it. That's my issue. So yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Give me 10 multi-colored poodles. I will be very excited. You know, that's, that's what I quite, I also really like it when I get a customer ask me to do a drawing from like several reference photos and like add them all together and like, you know, they don't even have the reference photo that they want. I feel like that's a really cool challenge because it gives me a bit of, I guess, artistic license to come up with a really nice composition for them using their pictures. And it's a little bit more exciting than just sort of being a photocopier. So I do actually prefer the more complicated stuff. I love them. Everyone asks me like, oh, do you must hate painting white pits? And I love painting white pits. It's the black. It's black that actually challenges me. Really? I feel like black is so much easier. Why do you struggle with black? There's so many variations about, I'll show you, like on my palette that I made here on the black. Like to me, this is really blue black when I need it to be brown black. It's, it's a really interesting thing. And black is really hard to layer up because then it starts getting pasty. What do I say? Versus white. I'm using washes of, um, washes of color where, yeah, sometimes it's a green wash. If it's like, you can clearly see the dogs being in grass or like mulled teasers where they've got that true red wash around their mouth. Yeah. Yeah, I just, I love painting white pits because you get a little bit more freedom, I guess, with the watercolor. Do you use the paper a lot with white pits then and have the paper as the color? Or do you cover the whole paper still? I do use the, the paper a lot. I'm just trying to think, yeah, use the paper. But a lot of the times it will be like the backing almost how you do the pastel. And then build up on it. So lots of grays, although I still use white watercolor that's still not the white. For my card series, I painted a Japanese spitz and a white, um, a white cat. And that was really fun. It was different whites. It was, oh, I love those. I'm also excited in your book, there's fish. There's fish. There's fish. Are you going to try that next then? Yeah. Yes. I have painted a fish. And do I have them with me? You would like, this is one thing that I don't think you can get your pencils. I've got these beautiful, handmade, oh, wow. Shimmer watercolor. So beautiful. And this is why I wish I do watercolor. And these ones are multi-cone. What brand are those? These are handmade. They're called Shimmer Drops. She's based in, um, based in Australia. Oh, that's funny. So they're all handmade. They're nice. And they smell like clove because she's like the preservative in it. Yeah. So that's what I'm excited to do with the fish and just add those tiny little details that will just... Hello, that would look amazing. Yeah, that's going to look so amazing. And then you want to do watercolor. Yeah. I would like to try, but I'm also very scared. Don't be silly. It is honestly so much fun. I think it's just letting the brush do and not fight. So that's one thing. Yes, give me some bigger tips then. Don't be frightened. Okay. Not a lot of water. I don't use a lot of water. Okay. Half the time I've got a tissue near me and I like dab it off or like you'll always hear me like wiping against my jar. So like it doesn't bleed too much or something. Yeah. So then I can have more control because I think that's one thing. You see, I see a lot of watercolor artists and they do big washes and the washes are really watery. Right. And then they paint on top of that and that's when you don't have the control over the paint. And that's when it starts to go. I could probably use that technique here. So it you flood it a bit. So imaginary painting. And then add the paint and you can see how the paint just sort of goes on its own little writing and then it creates those harsh borders sometimes. It's a really interesting thing. Definitely. I feel like pencil or my my thoughts of pencil. I just get so annoyed at the pencil not being sharp enough all the time. Really? And you should not should get one of these. I love this sharpener so much. It's a really heavy brass sharpener and it's just it's just fantastic. I use it all the time. I've got my little tabletop bin and sharpen it in there. Sort of. Yeah. I haven't emptied it in the two years that I've been using it. You've got my little in the key. I feel like when you fill that up you need to put resin in it. Yeah. It looks like a little in there. A trophy of your ear sharpening. But I think it's really good for how much you haven't sharpened. I guess because I use so like I've got every pencil. Yeah. So I just go through them and I don't need to sharpen them that often I guess because I use so many like I keep switching so much. You know what I mean? And also it's not normally like a couple of turns anyway. So yeah. Because you constantly are using it. Have you found it like a color that you haven't matched? Or have you been able to match just about every single color or blend? There are some things like that you get with like I don't know maybe Tabby cats. They've got this sort of like brown ocher-y greeny color that can be quite hard to match. But then I have actually found I think this is actually quite a good color for it. It's called earth green. And this is such a good undertone for stuff. But like you wouldn't necessarily know unless you try them all out. And then Karen Dash came out with a new color a couple of years ago called what is this? Middle, the third, third digress. I can't believe that. And this actually has been so useful. I've been using it quite a lot. It's getting shorter and shorter. So. I like that the nice nail color for you. Yeah. This is really lovely. It's sort of like minty green isn't it? Yeah. I love it. I've been using this quite a lot as well. So I don't know. I also think that sometimes if it's not exactly like the color in the picture, that's okay. Because it's sort of like your interpretation. Because again, we're not photocopiers. We're artists. We're trying to get the overall look and feel and especially when it's a pet. We're trying to get the personality and the character and the life. And I don't think it necessarily matters that that's not the exact yellow or that's not the exact green. It's just meant to be sort of what it is in that picture. Because yeah, because also they change color in the sunlight. They change color in the house. Like the cat and the dog and pets are always looking slightly different colors anyway when you see them in real life. So I don't think it's that important to get the exact color. Yeah. That's amazing. I need to send you a photo of a customer who sent me a photo that I can use this as a reference. You'll just laugh. It's hilarious. The pet wasn't in focus at all. Because yeah, like what you're saying about color though, if you're in focus, I've got a tux in your cat. But in the sunlight, he's this, like the only thing that's reflected is, he's almost like marmite or vegemite color. It's, he's black, but he's got that brown undertone that yeah, only sunlight can catch. Yeah, I always love pets in sunlight. I always ask my customers, could you have a picture of them in the sunlight? Because it does shine differently. And I feel like you can capture a lot more different depths of color. You get the true colors I reckon in sunlight. And better detail that's always the hardest. I'm guessing you get the same with memorial pieces when it is an older photo. And it's not like you can ask for more, you can just piece your thought. And you just want to, like, I find memorials are the hardest because you want to do the best possible for them. And yeah, just wanting to make it look like them. But like, oh, can you add more detail? And so, oh yeah. And then it's that guessing game. Like, okay, if I was detail, where am I? I guess that's where the knowledge of anatomy and just generally research as well really comes in handy. In practice. Yeah. Lots and lots of practice. So I think that's one thing I realized I forgot about, even though I paint a lot and I paint a lot of people's pets, I forget to personally practice. And staying. So I think you know, keep on hustling, keep on painting. Like, because I literally made this book for myself. And I thought, well, maybe other people might want something like this, since I've really needed something like this, because I just, I just wanted to have a chance to try out different paper, try out different techniques, try out different mediums. And I just never really find the time because I'm always doing commissions. Yeah. And so I thought, oh, why don't I just do like little squares of stuff. So it started off as like, my idea was just like a sheet of paper, basically, of like different, different parts of fur and then just try those out. And I thought, oh, wouldn't it be cool to like do that, you know, the rule of 100 where you do something 100 times and then, you know, you're a master at it kind of thing. And I thought, oh, when my husband was like, oh, won't you do a book of 100 pictures? He's like, oh, okay, a book of 100 pictures. And now that Amazon can like print, I thought I can do a book for myself. That would be really cool. I thought, oh, might as well, you know, see if other artists need it. And it's just been, it's just blown up. I mean, people really, really love this idea. And I'm just so happy that I could be the one to share it with people and make something that people enjoy. It's helpful. Whether you are starting out or this is your 632,000 portrait. Yeah. And you just realize that you haven't painted an annoying poodle in a while. And you've just seen the headache of the cows and you're going, okay, I need to just spend an hour looking at these girls in the book rather than looking at the customers per girls. But yeah, I think it's just so helpful. It's amazing. You know, the thing that you think, oh, I should do this for myself has become something that people go, wow, I actually need that. I need this in my life to assist. And yeah, with the fact that Amazon, like this book was printed in Sydney. So cool. All the way from the UK. All the way from your brain to the UK. Here. Yeah. What? From something. It's very cool. And I like your idea. And I think I'm going to start practicing that at timed, not timed as in pressure, but time. Yeah. Okay, I've got an hour. Let's work on this cat's nose. Because I know that there's features that I've either spent too long on it or overthought for too much over on one piece. So I think this will be good to really refining and controlling, I guess. Not controlling. I'm just trying to figure out the right word of like, just ensuring that the quality is the same, but giving myself that time and precision still. Yes, definitely. And I also have come up with the, there's the British Wildlife edition of this now. And it's filled with British wildlife ones. You've not seen it yet. No, I need to. Yeah, look, this is a British wildlife one. So like, Oh, I could do. I think you should. It's not on my list right now, but it will be for the future. We've just done possums and we've got possums here. Oh, that's true. Yeah, well, that is actually for a client in Australia. So I think, I think we need to do. Yeah. Yeah. Now, okay, it will be on my list for the future, but right now I've got 10 others. I've been working on so because I've also, I've just released the florals edition. So if you're interested in practicing flowers and greenery and raindrops and dew drops on petals and all that kind of stuff, that's all in the florals edition. And then I'm currently working on the African wildlife one. Elephants and giraffes and lions and all that kind of stuff. I'm very excited about because I've literally never drawn any of this ever. And it's been really fun because I draw the covers myself. So all of the ones on the cover are my drawings. So it's been nice to sort of practice and have that on the cover as like just to show what's possible for the bird. So I've been doing that for the African wildlife one. And then I've got a human portrait one coming out. So if you want to practice human portraiture. Oh good. That but I don't know about you but human scummy. Human portrait scummy. I don't know like there's something about human portraits that I'm just like no, no. Have you done much of it? I have done one portrait and it was a side profile with a dog and its owner. And luckily it was quite easy but gosh no. I will never advertise that I do humans. They just I don't know there's just something about it. No. Oh what about you? Have you done humans? Yes I've done quite a lot actually. I really like it. I used to do it all the time for my friends at school like I because you know I didn't have any money or anything when you're at school and I used to just draw a portrait of them and give it to them for their birthday. That was just all I did so all my friends like you know years of portraits of themselves you know or like a portrait of us together and that kind of thing. I think I was born in the wrong year. Maybe back in the Renaissance or yeah. Yeah you'd be surely paint during the kings and queens. Thanks. Then I could be a kept woman. Paint all day. But how bizarre she has a job and she paints. I think I'm born in the perfect year actually especially with social media. Where we love our pets crucially. Yes. People love their pets equally as crucially as I do. Do you have pets then? I've got two cats. Oh lovely. They are absolutely bonkers. They're two boys and I love them to pieces and they tolerate me. I'm just a little bit of a fan. What about you? Tell me more about your cats. Like what breed are they? I can't logistically but it's fine. I still got my remote. I've got my um yeah we've got boys and here's an x-straight. So you see we've got our backyard and then we coached him in. We showed him that fumes are nice and now he is he's domestic. It's gonna be evil. Cry for food. He will beg for him. He loves being tucked up in bed. He is a he hit the truck. So this is boy. I've actually got him on cards. Oh he's beautiful. He's an eight kilo cat. Wow he's a beautiful cat. Oh he's lovely. Oh I love him to pieces and then we I say recently it's been two to three years. Recently adopted this one and that one's Percy who likes to paint with me. Oh so cute. He's a typical tuxedo. They spray themselves a bit. He loves dogs. He'll actually run after the dogs in our street. He plays with them. Yep he's missing brain cells but I love him at the same time. Oh he's got green eyes. Yeah green like that. I think it's almost that color that you're showing that green. Yeah this one so this would be a good color for you. Dorm and color pencil. I think if I was gonna yeah I always practice with my pets first. Yeah I feel like it's very handy. But also I'm like. That's like it's your water color it's lovely and unique and I'm just loving how this eye is progressing it's just so interesting to see it develop. Oh I'm like I keep on looking at yours I'm like ooh. Because normally I leave eyes to the last. See you that's funny. If they go through that freaky stage I'm like ooh like you don't look right. But then the moment I finish the eyes I'm like oh yep painting's done. I can scan it you send it off. So why do you like to do the eyes last? I think because I can clean my palette. I've never actually really I don't think there's a reason why I do it last it's just being habitual. But then it varies so when I was doing the white cat I actually did her eyes first. And then built around the eyes because being white it's I wanted to actually something to look at while painting. Yes okay. But you know with the eyes I think because they're just such a treat. Like almost they are my dessert I guess. Yeah I see. And I just very. Interesting. Yeah they can just transform so you start with the eyes. Yeah again for that sort of same reason like they're my favorite part to do. So I like to do it. I don't want to wait till the end no I don't want to do it now. I don't want my dessert after food I want them afterwards. So yeah I always do the eye first and then I feel like I've got a focal point to develop because I always start from the eyes and then the nose and then sort of like spread out from there with the fur. This is weird I do backwards. That's so funny. I do fur and then either ears if it's like the cavalia ears or nose then eyes or sometimes nose ears eyes but that's really weird. Yeah that's the way that you do the complete opposite. And I've noticed I do it a lot like so many other people. Another artist I'm not sure if you know her. Caitlin Grace Art. She does it back. Well I do it backwards. She does it technically the right way like you. There's no right way. I love seeing how people work it's almost like being at markets. Seeing clay is one of those awesome things that makes me go wow. It's the same mud same particles of glass and materials and all that. And then you put it under high temperature and it all turns out different. Yes. Yeah and that's what I love like running the market being at a market just seeing all the different materials like same materials but different uses. It's just amazing what our brains are able to do. Sometimes even the same materials with us is like you know I've done color pencil drawings with other color pencil artists and it always looks different and specifically the other artist style like you can just tell who's drawn what and I find that so interesting. And it's refreshing. That's it. It's really refreshing because you don't want to know that like there's a reason why people go for you. There's a reason why they capture like I was watching some of your reels and I Holy Moly using the pastels really captures those undertones. Like that really doesn't versus some people they just they don't use that. They just like do a whole lot of layering with the strokes. That's like wow it's moving more against same materials. Yeah. Definitely can create the same outcome and that's what I'm really looking forward to seeing the difference in these eyes. Definitely. Same reference. Two artists. I'm going to claim that two different times zone makes it different as well. Yes. We're literally across the world from each other during a scene. It's actually kind of magical you know I find it's it's just so cool to like be able to we've both got the same book and we're drawing the same thing and you know we're world's apart and it's just it's just very exciting. My family's actually from England and I go yeah you go oh yeah we're off to the pub now and I'm like wait if it's this time here how is it that time why are you going to a pub now it's all because I can't yeah. You can I guess. Yes. That's funny. But that's what I love about yeah the fact that you can go on a TikTok live and people are yeah I'm watching it from France. What? Like I would never thought back I'm just trying to think like Emerson was probably the closest to travel chatting when I was little. But I only talked to my friends though that I saw at school like I saw you know I go but how are you doing? Yeah like I just literally saw you but how you going what are you doing? Yeah and now yeah perfectly two strangers can talk to each other on social media catch up. What? And learn I'm learning so much from you about watercolor I'm very tempted to try I do have a set of watercolors I've got these Windsor and Newton ones. Um the black is that good? No I was in Newton. Yeah it's always I found out so many things like going to the art shop I never realized um so there's a brand called Rembrandt I think. They are the higher quality of I sometimes use the Van Gogh watercolor paint and they were telling me this has half of the pigment of this brand so this is like the um not key perversion but it's like the next level down versus um same with Windsor and Newton so I use Windsor and Newton white and some of the other ones do I actually have it here maybe? They've got um Kotman Kotman Windsor and Newton owns them and they have just a little bit less pigment dense than what Windsor and Newton have so I love tracking these people. Yeah that was very interesting because I don't really know much about watercolor paint I just bought the Windsor and Newton because I love Windsor and Newton as a brand yeah like I always used to use their paper and and you know anything else they have um so I just bought their watercolor set without really knowing you know if it's in actually any good or not. What's in it? I find the um their paints are quite beautiful they're nicely mould so um one thing I've learned I've dabbled in making my own watercolor. Is you sort of you sort of grind it extra on glass so you have like this glass muller and you grind it and that's what can assist in the binding of the binder I'm like the great explanation analysis. It is it is. You go. You bind it with the binder so it's um like distilled water I've got the other one. Ox skull um and yeah you mull it and it's the granulation is what they look for so when you mix in it is the granulation when you test it out. How smooth is it and yeah um I think Windsor and Newton's got the smoothest look okay. Okay. Product but then again it's all how you use it it's almost that camera theory you have an expensive camera but it doesn't mean you're gonna take great photos. Oh no I understand that I've got I gotta do camera to take um to do the videos for my tutorials and I feel like I'm I have no idea how to use it like I've looked up instructions and youtube videos and it's just like oh too many settings. I'm just doing it on my phone. It's just too many settings. Sorry so this is one of the learn my craft website um tutorials. Yes yeah so I'm I'm slowly going through this book currently and turning them into tutorials um so there's like new tutorials every week and mainly in color pencil and pastel because I know a lot of people um have been asking me how I use the pastel with the color pencil and I'm not really like a color pencil purist like I can do it with just pencil um but I do prefer the pastel because I think it just gives it another dimension of color and it makes the process a bit quicker so you can just do like because the tutorials are only about like an hour an hour and a half maximum yeah so again it's just like a quick little thing it's not like a 20 hour tutorial 18 hour tutorial of like you know a giant thing that you might never actually finish it's just like a little a little eye or a little nose and yeah um and I think it's a bit more helpful to have bite size learning I guess in that way because then people can who are busy um and just want to learn how I do a specific technique or how to do a specific like you know nose or eye they can just put the tutorial on and watch how I did it in an hour and then it's done so you know what I mean and then it's sort of I think yeah showing that you can do it in an hour it sort of gives you that okay when you're painting like don't spend your whole out not your eye whole out your whole day focusing on the nose this shouldn't be 100% a hmm total takeover like when do you call it quits on the nose when do you call it quits on any part and that's that's part of the learning I think yeah and you do get faster the more you practice I think if you're new to any medium even with color pencil I might take an hour but somebody else might take two hours and that's just because you're learning yeah um somebody might take only half an hour to get to the stage that I do in an hour so everybody's different and everybody has a different style and technique that might take them longer or a shorter amount of time that's the beauty of it isn't it so I just love the way that you use the pastels because it is almost like the way that I can use a wash like it's not using it as a the main focus but it's used as something to just um fluff it almost like it's a nice smooth coloring technique yeah it's sort of like I'm just coloring blocking in the colors coloring the paper so my pencils can just concentrate on everything else rather than just filling a block color I figure what I mean does it just take so long to do that yeah does that save the um do you think it saves your pencils a bit if that makes sense like I guess so I never really thought about that to be honest you've done that initial because I'm talking about like the sharpness doesn't yeah this is the longevity of your brushes no not your brushes my pencil was it definitely doesn't save like black and white because like this is my white I've ordered a new white it's coming this is my other white put me out of my misery these are my whites that I'm using right now so I hope the postman comes in the next few days to save me um but like so I guess it doesn't save certain colors that you use all the time yeah it just depends on the portrait as well oh my god my mother saved me help me you're cute aren't they oh they are cute those people are so this is really good paper that's a sharpness oh my goodness I do you get hand cramps won't be that small I do sometimes put them in the pencil extenders so here's my black in the pencil extender I didn't know that was my my black so I've got a touch view of these that is cool yeah why did I never not know about pencil extenders they're very good these are the derwent ones you can get two for eight pound seventy I think on jacksons for those in the UK um probably ghetto on amazon too but I like the derwent ones because they're like a soft grip they do get a bit muddy but they're a soft grip metal pencil the luminance pencil sort of fit in like it doesn't screw all the way down but you just need to screw it enough that it's not going to pop out as you're coloring so no these are really great if you if you need pencil extenders a cool invention it is do you have any like cool tools that you use with watercolor not really just I've got like brush cleaners that's really that's as exciting oh I love that that brand that's a good brush cleaner brand isn't it I really need it I call it like taking my girls to the salon so I really need a good sale for the trip hard working right last time I took them that sounds good last time I cleaned them was just after christmas when I went on the christmas break and I went yeah I'm going through my brushes a little bit too quickly you need to you need to go to the salon you need to have your hair done that's so funny I am terrible at cleaning brushes that's the thing about the good thing about pencils I don't have to clean anything I hate cleaning brushes it takes time but it's so therapeutic when there's like getting the points shaped and it's just something okay so you like it then I hate cleaning my makeup brushes and I just like that so I don't wear makeup anymore just you don't have to clean the brushes so I might have to clean brushes for work I have to clean it yeah I'm not I'm not doing it anywhere else yeah we've almost run out of time oh no I'm doing it a few more minutes I'd say so I'll get the black one so it looks more eyeball one oh it's looking so good I love these subtle color variations you've got in there it probably looks like an eyeball it's brushes I've got my new love of this brush it's 20 out of zero 20 zero so it's like I don't actually know how many hairs there are like I want to say three it really allows like in the most veiny sections to get those tiny whiskers oh that sounds very satisfying because there's nothing worse when you do a whisker and it oh especially brushes it's thick and I just ruined the whole artwork oh it's the same when I haven't sharpened my pencil enough and I go in to do a whisker and it's just a bit too thick and clunky looking as I go no you can use the blade I'm I love this whole blade thing I might have to cackinate using a watercolor to pack it on yeah I don't know I don't know if you can I don't know if it would ruin the paper or not you definitely have to wait till the paper's dry dry and I feel like you'd have to only work on black it's maybe there's a lot of pigment there's how much do you have to build up upon I find quite a lot actually to make a difference you know it's a breakage yeah otherwise it doesn't really do very much oh my biggest fear imagine like doing all that work and then be like scratching actually cuts through the artwork oh yeah oh no more like my mum would watch me jinx me and then the artwork should be done but I remember the first time I saw I think it was a Kirsty Patrick youtube video and she was using a knife so this was before sliced tall came out so this is a ceramic blade but she was using a Stanley knife which is a metal blade to do fine hairs and I thought oh my goodness I cannot do that I'm just so scared that I'm going to cut through my paper and then this tall came out and it's so much better because it's also rounded edge as well so it's not actually sharp and it's just yeah so it feels a bit more secure like I'm like it is sharp here like if you really pushed into your paper you could cut it but it's not like a metal Stanley knife blade yeah that that would be just scare me and yeah although I still want to try so when I scary things I still want to try yeah well that's what you can use this book for give it a go not to cut yeah especially through the book the year one up not cut through the book I will be making my time for the squares yeah now I quite like that I can cut up my own paper because then I can try out different papers because I got like a whole draw full of paper of like different brands and now I can finally like go through them and try them out and stick little squares in this book and then you can go I not do not recommend this paper this paper's good yeah do you write on the I'm like thinking almost passport like do you write on the back what paper you used or any other annotations I probably should but no at the moment I remember so but I'll probably forget at some point but the moment I remember it like I remember almost almost every name for every pet that I've drawn oh isn't that weird when you do that yeah and it's like I don't even know my own number and I can memorize 300 pet names I have it like I've got um you know doing a market people be passing me the cards and like oh you've given me Jimmy crumpet this is this and I just look at me like I've lost my mind because I'm just saying random names but I'm like oh no like turn around the car on all my cards I've got their own little oh you've got the names oh the sweet a little thing because last time I was like oh yeah my dog likes balls too my dog likes to run and snuggle up so it's quite nice and yeah when they pass it to me like oh you got blah blah blah they always look at me in river half okay and to like explain to them oh it's like when you flip it over you'll see it on the back acts with someone's pet and then they always get supplies so I'm always like why would I have all these pets lying around yeah I don't want to keep all these portraits I never actually realized I haven't done a proper count of how many portraits I've done painting for five years I don't want to know I feel like I'll be scared of the number you'll be shocked to like oh that's lower than I thought or that's higher than I thought have you done a lot more than a folder in my on my computer so all I did was just highlight all the pictures and it tells you how many how many things you've highlighted that's the only reason I know otherwise I wouldn't bother counting it's just too many how many scans because that's one thing I've started to do scanning in my artwork okay okay yeah it just changes because I was playing around with the light and it's always hard when you want to take a photo to give like before posting it off to just get that final check and the light just doesn't do it justice like I promise you it's not this dark or it's not this weird color I promise you it's better than this yeah and then it just doesn't allow you to do those small details of oh you want cards you want this definitely and it's your portfolio isn't it because you don't get to keep the real thing so I think it's so good to um scan in all of your artwork before you send it and then that's part of you know your portfolio of of pets and portraits and your examples and then you can do stuff with it later like you said with cards and things which you can't really do if it's not high quality enough yeah yeah that's one thing annoyingly scanning at high quality and the computer just goes no we're full now you're this is why this is why you need an external hard drive I've got a desktop one so that's got that's got my five terabytes of portraits and videos and pictures and yeah so if if anything happens to that desktop drive I'm screwed it's very useful to have it all there I saw that you did a look back of your um your prices did you have like a look up back of like when you really first started when you like wow I always think you know I really first started from the first time that I sold a piece of artwork yeah so that was you know basically my first one I'd say um so I think from there I'd say I was a professional artist even though I wasn't full time yet I was still like doing my PhD um I'd say from then that's when I started my portrait business without really even knowing it and that's when I started working for myself um so it's quite nice to look back and see how far I've come and how much I've learned as well from it you're like oh wow I thought I was good back then and what what a 360 like when people always ask me oh right say like at markets and you probably get oh I wish I could do painters good as you or drawers good as you it's like um I didn't wake up one day and painted this like this has been a lot of work and by the way I purchased this book so you can learn yeah I should stop plugging that in it's like something that you just wake up and you know yeah it's like it's like when people like are struggling like with their art businesses and like oh how do I go full time and you know I'm struggling to do it and you know I've I've learned how to do it which is why I know because I've put in the time and the effort to do online courses and read books and go to you know marketing things and then I did I my first book that I ever wrote called Artists My Career How to Start an Art Business was literally everything that I learned for like four years of being an artist so it's just it's slightly out of date on the social media front I'd say but everything else in it still applies um and it was literally everything that I learned so then when I started getting requests about you know oh can you help me do this and I don't know how to do this I just kept saying like I've I've literally written it all down for you colour coordinated it you know it got diagrammed everything it can't it can't be any better in the then like you know audiobook yeah it is an audiobook as well oh yeah it comes in every format that you need that's what the book is in Kindle, PDF, hardback, paperback, audiobook whatever you need that's what the book is in so if you want to grow start grow your commission mainly a commission art business it's all in there like it's just everything that I've done and still doing um and I'm very proud of that but it still sells every day on Amazon so oh that that'll just be nice just so yeah and it's amazing those people are like oh but like can't you just tell me something no like it's too long that's the problem like I would love to just tell people but then I need hours and hours to write it all down and then you know pages of Instagram messages which is hence the book because I have written it all down and people think it's just an easy an easy solution like oh yeah just do this this this and you'll you'll be amazing no it's the amount of hard work the trial the errors the the simple learnings that happen it's like how you deal with customers that don't pay I've learned that the hard way of making sure that customers have to pay a deposit before painting all right see and if you read my book before you started then you wouldn't have had to learn the hard way yeah because I've already learned the hard way and now I'm telling you what to do and what not to do so anyway I'm listening buy the book buy this book and take deposits yes definitely always take a deposit I personally always take full payment upfront because that's what my customers are happy to do so yeah that's I just need to get the confidence it's just confidence yeah it's all things that happen the more you do it yeah I'm three years behind you so hopefully three three years time how we're doing 100% deposits oh we should um probably stop now before Instagram cuts us off or something but oh it's looking so good and it's so beautiful thank you so much oh my I'm just going to look up at yours why I need a lot more layers it's a bit rough but
