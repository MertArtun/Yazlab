 Take a deep cleansing breath. I know, right. Like deep cleansing breaths. That's how we're going to start this podcast. Very demure. Right, very deep. Really? We're going to start with that. Yeah. Hey guys, it's lost. And this is the second episode of the Apple Sleep, another Apple Sleep experiment podcast. I am joined by a lovely group of people today and we're going to be coming together to talk about the art process. I'm kind of more of a moderator here this time. I'm not going to necessarily be because, well, your girl can't draw. So I didn't necessarily like help that much in that sense, but my lovely wife, Mag, she was the one who basically, well, you were the art director. You were the one in charge when it came to like the, how the art was distributed and everything. And we're going to go over those processes. We're going to talk to a few of the artists and yeah. So let's go down the list and let's introduce ourselves. So let's start with Cloud9. My name is Cloud9 or the life on Cloud9, if you want to be fancy. My pronouns are they, them, theirs. I was an artist for pretty much the entirety of another Apple Sleep experiment featured in all four episodes as me and my compadre over here recently discovered. So took part in a big deal of it. Yeah, that's pretty much me. I don't really have anything else exciting. So please move on. I'm paranoid. And then we have Callisto. Hi, I'm Callisto. I go by he, him and I have a cat viper. I love that. Cat facts. Then it's me, Magpie. She, her, or she? Or she, I just realized it's sound like the candy. I'm chocolate and my factoid is, I don't know. Oh, no. No. I was going to say your chocolate. That's your factoid. That's my factoid. The end. Next, Marci. Hi, I'm Marci. As Cloud said, I was in all four and didn't realize it until today. My pronouns are he, they. And I don't really have a factoid about myself. So. Marci, you have factoid, sir. My factoid is I have no brain today. And that is completely valid. We're going to try to get through this. We got this. It's fact. It is fact. It's fact. Yes, true. We have Nick. Yeah, my name is Nick. Mindless sketching. I go by mindless sketching or Nick or mindless Nick. It kind of depends what medium I'm on. But I use she, her pronouns. And I drove six hours. I might have been speeding. That's arbitrary. We don't know. But I drove six hours to be here. So very excited to get started. I think you win facts. Factoid. And then Sunny. Hello, my name is Sunny. My pronouns are he, him and she, her. I have done lots of art things for lots of people in the 10 plus years I've been in fandom. I've also done voice acting things. And today I am voice acting someone who is not sick. Yeah. Yay. And then lastly, but not leastly, but not leastly, Flutty Voices. Hello, I have Flutty Voices. I do voices and also art. And I just got over the COVID. Nothing can kill me, bitches. Let's go. Yay. Life is the best factoid. So the process of doing art for projects is a lost comes to me and says, I need art. And then I sit, I'm a computer for a moment, and I think to myself, can I do it all myself? And 99.9% of the time, I answer no. There is that 0.1% of the time that I take on too much, then my friends have to bail me out. Yes, art docs. Oh, I love and hate them both. They're great. They're horrible. I go into way too much detail, but I feel like that's a benefit for artists, in my opinion, I hope. Just basically, not only do I put the script of what it's based on, but I will give them character reference, background references. I'll give them the expression from the characters, the context surrounding the image that they don't have to read everything because reading sucks. How long are your art docs usually? This is not for Apple Sleep specifically, but I have a comparison. There was a project we were doing, and the script itself was about 14 to 15 pages, and the art doc ended up being 100 pages that did not include the reference pages. I hate it. But it makes everything so cohesive, and hopefully it makes people not worry about whether or not their art's going to match the next person. I'm a stickler for detail, so I always try to remember every nitpick little thing. And even then, I can't predict everything. And then based on the project, we will create a server with the artists. Sometimes we do, sometimes we don't. We did for this one because it was a very, very massive undertaking. And to be honest, it's one of my favorite parts of the production process is just hanging out with all the artists. I find that we lift each other up. And that's not always true for servers on Discord. But artists seem to really promote other artists or help whenever they can. Or just, I don't know, it's such a joy to go and see work in progress and stuff that isn't even for the project. One of my favorite things when I'm down is just scrolling through the show me what you're doing, show me what you're working on. I'm totally interested in all that. It's fun. How many artists in total did we have for this, for all the project? That would have been a fantastic number to realize before coming here. So let me find out. I glanced at the server. It looks like there's about 30-ish people in there right now. That sounds about right. I think the most on any project I've ever had was about 50. But I think for Apple Sleep, too, it was somewhere in the mid-30s. Yeah. A couple did not want to be a part of the server, and that's fine. Servers aren't for everybody. Reaching out to artists, I talked about this to Sunny literally the other day. I have such crippling anxiety when it comes to reaching out to people, because 99% of the time, I feel like they're so annoyed or bothered. Like, why would I want to go back and make more pony art for you? Like, there's just this inherent fear in my head of, like, I'm asking too much. I'm asking too much of people. They're going to be too busy. I'm bugging them. I'm annoying them. And it's almost never the case. Like, almost never. And even when they aren't available, it's always like, oh, but catch me next time. Or I enjoyed working with you in the past. You know, I'll totally watch it when it's done to support you that way. But my top priority as the art director is to make sure every single artist feels respected and appreciated. Like, as detailed as the art doc is, I also want their creative interpretation too. Like, there's a reason we go to so many different people. God, I love seeing all the different art styles. You know, there's a few that came to me, and they're like, well, I don't know if I can match show style. And I'm like, great, cool. That's what we're looking for. I love, some people call it the chaos of different styles, but I love it. And especially works well for a Grimdark series, because you never know what to expect. And every single person that was a part of this project put 10 times the amount of detail in each image than I was ever expecting. And it's just a treat. It really made the story come alive in a completely different way than even myself as the author anticipated. Because I don't remember if I said this in the first podcast episode or not. As I'm writing, I see it play out like a movie. And my fingers just try to keep up. So when I look at other people's interpretations of it visually, it's so much fun. I don't know. I have a blast with that. I try to make realistic deadlines with Wiggle Room, because for me, it's life always comes before pony art. And there's just sometimes where you can't make a deadline and you've got to have that little week or two extension. And I totally understand that. I always try to give artists. I would love to give them two months, but depending on how quickly we need it, I always give them a minimum of a month to get me an image. And so far, that's been pretty reasonable for most people. Because yeah, life happens. And I'm not going to be that person to be all upset with them if they don't get it done or whatever. And with some Wiggle Room, I can either tackle the image myself if they need to back out, which again, totally fine. Or I can have someone from the server help. Like I said, that server is a lifesaver in many aspects. I know that I had Marcy specifically bail me out for the first part of Appalachic Part 2. I was like, Marcy, I need an additional image for this thing. Will you do it? And he's like, yeah. I'm like, OK, thank god. How many images do you usually ask per scene? Obviously, we have a history with doing similar projects like this, like with Princess Trixie Sparkle and things on your channel. But with my channel, obviously, it's more of like, we use one image per scene. But there are instances where we get multiple images. So this is just based off my own opinions of the story and the piece. And it's not just because it's my writing. It's for any project I go into where I'm putting together an art doc. I look to see at what point does the conversation or the scene shift to where we would need to see something new, which for why in the first, in part one, a Sunny's image with Twilight seeing Applejack for the first time in the lab stays on the screen for as long as it does, because that's all the visual information you really needed for that stretch of time. There wasn't anything else technically going on that needed clarification visually. Plus, I would also say, too, the attention to detail on Sunny's image is like, I love doing slow panouts or slow zoom ins when there's lots of detail in the image. And I know we've been very, very blessed with a lot of the artists that we work with. That the detailing is fucking insane. Absolutely incredible. So for narrations and stuff like that, it's perfect. But in that same part one, there are three images in a very short amount of time, because the scene shifted. So we had Twilight outside of Starlight's room, and then Twilight crawling through with the broken wall, and then Twilight in the room. And that happened much quicker than different other segments of the story. So I just break it up depending on what do I think would be visually dynamic and not necessarily about every little thing has to be visually showcased. Because a lot of, I would say, half of the art of this project is art, and half of it is audio. And I want the audio to shine, too. I don't. PTS, just as a side note, because I know that's another one I'm known for doing big projects with, is a little bit different because it's not audio driven. It doesn't have a narrator. It doesn't have. It's all just dialogue. So images need to tell more of the story, whereas this is a narrative. And so the audio is supposed to be a companion to the art. So I wanted to go down the list and basically have everybody talk about their experiences on the project. There's a couple bullet points that I've already given everybody to. But for the most part, though, you guys are going to be hearing what it was like to work on the project and what was expected and things like that. So starting with Callisto. It was actually really wonderful to work on this project. It was an experience that I was very happy to have, and I'm grateful for it. My art appeared in all the episodes except for episode 2. I was, sadly, absent for that one. I was going to say, you had a really, really big part in episode 3. I do remember 3 having so much Callisto art. It was amazing. Especially when AJ pops out of her cocoon. I don't know how to fucking describe it. I like the interpretation of the monster from Callisto. Yeah, though, when it was first transforming. Yeah. That was so good. I use megabang. It's a digital software. OK, cool. I've never even heard of that one. I was going to say, I haven't heard that one, too. So you use tablet then, huh? Yes, ma'am. Is it possible to have a piece that you both hate and love? Yes. Yes, it is. I have plenty of fanfics that that is the case. Y'all remember the piece where I finally got to do some bloody artwork with Apple Bloom? Yes. Yes. So that one was a pain to do. I loved it. I loved the outcome. But when I was first doing the sketch work, the layout of the room kind of messed with me. I think it was my dyslexia because I wasn't reading it right. But it took me forever to get it right, in my opinion. But I still love it. Everybody always mentions the little cameo of Lost and Me in the corner of that image. It's so cheerful amidst all the death. It's great. See, no, my favorite piece isn't even a piece that ended up in the reading. It was that shitpost art that you drew of Twilight's back all like you like drawn shitpost art. Tis a bitch. Tis a bitch. Tis a bitch. It was just like, yeah, that's that's the whole vibe. That's the vibe. I mean, when we all found out about ending, I guess it didn't really affect it as much. I mean, I guess the only one would have to be the sculpture painting where I had to know all the faces and who had died. I was sad about I can't remember his name. He's the white Pegasus with the yellow main dying because I was like, oh, no, not him. Was it both biceps? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that was. Well, luckily, I'm not one to get easily upset because there was actually nothing that made me upset about this community. It was just wonderful and I really have nothing negative to say. Yay. From an art perspective, it was fun because it challenged me. I've never done a lot of background pieces like that before. So it was very fun from a fan expected. It was like having an anime moment right there because I'm like, oh, crap, I'm working with two big YouTubers. So terrifying and happy. It's not too excited. You're a good company for terrifying. You're good. I'm just very glad to be here. So that's about it. Yay. Yay. Was close to the one that did the most artwork pieces. We have that written down. Hold on. Yeah, we have a doc for that one moment. Let's find the doc. Yes, Callisto did the most. That's what I thought. Nine pieces. I was going to say because that's what I thought. Yeah. So no, thank you again for that. I mean that. This statement is from Spen Charlie. Firstly, I never thought I would be part of such a big project. It was an honor as an artist and a great experience. I also learned a lot. I will continue to try and improve my art style and look forward to future collaborations. Thank you, Lost and Mag. I appear in all four. I believe I did have to double check on that as well. So Marcia and I are in the same boat currently and that boat has multiple holes in its sinking. I did appear in all four. I did a piece for like the the intro. Like I guess build up like before shit goes down in episode one of Twilight handing out checklists of all the shit for the main six to do. And then episode two, I was Pinkie Pie focused. Episode three, I did one for RD and one for Rarity. And then episode four with the big reveal. That was I think that was the most I contributed to to episode four. So yeah, pretty much in all four episodes for me. I am mostly digital. I do try to sketch sometimes on paper just to get a rough feel for things. I I remember there was one banner of the fallen that I designed for Mag that I just crudely threw together on paper. But I am 90 to 95% digital on Procreate, actually the mobile program on a tablet. I liked everything that I did for this pretty much. I say I think the ones that were my favorite were actually for the last episode. Episode four with Apple. Have we I'm sorry, have we given a spoiler warning for this? Am I allowed to talk about the ending? Fuck it, it's been a year. If they haven't seen it, it's their fault. You have to watch it by now. What are you doing? What are you doing? Why are you here? Why are you here? Anyways, like, yeah, you should go watch the fucking sequel. All right. Well, yeah. So yeah, my favorites, I think, were actually in the last episode with the reveal of Apple Bloom. I had the most fun kind of like putting that one together. It was the most like, I think, attention to detail I've put into a piece in a while. So really enjoyed that one. Episode three with Rarity specifically was another artistic challenge for me, but it ended up being fun. I got to write bloody messages on walls, so that's always fun and a great time. I think the one that maybe like, I don't want to say it got under my skin the most, but I think the one I had to like take a step back from and like ask for other people's thoughts on the most I think was episode two, because I had to draw a burning building. My part was when Sugarcube Corner gets burned to the ground and all Pinky can do is watch. So that one, trying to draw a building on fire and then the interior where AJ is still in the building. So she's in a building that's burning, but not actually burning herself. Trying to figure that one out. Yeah, that one I say I do say I had to take a step back a couple times and reach out to people and being like, am I doing this right? So I think that one maybe was took the longest, I would say. I really, really liked the piece that was in part one with the sticky note. That was that was that was like perfection for me. I was telling Meg, I my logic behind that was because I actually reached out to Meg and I was like, hey, so my scene takes place in the throne room. Starlight's now the element of honesty. And they're trying to erase like all evidence of AJ, like pretty much existing, it seems like. So would they make any effort to like cover up that cutie mark on the seat, like on her throne? And my thought behind it, because Meg was like, yeah, sure, like it would probably be covered up in some capacity. My brain's like, OK, they're going to try to erase it and get rid of it and pretend it's not there, but they're not going to think too hard about it. They just want to cover it up and forget about it. So they're just going to hastily like, oh, yeah, we're just going to sticky note some shit on top of it with Starlight's cutie mark and call it a day. So we don't have to think about it anymore. That was my logic behind that. And I'm glad it worked out. We we we were snuck into some drafts. We were privy to some early drafts over here. We weren't given away a ton, like right out the gate, obviously. But we did get some early, like little teasers here and there and bouncing ideas back and forth. So a lot of it wasn't like for me, at least too surprising when it came out the gate for everyone else. But it was fun to see everyone else's reactions. Can confirm that is one of the best parts. I I love community aspects of any sort of project. Like I love being in servers. I love seeing like everyone else's work that gets put into it. I always love bouncing off of other artists and kind of seeing what they're doing. So I just I love it. I've been in projects like this many a year at this point. So it's it's always fun to see. I always love like the community aspect. People coming together to make some awesome shit. It's great. It's a great tag line. People come together to make some awesome shit. Let's make awesome shit, y'all. I only have one word for it, and it's good. It was so gentle, too. Good, good, good. The following statement is from FlutterPaws. Working on AASE was a fantastic experience overall. I got the opportunity to work on this project during a time when I was struggling to find any momentum to draw. Accepting the offer helped break me out of the I don't know what to draw, so I won't draw at all cycle. Honestly, I fangirled a little bit being able to work with Mag on this project. Aw. Plus, I've always been a fan of psychological horror, so this was right up my alley. It was also a fun challenge to fit all my ideas into a single image. It really tested my art block and let me have a nice amount of creative liberty. Overall, creating art for this project helped me remember to enjoy the process and not just set any heavy expectations on yourself when creating. Because it might just turn out better than you expected. So thank you both. So I'm in all four segments, much to my surprise. Do you remember what scenes or like stuff like that? I'm not gonna lie to you. I cannot remember the exact segments. But I know for episode one, I was kind of near the beginning. No, no, maybe towards the middle. I really don't know. I'm so sorry. No, no, you're fine. I was middle leading, so you're good. Yeah. So for AppleSuite specifically, I only used like a tablet for Procreate. But funnily enough, so I right now I have my own. But at the time, I was actually using Cloud's tablet to draw everything. So it was really interesting trying to find time to trade off the tablet for each of us to do our segments. Mom said it's my turn with the iPad. Yeah. All right. Let me tell you a little thing about bricks. So there was two, just to start out, there are two segments that I really enjoyed. One of them was actually, as Mag referred to it as her rescue piece, where she forgot to put in a segment for art. And so I came in the first episode and did it for her and it's Twilight in her room. So I really liked that one. And then there was another one I really liked with Pinkie Pie and Applejack in Sugarcube Corner. I just really love the detail and stuff on that one. But the thing that got under my skin is for my first segment, I decided, let's draw Twilight walking up to like her basement door. And obviously it's in a castle basement, so there's all your bricks for you. And I was like, OK, well, I can do that. I can individually shade all these bricks. And so after that segment was done, I messaged in the server and said, I am never drawing another brick ever again. Well, episode four, I am like, oh, I'm going to jump on this. I'm going to be one of the first to pick a segment. And I picked my segment and I was like, OK, it's Apple Bloom breaking Applejack out of prison, basically. And they're running away from the guards. And I'm like, OK, they're going to be running through Canterlot. And I was convinced they were running through a Canterlot street. And I went, you know what? I should probably message Mag. Are they running through Canterlot or somewhere else? And Mag was like, no, they are in a dungeon, a brick dungeon. He made the biggest deal in the Discord server about his hatred for bricks from part one. So to have you pick the only image in part four with bricks, the only one. Literally the only one. It was literally so it was like, OK, I'm going to I thought they were running through Canterlot and then Mag was like, no, they're in a dungeon. They're in a brick dungeon. And I went, OK, let's let's do this. And yeah, I I drew about 100 more bricks and four full body poses. On top of that. And yeah, I never ever want to look at another fucking brick again. Such a good story, though. It's one of my favorites. I remember the watch party and everyone being like, so about the bricks. So as mentioned with cloud, I believe I'm not sure if cloud and I were together the first time we talked about it. I think I remember just Mag and I talking about it when I was over one time. And I before I think it was even before you guys were writing it yet. You were like, we have this idea and you guys you guys laid it out for me. The end plot twist and everything. And I was like, oh, like this sounds interesting. So I did know don't think it affected my art that much. The thing that affected my art the most was I was like, is there an official design for Applejack? And I remember lost specifically saying, no, we want there to be a discrepancy because of the plot twist, because it's in everyone's it's everyone's different depictions in their mind. That was one of my favorite things about with reading the comments with each of the episodes, because everyone was like, why does he look different here? What the hell's going on? And then they would all speculate. And a lot of people got it right. A lot of people were like, yeah, they're they're on the shit. We know what the fuck. But like, that was the lovely thing about the artwork. Like the thing that everybody used to point out, especially like with other audio dramas was like, oh, the artworks are all different. I hate it. I remember I would see fuckloads of comments like that. And I looked at Mag and I remember when we were trying to figure out those ideas, I was like, no, I want to fucking utilize it and twist it on its head because now people are thinking, oh, is that a 10? Like I'm using it. I'm exploiting it at that point, I guess on some level. And like just looking at Marcy's pieces, the one in the kitchen with Pinkie Pie, AJ's eyes are almost completely blackened. And yet in the very next scene, it talks about AJ's eyes being red and glowing. And I didn't give direction to Marcy to blacken the eyes there. But that was a really nice little thing of like, why are her eyes so different visually? Yeah. Yeah. I just that that affected my art the most was the no, there's not an official design for Applejack go hog wild with it. Like even in my Applejack in different segments, like if she was in another segment that I did, she purposely looked different because I was like, oh, well, if that's the case, then I'm going to mess around with it in each of my different art pieces. Because I just remember lost looking at me and going, no, have fun with it. Yeah. So I loved the group chat. I remember like I swear there wasn't a single day that we didn't talk in it, whether it'd be about a project about the project about something else. I feel like we were all, you know, we all like fit in the same pod, if that makes sense. We were all talking and really happy about it. Any voice channel that we had was super nice. Everyone was super nice. And then I remember after the project was over, I think I think it was Calypso. I can't remember who messaged and said, are we deleting this server? Or can we please keep this server? Because like we all we all loved it so much. I know that that made my heart melt too. I was like, oh, my goodness. I really loved working on this project. I always love Mag's art documents, not even going to lie. Like I love her art docs. They're so easy to navigate. Thank you. You can get literally you can go right to your segment. They it explains it really well. But there's still a point where you have that artistic freedom. And I love I love it when creators give artists a little bit of freedom. So funnily enough, I did used to watch all like these like the grimdarks and things like that growing up. But I kind of fell out of it. It wasn't until I met Cloud that I got back into it. So I had not seen the first one until I met Cloud. So working on it was like I wasn't like huge geeking out about it because I didn't I didn't really know what it was until like a year or two prior. So I just think it was fun. This statement is by Bella Pink Savage. I had a great time drawing for this production. When Magpie asked me if I wanted to partake, I was immediately on board. But only if I could have a scene with no gore in it. As I'm used to drawing ponies being cute and doing wholesome stuff. And I usually get freaked out by the sight of too much blood or viscera. So naturally, I ended up testing my limits, LOL. I don't know why, but I decided to draw a little outside of my comfort zone. I mean, a little blood on Rarity's forehead didn't sound too bad. But the longer I worked on the Rarity and Twilight pictures, the more detail I wanted to add. I'm so proud how they came out. I'm so happy I stepped out of my comfort zone. It was a great learning experience. I can't thank you enough, Mag, for the opportunity. I'm looking forward to drawing more fucked up ponies in the future. Yeah, so I was in episodes one, three and four. In episode one, I got to have the real fun part of ending the episode where Starlight dies. And we, you know, Twilight gets bonked out by a known figure, which we learn later. And then in episode three, I had two different parts. I had the scene where the syringe is thrown through the window and Rarity is reacting to it during the dark and stormy night. And then I also had the scene later on where her and Applejack are fighting for the scissors to try and, you know, outbrew each other and stuff like that. And then in the final episode, I had the scene where start to have a resolution and Apple Bloom is called outside by the Royal Guards and she's kind of just explaining to them, you know, what's going on. So basically all of my artwork is digital from the beginning to the end. I do all of my artwork basically on Photoshop. That's what I've always kind of used, kind of my bread and butter. And for my specific tablet, I have used the same Wacom Intuos that I've had since I started drawing like 10 years ago. And she's on her last legs, but she's the old reliable. So, you know, I can't trade her out. Hell no. That's a mood. Yeah. So I think for my favorite piece, it's a toss up between my piece I did for the first episode where Twilight finds Starlight and she's bleeding out on the floor. And the image I did where Applejack and Barrity are fighting for the scissors in both for different reasons. One of the things I just like about sort of Halloween projects in general is not the tangent, but my style is generally a little bit more on the clean side. And so I really enjoy these sorts of projects because it kind of lets me experiment and expand on my style in ways that I usually just don't get the opportunity to. And that's sort of ways I experimented, I guess, with both pieces. So in the first one, experimented with some different shading methods where Starlight is bleeding and Twilight is holding her as, you know, she's taking her final breaths and stuff like that. And composition wise, I think it's also just one of my favorites with the lighting and the shadows. And then for the second image with Applejack and Barrity where they're fighting and Applejack is sort of overpowering her. I really sort of experimented with that one. It was in a rush and I guess it worked in my favor because I used a lot less of a clean lining style for that image. And I think it really just added to the overall ruggedness and sort of just the mood and the atmosphere that is already being conveyed through the voice acting and stuff like that. And so I was really happy with how that turned out, especially once I saw it with the final product and knowing that I have those abilities to make something that still looks like my style, but also expounding upon that and something that's a little bit more rugged, a little bit not as clean, not as precise. And then I guess the only not trouble thing that sort of infuriated me was in the last image I did for episode four, I just the wheelchair. I I hate drawing wheels. So enough said. See, one of the things I've always I that I really liked about your artwork in the specifically the for the rarity scene, both of the the angles that you used, they were very, very pronounced and dramatic for both of the images that you did for the syringe, her looking at the syringe and then AJ like, yeah, overpowering her. And I just loved that. Yeah, it's not angles and perspectives that you typically see. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think for that one of the I always try to sort of make my images a little bit more cinematic and a little bit more interesting. I always like to, you know, try and play with like rule of thirds and perspective. And you know, what's important to the audience versus what do I know as the artist, what do I want you to focus on versus what do you think you're supposed to focus on? And so I always try to I guess I don't say make them boring, but one of the things I've really been trying to experiment with my art the last few years is different angles, different perspectives. And I think that it looks cool, but it also just has helped me grow as an artist as well. So I didn't know about any of the plot twists really. I'm going to be honest, going into this project, I knew I wanted to help, but a lot of the times for a lot of projects I'm in, I also want to experience it as a viewer as much as possible. So I try to gather as much information as I need to holistically complete whatever my portion of the project is in a way that's effective and conveys the information it needs to. But also I don't like to be spoiled and I like to view the content I'm creating and all the content that other people are creating when it's all put together. And so I'm going to be honest, most of the time, whoever I'm working with, I say give me something and then I just focus on that. So I didn't know about, I didn't know about any of the plot twists. I'm thoroughly impressed with that. It's actually kind of a not common, but if I've a few artists have said that they want to enjoy the ride. And so they I was going to say your art docs are really good at facilitating that because they realistically only have to look at their segment and there's enough information there that they could technically get away with not getting spoiled. Yeah. And I'm actually thoroughly impressed with that. Because like I with the attention to detail that you put into your art, I would have not known that. Yeah. I mean, sometimes if I'm unsure about something, I'll, you know, confirm with Mag or you, hey, did the person before me or after me, if it's something that needs to be continuous in a continuity, uh, in a chronological standpoint, I'll ask without getting as much information as possible, like, Hey, do I need to know this or do I not need to know this? Or does it not matter what does matter? So that way it also doesn't break your atmosphere as a viewer. So I think as far as the community aspect, it went really smoothly. It was really nice to be able to have access to all the documents in one place. That was well organized and community wise with having access to everybody else in the project in a respectful way. If you have a question, you can always ask it and there's always going to be an answer, which I always think is really helpful, especially for, I know there's some newer people on this project and I know that there are a lot of questions asked. And so I think creating a really solid community, which you guys have, you guys usually do really is sort of the foundation for how smoothly things go. But I think that's a big aspect of it is you guys make things really easy and you create a space where people know they can ask questions of other people and of yourselves and that really sort of facilitates how smoothly things run. Oh my gosh, does that mean we've run good projects, Mag? I got apparently apparently apparently. It's projects like these where I really sort of get to step out of my comfort zone and in a good way. I think as an artist, you always need to be stepping outside of what you're comfortable in in order to get better. I think that's with a lot of things, but especially with art. And I don't think there's any harm in trying new media or anything like that. I think that's really how, I mean, that's how styles change and grow, but like, that's how we sort of become who we are as artists. And so it's always just like, I can say, for example, like there are things from this project that I didn't used to do before. And then I experimented with it and then now it's part of my actual style in a cleaner method. But like I wouldn't have, maybe I would have done it, but maybe I wouldn't have if I never did artwork for a project like this, where, like I said, it's a little bit out of my comfort zone and not as clean and not as finished, I guess, is a good way to say it. From a fan perspective, though, it is always just, it's nice to see things, a not reimagined, but continued was a big fan of the original Apple sleep. And I know a lot of people were as well. And I also just think from maybe this is a little bit from an artist's perspective, but especially for people who return or I think having a similar project to something a person has done in the past has really, really provides a method for you as a viewer to see how far they have come as a writer, as an artist, as an editor, as whatever. And so I think the other thing was that there was a lot of people in this project who I've known for a while and who I've worked with for a while. And whenever everything just comes together, it's really cool just to see how everybody has changed and improved and really grown. I agree. Yeah. 100 percent. Can I eat my McDonald's now? Yes, yes, you fucking can. I believe that in. Oh, my God. I mean, it's it's one of the more valid extra thoughts, you know, I mean, it is it is the thought that is going through my head right now as my food is staring at me. The following statement is from Corva Bug. My name is Corva Bug, formerly known as Fokie Yacht or K-90 Studios. And I adore this project and had so much fun being a part of such a spooky tale. I love how mind bending the end reveal was finding out the mare behind all of the chaos was very interesting to me. The little clues to things not being what they seemed were another thing I adored. I love how we made AJ seem like some unstoppable force. You never know what truly happened until the end. I wish we had pushed the mind breaking and twisting a bit more like showing glimpses of the other's point of view or flickering into reality and hallucinations. However, I cannot complain with the end product. This project made me jump out of my comfort zone and push my art so much more. I am blessed to have worked on such a production. Everybody did such an incredible job and all of them are the most talented and inspiring people I have ever met. I hope they are all proud of what they have accomplished. All the work they have poured into this is incredible. This project really changed how I looked at my art and pushed my skills. I can look at what I had done in this project and how much it has affected my art now. I'm incredibly blessed to have been a part of this with so many amazing people. Next time I'll for sure push my creepiness more or maybe keep things cutesy and fun. See you next time. Sincerely, Raven. So I did the first look that we get of Applejack in part one. I did the scene of Rarity when she's got her back on the floor and she's kind of bloodied up with the scissors next to her. And then and that was in part three. And then I did two scenes in part four, apparently, because I am in the crew of people who I actually rewatched the entirety of Apple Sleep Part Two in preparation for this podcast and got jump-scared by my own art in part four because I forgot that I did two scenes. I knew I did the part where twilight's like wandering around the orchard being scared of trees. But I also did the part where Ditsy is bringing all of the packages back to Apple Bloom at the castle. And I was like, aha, what? So I use in terms of hardware, I use a desktop computer and a Wacom. I think it's Nintendo's pro. It's very old and very janky. In terms of program, I use Clip Studio Paint and I do it all in Clip Studio Paint. Yay, a clip friend. That's what I used. My wings clipped. So my favorite is the first shot of Applejack just because I experimented a lot with I've always loved doing rendered backgrounds that don't rely on line work and characters that have a little bit of line work in them. Getting to experiment with that was great. And I like how it came out overall. That was the first time I really got a feel for sort of how I do my style now. So that was neat. You are an integral part of my current artistic style. I love hearing shit like that, to be honest. When I hear that like from something like one of our projects that an artist was able to like evolve or like find a new thing that they like about their art, like I like that's that's all I really want to do with these sorts of productions is help inspire others to help create their own stuff. Yeah, yeah, I think working with the time constraint and you guys do set reasonable time limits for the art. That definitely helps push me to like cut corners in a way where I'm still happy with the final product. So that was definitely the case with that picture. I was a little I wouldn't say frustrated, but I pushed myself a little too hard with part four where I was already going through some RL stuff. And I desperately wanted to like multiple pictures of that scene with Twilight and the old orchard because I thought it would look cool to have like different interlacing pictures of her like disoriented and just wandering around with all these creepy looking trees. And there's actually some some background elements. I think if you squint, I I'm not sure how visible they are in the final products, but where you can see ponies like on the trees, like hanging or or with a shovel in them like they were in part one. Dude, are you serious? Uh huh. Yeah. Oh my god, I just found some. Hold on. I know now like now I'm going to go back and look at the fucking art. Hold on. I didn't know that. Fuck like those pieces with Twilight losing her fucking shit. They were they were some of my favorites because it was just like what's obvious we don't like Twilight in this. Like just no. No, I love her. No, really? No. But like just the the emotional anguish, like you're so good with facial expressions and just the way like it's just conveyed in the insanity and stuff like that. It's like fucking just amazing. Oh, thanks. Stop. Yeah. But the picture with Ditsy on the steps that it wasn't firmly established in the little blurb, the guide blurb that it was Ditsy. I just made it because she's the the the TM Ponyville male pony. You're god damn right. Fuck it. Yeah. Hell yeah. There's one pure wholesome untouched character in the entirety of Apple's sleep. She is so precious that it takes you out of the story because you just want to. Oh, you're like, we needed a pallet cleanser. OK, just a brief just to make the horror push that much harder. Just one cute little Ditsy face. Right. Oh my god. Yeah, but all those fucking presents, though, that was a struggle. Presence were my bricks. I wound up just like copy pasting and morphing and color shifting them. So I didn't have to deal with it. And the angle was so hard. It's it's very much, but I think it worked out OK. No, it looks you would never be able to tell. It looks great. Thank you. A little bit. I can't remember if Mac would like come to me to talk to them or if we would just get talking and then it'd be like, oh, hey, well, I were talking, you know, what did you think of this scene or how is this reading so far? I remember we had a conversation about OK, something is obviously going on. Like there is a reveal here. What do you think the reveal is? I didn't I didn't guess that it would be Apple Bloom, who the culprit was. I wasn't sure if Applejack was actually involved or not. But I definitely knew that there were parts where she either wasn't there or everyone was just super messed up or something. I think that did play a little bit into how I did my scenes, but not too much, just because, you know, you're trying to keep it a surprise. I would read ahead in the docks as well to everyone else's scenes, because Mac is very good about having blurbs that are very detailed. And I think that's actually a positive because it means that I don't really have to think too hard about OK, what details am I missing? You know, I don't have to scrub through the entire talk. I never do a thing and make sure that it's cohesive. But I did do that just so that I wouldn't accidentally contradict something that was happening later on, or if I needed to, I could foreshadow something as well. So I did join the group chat. I'm very much the kind of artist working on these projects where you give me the deadline, I pick my part, I disappear from the face of the planet. And then a couple days before the deadline here, here's your art. And then I run away. But I did pop into the group chat every now and then. And it was it was very fun seeing everybody like uplift each other's art and people were really struggling with their whips sometimes and just the feedback that everyone was giving and how cool everyone was being. It was it was a definite good in the project to have that group chat. And the energy was great. Projects like these are a big part of why I'm still in the fandom, because I love seeing so many different people with so many varied talents come together and make something great. And I think you guys were right on the money when you said that the disjointed art styles work especially for horror because it keeps you guessing and you don't know what the next scene is going to look like. And that lack of consistency is like an underlaying, not anxiety, but extra little spice, little salt on the experience. I especially love how the editing guys were talking earlier about how certain images can linger longer because they convey all you needed to. You also do a lot with the editing that helps convey action scenes, even on a static image. And I think it was really cool to see that play out that. I bring it's not even that my brain's just like, I could give you a 20 minute spiel as to why like a certain thing was like the end of everything for me mentally. But that's why it's its own podcast. Yeah, that's why. Yeah, that's why the editing and the production is literally it's on podcast because it's going to be an hour of me just pitching. But no, but that's that's the one thing I do love about getting artwork from like you guys and like other collaborators that I've worked with over the years, because like it's the fact that a lot of the people that I've worked with, like you guys help us either pro bono or for like very little. And because of that, I when it comes to the artwork, I try to always honor it. And if there's a way to amplify it within the editing, like in like how you said, with the like movements or like glitches or like weird things to really amp up and bring up the best parts of that artwork. That's what I try to do because like the project wouldn't be nearly as successful. If not for your guys's art, it wouldn't. I can tell you that right now. Yeah, that's it. It would not be where it is, if not for the art. And that's why like, you know, the art credits are like the biggest aneurysms that I freaking have because and man can tell you, I fucking will sit here for hours and like meticulously go over the art credits because I'm like, did I spell this person's name right? Is it on the is there art on the screen long enough, Mag? Do I need to extend it? It doesn't help that I have a problem spelling things correctly. Oh, my God, don't even give me a start. Two writers, everyone. Two writers. But yeah, no, I mean, I think that's that's a good thing, too. Is like, Mag was talking about how great it is to see her writing come alive in the art. The same thing is for the editing. It's like a positive feedback loop of Mag writes the scene and then, oh, my God, look at this art. It's like the movie I saw in my head and then I give you the art and it's like, oh, my God, look at what you did with the art. That's amazing. Exactly. You give me life to this thing I've been staring at for three days. Yeah, I mean, this is also part of why I watch projects like these, even when I'm not involved, is just seeing that community effort and that love for what everyone is doing and appreciation for each other. It's really great. There are two lines I want to highlight. It's it's not necessarily art related, but just because I was really listening to it, the part where Pinkie Pie is listing all of the cupcake flavors in one of them is blue. I live for that blue flavor lover representation. Pinkie Pie is such a personal place, too. But yeah, and then the other line was when Rarity and Applejack are facing each other down and Rarity is thinking about her dad and then thinking about the syringe and Applejack asks, lose something. Oh, my God, the heart punch, though. Excellent. Very excellent. You guys, you guys are great writers. You're great at everything. It's it's always wonderful working with you. Emotions. This statement is by Danny's Art Den. Working on Apple Sleep was a blast. It allowed me to get out of a depressive slump. I knew I would love working with Magpie and Lost. They had been a pleasure to work with before from previous projects like Angel of Mercy and Princess Trixie Sparkle. Getting to draw cute, colorful characters, getting violently torn apart is very therapeutic after a day of working retail. Mag and Lost have been absolute sweethearts. I haven't had directors that were so vocally appreciative of artwork like I had never been praised so much for my work than I have working for Mag and Lost. Seriously, they are hella sweet. They actually care if we are sick mentally or physically. They kept communication open and friendly. Sweeties, Nuff said. Thank you, Danny. The following statement is from the artist Urban Kool. Kool, I hope I said that right. I probably didn't. Hello, hello. This is Urban Kool in text form because talking is scary. Magpie wanted my two cents on working as an artist on another Apple Sleep experiment. So here are my quick thoughts and feels. The original Apple Sleep experiment was one of the first MLP audio drama projects I ever assisted with. I've always loved listening to fanfics from the Lost narrator and Magpie Pony while I draw. So it was beyond exciting to contribute to them. Naturally, when Mag poked me about the sequel, I was super hyped to join in. It felt like all the work I've done for them was coming full circle by revisiting the Apple Sleep universe. I love seeing how it all came together and how hard everyone worked on the project. From the voice acting to the editing and the art, it just feels like a big love letter to everyone's journeys as creatives. Doing art for them has genuinely helped me improve so much and pushed me to come out of my shell. It gave me the confidence I needed to pursue my dream career as a freelance illustrator and start my own projects. Though I'm probably always going to be a social anxious hermit. I just want to say that I love and appreciate the fuck out of Lost Mag for everything. Oh, thank you for picking me to be an artist all that time ago and keeping me around to draw edgy horses for you guys. So I was in part two, three and four. I was only at nine and one because I was not made privy to this magpie. Listen, you were real busy helping with other things. Actually, yeah, I'm almost positive. The reason why we didn't pull you for the first one is because you were working on the merch for debt. Was it debt to society? The merch? You were out busy. You were literally doing everything else. Hey, I'm still a fan. I will bend over backwards for your guys's story. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Mostly digital with the what? What am I saying? Completely digital. They use paint tool side with the Wake Up tablet. That's my go to. Oh, goodness. Which ones didn't I? I think my my two favorite ones are the Fluttershy fighting off her own animals and rarity getting ready to stab a bitch. That fluttershy. That Fluttershy image, bloody. That Fluttershy image with the fucking animals and just her fucking raging. Oh, it's so good. My personal favorite of yours, this is a side side thing is. Did I say personal favorite? Did I say that right? Um, it's the apple bloom with the evil like pyramid fingers, apple bloom. In part four, it's great. Oh, yeah, she had to have her fill and reveal moment. She had to be like, oh, yes. Absolutely. I've seen a lot of artwork mimicking that or fan art mimicking that pose where she's got her hand her hooves together and like diabolicalness. It's been it's phenomenal. I can't word it's phenomenal. But a picture being like Bane like, and so I will kill you, Twilight. Yes. I want to go on record. I knew I knew apple bloom was alive. I knew it. Never said that to that mental life. And also, yes, it affected some of the art because I knew Fluttershy was losing her shit. So I'm like, well, let's make this as abstract as possible. And then same with like when Rarity's facing off with Applejack. Mostly when Applejack's first breaking in, try to have little abstractness and, of course, Rainbow Dash's panic attack here and little Tannock pick. Rainbow. Yeah, you. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, you drew that one too. Where rainbow's losing her shit. Everyone here had contributed a lot, which is why we were so happy to have you here. And there are a lot of artists that did, you know, like one or two pieces. But you guys and a couple others specifically really gave it your all. And I just can't thank you enough. He he you deserve it. Thank you for letting us be a part of it. It's so fun. Again, from the fan perspective, getting to see all the art coming through and it could also like help feel like inspiration for my own pieces, be like, oh, this looks so cool. I want to try like get that level to stuff. It never good as everyone else's, but it all looks so cool to see. It's funny how like a server based around murder horses and stuff is what some of the most wholesome people. So true. Art perspective, I loved it. I I do always feel spoiled with magpie's art docs because I can I know I can just scroll right to my segment and everything I need right there. I'm like, yeah, I don't have to like read back on other docs. Not that anyone has to, but it is nice to just be spoiled to be like, bring me the references. Yeah, I get real particular. I really do. It is very nice. It lets me turn off my brain and just go creative mode. And of course, as a fan, absolutely love these stories. It's what fuels the creativity of art. I I always think art fuels more art. So whether that's the story writing or the voice acting or, of course, the 2D artwork, it's always so amazing to see. Yeah, that's that's the one cool thing. I think we've we've talked about it a few times already, but like the it's like it's artwork building upon more artwork building upon art, more artwork and there everybody has different genres that we're creating them in, but they're all blending together very, very well. And I would say beautifully, too, because of like the production aspects and stuff like that. Brangle Burr. Yeah, me. A plus. A plus. Yes. That's how we're in there. That's how we're in there. The statement is from Safina. Hello, my name is Safina. Getting to be an artist on another Apple sleep experiment was a massive honor to me. An Apple sleep experiment was one of the first MLP grimdarks I ever really watched after Tale of the Lost narrator. So after working on so many other projects for Lost in Mag, along with other creators, having the opportunity presented to me to work on another Apple sleep experiment was amazing. I actually begged to be included during a call while watching the premiere of an episode of Princess Trixie Sparkle 2 when they first announced AASE was in the works. Once I was accepted into the project, I got the chance to read over the parts of the script before the videos were posted. And I was over the moon with the story that was being told. Mag is a fantastic author and I was excited to get to be a part of this and work with both Lost in Mag. Having worked on so many grimdarks at this point, I always loved the challenge of getting an assignment of making something creative within the bounds of a story, making an art piece that helps to tell the story itself. Mag and Lost have been so kind in that regard. Not once when something needed changing, did I ever feel I was being spoken down to or not being respected for my work. Quite the opposite. Apologies and thanks were always plentiful when a correction needs to be made. Another aspect that has fascinated me is the editing. How our works as artists that already say so much are brought to life in the videos themselves. I'm always excited to see the final product of the work everyone puts in. Overall, AASE is one of the projects that I had the most fun working on. Up there with Friendship is Tragic by Scribbler and Princess Trixie Sparkle 2 by MagPypony. I've made so many friends and working with other artists always helps me to improve my skills by seeing what I love in their art, which is a lot because all of these people are crazy talented and trying to incorporate it into my own styles. Thank you Lost and Mag for this amazing opportunity. And I look forward to working with you both on PTS, Immortal Fliction and any projects that come after. It's really important that I do this, but I will get emotional. So don't make fun of me. Talking to you, Lost. You know, no promises. I want to say this to all of you and to all of the artists who are not here with us in this moment that I'm honored. God, OK, sorry. I'm honored that you would give me us these hours and sometimes days of your time. I talked about this a little bit in the first podcast, but this story I wrote largely on my own. I didn't really have editors this time around. It was me and there was a sense of fear going into the art aspect that people weren't going to be jibing with it. I poured a lot of myself into this, both knowingly and annoyingly. So to have such amazingly talented people be willing and almost happy, not almost, but happy to help bring a vision from my brain to life is overwhelming, which is why I have such a hard time sometimes asking for help because it's like I don't always feel worthy. I don't always feel worthy of all of your talent and all of your friendship. That server was a friendship for me. It was it was a really fun place to go where I felt I felt like I belonged. It's not a secret to Lost, but I have often said to her, I don't consider myself an artist. I don't consider myself up to the same level as the wonderful people who collaborate with me and each and every single one of you brought so much love to this silly horror story with pastel colored ponies that it blows me away and it makes looking back on the project and rewatching it again. It just makes it all the more unmemorable and positive. Like, I mean, we even found out details in images just from this podcast. I didn't realize for there, you know, everything is like a new experience every time. And I know there were ups and downs, but you guys really are the best. You were some of my best friends. And some of the best people I know. And I just want to thank you. And I want to thank the viewers, too, because if not for you and if not for your love for the original Apple sleep, none of this would have even been a thing. I wouldn't have been able to really bear my soul creatively in the medium that you wouldn't expect from me. But yeah, I just I'm honored every single day to be MagPyPony and to know all of you. And that's all I want to say. All right, I'm going to have to give you snuggles when we're done. Ha, honey. Oh, you were the cats, you know. Yeah, maybe both. I know. And on that note, I think that is it. So thank you all for listening. I want to thank all the artists, like like how Meg was saying earlier. The biggest reason why these productions are even able to be as good as they are is because of you guys. And I just I yeah, I'm forever grateful for this. It blows my mind that so much talent is is willing to help us make these visions come to life. And it's it just it blows my mind every day. But yes, let's let's go down the list for a while. Is everybody crying? Did I not have everybody say goodbye? It's going to be like, bye. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just this means the world to me. So I feel you know, I got you. I held it together. I'll go. Go. Bye. Bye.
