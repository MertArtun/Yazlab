 Hello and welcome to a special podcast about an extraordinary time. My name is Ros Taylor and I'll be talking to some of the people who helped transform early childhood education in Eastern and Central Europe, starting in the 1990s, how they did it and what they learned. We'll be discussing a new book, Early Childhood Education in Social and Political Transitions, which takes an in-depth look at the groundbreaking step-by-step programme. Joining me is one of the authors, Sarah Klaus, who is one of the leaders of this Open Society Foundations programme and is now affiliated with Georgetown University's Centre for Child and Human Development. Hello Sarah. Hi. Along with Iveta Silova, Associate Dean of Global Engagement at Arizona State University. Hi Iveta. Hello and it's great to be here. Thanks for having us. And also with us is Carmen Lika, Director of the Step-by-Step Centre for Education and Professional Development in Romania. Hello Carmen. Hello everybody. Thank you. It's a great pleasure to be here. Let's begin at the beginning. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, George Soros decided to make a major investment in early childhood education, probably the biggest ever. That was the step-by-step programme funded by the Open Society Foundations. Sarah, what did he hope to achieve? At that time, across the region in Central Eastern Europe, the Open Society Foundations had a network of independent foundations established in almost every country. And the aim of these foundations really was to hasten the transformation to vibrant, open democratic societies. George Soros always invested heavily in education programmes and at the time that this programme was established, he was actually interested in starting a university. He was convinced by Dr Fraser Mustard, who ran a social science institute in Canada, that he actually really needed to be investing in young children in order to really transform these societies. There was incredible brain research coming out at the time and he was very convinced by that and made a commitment to invest $100 million in the step-by-step programme. Come in, early childhood education was very different in Eastern Central Europe and Eurasia at that time. Give us a sense of what it was like to be a pupil in those classrooms, to be a small child in those classrooms. It really was different from what we did and what we accomplished with step-by-step. Although early childhood education was a very strong component of the education systems at that time across the Eastern Bloc, it had multiple functions and most of them were social functions. Basically, both the nurseries and the preschool programmes provided protection for children and the place for parents to leave their children. It was a way that the state freed the parents in order for both mothers and fathers to be able to work. They mostly provided healthcare and social protection, as I've already said, and not so many child development and learning opportunities. Also, it was a very, very big focus in getting the children ready to go to school. It was a very teacher-centred experience where the teachers were basically delivering some plans developed by the central authorities with no information and no attention paid to the individual children that they were working with and not so much understanding of how little children learn and what the child development means for learning and development. So it was about shaping the child to be well-behaved and a good citizen, but there was very little emphasis on the child's personal development. Yes, the individual child basically didn't exist. It was a model that all the children had to fit and had to accomplish. Step-by-step drew on the Head Start programme in the US. Sarah, tell us about that because you were heavily involved in it. Yes, at the time when Mr. Soros came back from his meeting in Canada, Liz Laurent at the Open Society Foundations was tasked with developing the Step-by-Step programme and she contacted colleagues that she had met at Georgetown University who were providing technical assistance to the Head Start programme. Now, Head Start turned out to be a fantastic model for the Step-by-Step programme. It's a programme that emerged as the national programme to support early childhood development under President Johnson as part of the War on Poverty. And it is a programme that supports holistic, child-centered, inclusive early childhood development. And it's a programme that provides the states with block grants to do that and allows them a lot of flexibility. So it was a great model for Step-by-Step which we were trying to implement initially in 15 countries and later in 30 countries. In the book, as we were doing the interviews, we asked one question that interested Jan very much was why we didn't pick one of the democratic pedagogies in Europe, of which there are many. But the Head Start programme, I think, was first of all accessible to the foundations. But it also had the capacity to do what we needed to do. We needed to start in 15 countries at once. We needed 30 trainers. And it also had a wonderful focus on social justice and inclusivity that really underpinned the programme. Yves, when you first began to work with Step-by-Step in Central Asia, what were some of the challenges you encountered? Well, Central Asia was a fascinating place. And I wanted to maybe, from the very beginning, just remind everybody that the whole area of the former Soviet Union, Eastern Central Europe is not one homogeneous blog, the socialist blog, as many people refer to. But it is a really, really diverse place and with very deep local histories and cultures and different political trajectories. And Central Asia was a really fascinating place to be in. But it also probably was one of the most difficult places to work in because the preschool or early childhood education infrastructure was already fairly modest compared to the other countries in the former socialist blog. But it completely collapsed after the Soviet Union collapsed. And maybe the reason, one of the reasons was because the early childhood infrastructure was really in large part supported by private industries. The enterprise owned kindergartens that were very popular. And during the transition period, the privatisation of industry really affected also this infrastructure of early childhood education because as enterprises began to be privatised, preschools were the first ones to be basically shed and sold off. The buildings would be sold off. And so that resulted in very devastating effects for families and for children. So that early childhood education infrastructure probably was the first one to collapse in this broader education sphere. And the teachers were leaving because the salaries were so low. And so it was quite a dire situation from the get go. But it also was a really fascinating place to work because on the other hand, there was also a major political will and the desire maybe more broadly among the public to bring back some of this infrastructure, right? That was so important. So that was, I would say that Central Asia maybe had more political will compared to other contexts to kind of engage with the step by step programmes, but also with other education transformation programmes and explore all of the possibilities that were on the table at that time. So it was both very dire situation, but also an exciting, the one with lots of exciting openings. So you found that education ministers were quite keen to help you in the end. Was that why? Because they were keen to build up this, the early childhood infrastructure that had been broken down? Absolutely. That was one of the reasons. I think another reason was because just the philosophy of the step by step also resonated very deeply with many people, both academics and politicians, who were brought up maybe only these more kind of philosophical ideas of bigotskis that they recognised almost immediately in a step by step programme as well, right? So I think there were some elements of the programme that resonated immediately and very deeply with academics, but also politicians in the region. And I think also, I must say that our colleagues in the different source foundations in Central Asia, but also beyond, were also so clever in how they were maybe presenting and introducing the programme to their colleagues in the ministries of education, you know, with regional authorities, because I think they also were able to maybe highlight the elements of the programmes that would speak to the people in power at that time. So this ability to connect maybe the key elements of the programme with the historical context, with some of the maybe philosophical ideas that would resonate. So I think step by step just had really amazing people that were able to make a lot of bridges and kind of lay the ground for successful implementation of the programme. In the book, there's a really vivid sense of the excitement and purpose around step by step, which you've you've just alluded to there. In the early days, Carmen, what was that like to be a part of? It was quite an adventure. I was a student and my colleague at that time was a dentist, so we were known as the student and the dentist when we first started. We, after the initial training that we participated at in the United States, we went to the Ministry of Education to inform them officially about the programme and the plans and the Ministry of Education was like, oh, a student comes to ruin the tradition. But I remember when we launched the programme and we signed the partnership with the Ministry of Education, because as Iveta has already mentioned, there were a lot of people who resonated with the principles and the values of the programme, although they understood that we need to reflect on the actual practices and change them. But I remember when we launched the programme to all the 48 county school inspectorates, we had inspectors calling in and saying that they will come to Bucharest to sleep on the doormate in front of our office door just to make sure that they will be part of the programme. And all the teachers in the first nine preschools who were so excited to learn more and to change the practices and what they were doing so that they could offer the children they were working with the best opportunities to learn and to reach their full potential. So it was a curiosity, a professional curiosity and desire to do more, to do better and to get the children ready for the life that was just opening in front of everybody. Tell us about some of the changes that the programme made in these settings. It changed the whole approach from the teacher-centred to the child-centred approach and that was a real, a huge challenge. Although we, let's say we use the same furniture, like the tables and the chairs mainly, the way we arranged it, the kind of training and support the professional community that we developed, the teachers learning that they learn every day from their partners and from their children and from the families, considering looking at the family as a partner and having the family involved in the classroom activities was like a wow moment for all the teachers who very, very quickly understood that the parents, the families have valuable information about the children and they can work together and it is better if they work together in order to support the children and it was the whole world they discovered, participated in training and having access to the methodologies that were developed and the depth to each national context. So I would really keep in mind the professional curiosity and desire to learn and change the lives of the children. Children with disabilities and Roma children were very much marginalised in the education systems in these countries. Sarah, give us a sense of how they were treated. There was a profound structural barriers for both groups of children to participate, even to participate, I won't even say to participate equally in education systems. So many, for example, many children with disabilities were kept at home or they were institutionalised, those that entered the education system were often segregated out into special schools and the whole field that was dealing with special education was referred to as defectology, just to give you an idea of the stigma and the way that children with differences were treated by the education system and in society. And for Roma children, I would say it's even just as profound if not more profound, but especially there was an enormous and remains an enormous amount of discrimination against Roma children across and here I would say not only Central Eastern Europe, but also Europe as a whole. And so I do want to emphasise that many countries in Europe were also around this time trying to figure out how to integrate and include Roma children and Traveller children, for example, in the United Kingdom, where I live now, into education systems. Roma children, many Roma children speak a different language at home and they would go to school when they were entering, they didn't have opportunities to participate in preschool education. So the number of Roma children participating in preschool education in the 1990s was very small. And when they would start to enroll in school in some countries, they were given entrance exams and the entrance exams were given in the majority language and they spoke a different language at home and so they would end up in special schools because of this bias testing or segregated into special schools or segregated into separate classrooms. Many children dropped out as well because of the discrimination that they experienced in schools. So it was really a dire situation. And just to emphasise some of the countries that step by step was working in Romania, where Carmen is, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, these are countries with very high numbers for high percentages of Roma people. So having them not participate in education is hugely detrimental to the whole society. Carmen, how did step by step try to change all this? It was introduced as an inclusive program from the very beginning, from its very first day to the Ministry of Education, to the county school inspectorates who are basically the local authorities, to all the teachers and parents that we worked with. We understood very quickly that the early childhood is the best entry point to reduce the differences, to recognise and reduce the differences in approaching Roma and children with disabilities. As Sara mentioned, children with disabilities were not even considered to be enrolled in regular classrooms. They were either kept at home or enrolled in special classrooms. So we made it very clear that we open enrolments for all children with partner with social services in the first nine cities we started, and that was a practice that continued. So children with different vulnerabilities were enrolled in the step by step program while we supported the teachers with training and working with children that come from different cultural backgrounds, children with disabilities, and we also offered them on-site support, like coaching besides the training. The training focused on the democratic values such as inclusion and tolerance and diversity and recognising the differences and understanding that it is okay to be different. For young children, it was natural to have different colleagues to work, to play with different kinds of children, and it became natural for parents. And this is how we kind of built a critical mass of people, both professionals and families, and social services that rolled on and moved forward with this idea. And we came to a point where the Ministry of Education used to refer parents of children with disabilities to go to step by step classrooms because this is where they will get the best opportunities for their children. Of course, there were setbacks. Not everything changed as much as you wanted it to, as quickly as you wanted it to. Sarah, how did you handle that? I would say that this was a program of persistence and learning in the fall after the first trainings took place over the summer, when U.S. trainers went back to visit programs in Central Eastern Europe. Everybody was excited. It was just a huge change in all the classrooms, but they started to notice that teachers were still asking children who were left-handed to write with their right hand, or children were still standing in line to go to the toilet. They weren't really being treated as individuals. And we realized that there were still a lot of things to do. So a new methodology, a whole new training package, was created and delivered to support teachers to think about these nuances of democratic education that maybe we hadn't thought about at first. But also in terms of working with children with disabilities and Roma children, over the years, the program really collaborated, for example, with UNICEF and the Roma Education Fund, when we realized that the changes weren't happening fast enough to create reports and document what was happening, or to work with a number of organizations across Europe to really advocate for changes. I would say that we weren't able to change everything that we wanted to change, but we never stopped trying. We had a saying, who says we can't change the world? And that was sort of the motto that the whole program lived by with this expectation somehow that an education program in early childhood could make a huge difference. And step by step eventually moved out of preschools and primary schools, and it sought to influence in-service training and pre-service training in universities and training colleges. Sarah, how did those institutions, which had often been doing the same thing for a long time, react to that? So we included representatives from the universities in all of the trainings from the beginning, but only in small numbers. And we realized after a few years that that wasn't going to change the university system and wasn't going to change how teachers were trained. It wasn't going to change what we call the in-service training system, which is how teachers get participate in retraining. And in the region, it was often every three or four years they would participate in a retraining program. So we started a higher education program, part of the persistence program, and developed eight semester-length courses for universities and then provided those courses through trainings to about 2,000 people in the across universities and pedagogic institutes and in-service training institutes. And here I would say I think it inspired individual professionals to change their courses. In a few universities, we know that it inspired a particular certificate program or a change in the training program, but it didn't have the huge effects that we wanted. And I think in retrospect, maybe we could have focused on specific institutions of higher education and focused on training those. But I do think it kind of changed and introduced some new ideas into the academics of early childhood education as a whole. And I think that that has served as a foundation for other work going forward. And in the end, you moved far beyond Europe and Eurasia, didn't you? Yeah, the program at Open Society Foundations actually ended up as a global program working around the world. And the step-by-step program was one project that was influential in some of our activities. I think in the book we write about the work of the Open Society Foundations in Bhutan and also in Liberia. I would just say that what we learned was that the program was hugely influential or had had relevance even in contexts where the education system was very different. I should mention also that the program was operated from the early years in Haiti and for a time also in South Africa where Open Society Foundations had and still I think has national foundations. This book is a reflection on step-by-step what it did achieve, what it didn't. Looking back, Ivetta, what might have been done differently? This is a huge question and probably another book could be written just about this question alone. But I wanted to pick up maybe on the question, on the discussion that Sarah just started a little bit earlier about the pre-service and in-service teacher education in schools. So I think this perhaps could be one area that could have been done, could have been approached differently, right? But as Sarah said, it was a major learning process for the program itself. But I wanted to point out that this was a problem that was very typical for most of the international development projects at that time. So many resources in the early 1990s and beyond went into schools to really offer direct support to teachers and students and offer this very direct immediate assistance on the ground. And higher education institutions really became an afterthought in a lot of international development assistance programs, right? So they actually were perceived by many people as these black holes where nobody wanted to invest any money because nobody would know what would happen with this money and these huge bureaucracies. But in a way, I think that international development assistance kind of replicated maybe some of the also problems that we have in Western Europe and North America, or kind of like Western education more broadly, which is really based on this research to practice divide, right? So kind of this logic maybe was automatically transferred also to international development contexts, right? Where the kind of schools and preschools were separated from what was happening in terms of research or in terms of teacher education programs. And I think when people started to not only in step by step, but in many other programs, started to realize that, oh, schools are changing so fast. But pre-service teacher training institutions are producing exactly the same teachers as they were 50 years ago. I think this is when this maybe realization became more pronounced and also the urge to address it became more urgent. But I wonder what would have happened if from the very beginning, right, the teachers and researchers and faculty members in high education institutions work together and owned the program and the transformation together as a collective. I wonder if things would have been different. And I think that it was a really unique moment in time because everything seemed to have been thrown up in the air in the early 1990s when, you know, so many institutions were collapsing. So I think it was a really unique opportunity to try something different, but we didn't, but we did it later, right? And so I think there were lots of, as Sarah mentioned earlier, opportunities to learn and also, you know, opportunities for these Western experts who were part of the program to learn how programs could be done differently, including at home, right, in the United States or in Europe. So I think it was a good learning experience for everybody involved, both people in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, but also all of the colleagues from the West as well. So it was mutual, wasn't just one way. Exactly. Carmen, you run an NGO which was established through the step-by-step program. What was your experience of setting it up? That was a learning and growth experience. We had a change in management of the National Soros Foundation in late 1997. And when the new management team came in, they called me and they said you have like about three months to put together an NGO. I didn't have experience in running NGOs, developing NGOs. So I put together a team of people and we had to go through a legislation that dated at that time from 1924 in Romania. That was how the civil society organizations were legally organized. And we started early 1998. Probably the biggest challenge throughout the whole process was to keep expanding the step-by-step program and maintaining the high quality of the program while developing the NGO and building a strategy for the NGO as a whole, not only for the program. And that was one of the biggest challenges. I am very grateful for all the support that we received from the early childhood program with all the training and the coaches and the mentors and the resources and also from the National Foundation. I think it was a learning opportunity for everybody. And where is step-by-step in Romania now? It's an NGO celebrating 25 years of existence and 30 years of step-by-step. In 1994 we started with the preschool program. In 1995 we were amongst the few ones who said yes to the parents who wanted their children to continue in step-by-step program and we started with one classroom of primary school program. And the number of groups of preschool classrooms and primary school classrooms has grown steadily ever since. We are now active in 600 kindergarten nationwide and over 1,000 primary school classrooms. We also adapted the step-by-step principles and values to public schools who wanted to transform themselves in step-by-step schools. We are also working with the first five big universities in Romania in developing a course on alternative education. Step-by-step program is officially recognized in Romania since 1995 as an educational alternative. And we are also working with the National Association of the Pedagogical High Schools, which are the institutions who train the educational professionals for nurseries. So this is in a nutshell where step-by-step is now in Romania. It's everywhere in other words, almost everywhere. And we also, I think we were very, very involved in advocating and designing the legislation for early childhood in Romania. Eveta, you mentioned earlier this is a step-by-step is a remarkable example of East-West policy borrowing. What did you personally learn from it? So step-by-step is a really fascinating case study. So for anybody who's interested in comparative education, I think this would be a really interesting case to explore by reading the book, which has so many excerpts from interviews with different stakeholders that were involved. It was like actually listening to a lot of familiar voices to me when I was reading. So it's a really, really great case study. But I think that, and there are many lessons that could be learned from it, but for me personally, let me step back for a second. So policy borrowing and lending is often critiquing this pre-packaged education reforms that are transferred from the West to the East or North to the South. But I think this case of step-by-step program is really interesting where the reform has been transferred, but it has been extremely adaptable and like on an ongoing basis adapting to the local context, right? Changing in response to the concerns or the interests of the local stakeholders and communities, right? So much more, I would say, open, ended and reflective program that kept learning as it was going, as Sarah mentioned also earlier, and Carmen as well. I think also what it program showed is that this borrowing process is not one way transfer, right? But it's an ongoing mutual learning process where both the so-called quote-unquote experts and the local stakeholders learn together and create something new in the process. But I think maybe one of the kind of most interesting lessons to me was how this program created really dense networks of academics and practitioners, not only regionally, but also like on a worldwide scale, right? So now we have, you can actually see collaborations that are happening across the four socialist regions. You can see collaborations that are happening worldwide. It really actually ended up changing the culture of education and created these absolutely powerful networks that exist now and that, you know, continue to advocate for policy changes, for even broader cultural changes in the context where they're working. Sarah, Open Society has stopped funding step by step, but the programs left an indelible mark on the countries that took part, as well as on Europe and Eurasia as a whole. Do you still see the step by step imprint there? Oh, like 100%. I mean, I think one of the big achievements of the program was developing or supporting the development of a vibrant civil society in early childhood education and development. And you can see that in organizations like the organization that Carmen leads, but also step by step sort of gave birth to the International Step by Step Association, which started out just focusing on the step by step NGOs, but has expanded across all of Europe, West and South and North, as well as across central, you know, it's always included programs from Central Eastern Europe. And it's really become the go-to professional association in the field and is advocating and sort of holding on to the values that underpinned and underpinned the step by step program when it was established in 1993, 1994. As we were doing the interviews for the book, you know, in so many countries, it's not only that the program itself is still approved as a program in preschools and primary schools, but also in a quieter way, the program has really been one of the positive influencers of policies and practices at higher education institutes, but more of policy changes of curriculum, of standards. And so we see elements of the program woven in. And I think these networks also helped knit together East and West Europe in a sort of early childhood education academic sense. I think that's also been a really important part of the program. And I think also one that shows how Eastern Europe can lead in bringing those academic and practitioner communities together, which is not always seen. I think, as Ivette was mentioning, we also often see this idea of Western Europe coming and doing things with Eastern Europe. But this was an example of Eastern Europe taking an initiative and really seeing it through to create something for all of Europe and Eurasia. It's been a fascinating and really quite inspirational discussion. Thank you so much to all of you. Ivette. Thank you so much. Carmen. Thank you very much. And Sarah. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Without an ME. Thanks for listening. I'm Ros Taylor.
