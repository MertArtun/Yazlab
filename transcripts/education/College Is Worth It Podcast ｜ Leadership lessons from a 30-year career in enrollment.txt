 You're listening to the College's worth at Podcast. Learn from leaders who are transforming higher education to ensure that a college degree will pay off for this generation and the next by exploring innovations and education with us in each episode. And now you're host, V-new in. Hey everyone, this is V and you're listening to the College's worth at Podcast. Today, Jonathan Shores, who has a long career in higher education enrollment, and is currently the Senior Vice President of Klein Services at our Dayo Education Solutions, will be interviewing his longtime colleague, Roger Kiefer. Rogers career in higher education spans 37 years, including 30 years of enrollment leadership. He also served a role as Vice President of Klein Services at our dayo alongside Jonathan. Rogers also found her in President of a firm books on executive coaching and leadership development. So he has a lot of expertise in higher education in leadership and sort of the intermingling of both. Jonathan and Roger in this podcast will exchange their knowledge of enrollment development and discuss what it means to be a leader in the enrollment space day. So let's get to it. Well, thank you so much for that introduction, V. As mentioned, my name is Jonathan Shores, and I'm so excited to have Roger Kiefer with us here today. I have had the pleasure of knowing Roger now for a gosh Roger. I guess it's been about about six years that we have known each other. I think if it members serves me correctly, we first met at a NatCAP conference at John Brown University. I think it was probably in 2016. So it's been a couple years. I remember meeting you and thinking to myself at that moment. I've got almost 20 years of experience and this guy makes me look like a rookie. So I am super excited to talk with you today and just glean a little bit of what you've learned in the industry. If memory serves me, I guess we're getting close to 45 years. Is that sound right? Yeah, I was actually in the industry. I was working at an institution for 37 years and now I've been kind of still connected through our dayo and through consulting. So yeah, it's been close to 45 years now. Eight years retired. So what is that? 45 years. That's a long time. I wonder what I feel so. Oh, I get this. That's great. Well, with that, you did did a little bit of it. Can you tell us a little bit about your background Roger kind of where where you started. Tell us what you're what you're working on and what you what you've done in the past if you don't mind. Yeah, yeah, I like I said 37 years on on campuses 30 of those were in enrollment management. I served at four different institution. The longest service was the last place where I served at Trinity International University in Chicago land area. I started at L'Eternal University my alma mater all probably talk a little bit more about that as as we go, but. But I retired from Trinity in 2014, eight years ago. I retired early. I at least I felt like it was early. And I really had an eye toward doing some consulting. I was really interested in doing leadership development executive coaching and that sort of thing. I got some certifications and some training and was excited to kind of extend my career away actually away from higher ed and and do some of that, but as it turned out. There's a big need or wasn't he still is a need actually for enrollment consulting and so that kind of dominated my opportunities that I had after. After that early retirement, so I did quite a bit of enrollment consulting. I added part time role with our day, as you know, we got to be. Collings and good friends as a result of that and. And so I added that in 2017 three years after I have retired from from Trinity. So and and now actually every tire twice because as you know Jonathan, they actually threw a retirement party for me at our day, and so I'm now. I'm now kind of retired but kind of not I'm still kind of doing a few things with our day out. And and then other than enjoying the country living in little Tennessee and spending as much time as I can with my great kids. I kind of think about it as having four professional or still in the water or. Iron still in the fire, however, you want to put it one of those is still working in a reduced role, but still working some part time for our day out still doing a little bit of enrollment consulting. I usually limited to to at the most clients at at a given time. And so I'm just reduced that the amount of work I'm doing in in consulting. And all of these things I greatly enjoy and that's why I keep on doing and plus plus it keeps me kind of in the in higher education space. I'm also doing a mentoring a leadership development program for that cap you mentioned that we had met at an at cap conference, I'm still involved with them. And and what I do with them is. His help as a mentor in a leadership development program for young enrollment professionals really enjoying that and then I serve on the board of my alma mater, the turn of university. So I kind of get to see things from the other side of the table at board meetings, which is kind of interesting and enjoyable and fulfilling for me so so but still got some more in the in the water and doing some things to keep me connected to higher ed. Well, I will say we will keep you here at our day as long as you as long as you want to I think. Speaker, everybody up and down we we love having you on the team, but I will also say that if that's what retirement looks like I'm not sure I want to retire. So like you do have a lot of irons in the fire, that's for sure. Only because I enjoy. Yeah, there you go, there you go. Well, you mentioned the turn of and how you still serve on the board there today. Thank you, at least from a higher ed perspective, that's probably a good place to start probably where your higher ed journey started if you will. The amount of walking us through your your personal educational journey. And then kind of how that went, what you know, you already talked about the fact you attend a return of. But how did you find yourself there, walk us through that story. Yeah, that's that's an interesting story. I was born and raised in Pennsylvania and for those that don't know, what turn is actually in long be Texas along way from Pennsylvania back in the 70 early 70s when I graduated from high school. It probably wasn't that normal to go that far away from home, at least not for country boy like me from from middle from central Pennsylvania. But my my dad had met the founder of the internal university, our G, maternal who actually is a relatively famous industrialist who had over 400 patents in his career. And so so did a lot of speaking and my dad actually bumped into him and heard and speaking with very intrigued by his life story. And then found out that he had founded this, I was actually a fledgling school at the time it didn't start till 1946 it was opened in 1990 right at the tail end of World War II. But but anyhow. So he got me interested in it and and while I was. Not as I didn't know that much about our general internal or about industrialists or about inventions or anything like that and kind of it felt like an adventure to go from Pennsylvania to Texas to go to school. So I think maybe I'll take him up on that if he's willing to help me attend look turtle university so back then it was maternal college. And mostly known for engineering and aviation and technical programs and that is not what I ended up in obviously but but but I absolutely never regretted that decision it was one of the best decisions I ever made was to go to the maternal. And so I went on from there to give my master's degree at the university of Wyoming one of my mentors at the maternal. Was a Wyoming grad had his got his PhD at Wyoming and he was in the habit of. I was actually with my wrestling coach and and was. And so I was one of his athletes and he he was in the habit of recommending at his athletes and students. For fellowships or assistantships at the university of Wyoming's master's program in physical education so. So that's what got me to the university of Wyoming I did a little bit of doctoral work at the University of Arkansas. So that's my educational journey. And then you all if memory serves me correctly you went back to a turnover after that right it might write on that. Yes, my first job out of a graduate school was to go back and coach. I was on the faculty for physical education and I did that for seven years and and then. I just to tell you how I got into enrollment management you might be interested in that and listen to my. And that but. Yeah, at the end of that seven years I asked for a leave of absence of maternal. To to work on a doctor will be free and I was granted that and as I said earlier I chose the University of Arkansas's education program and I was kind of at a crossroads. I keep coaching that was still a possibility and I was very impressed with the baseball program at Arkansas in the coach there and I thought like well maybe I'd get a chance to be mentored by a guy like. Like Norm DeBrine and so any I was one reason I went to Arkansas. I was also toying with the idea of an academic career in in exercise science and. And so that was part of my studies at the master's level and and interestingly when I got had my exit interview with the academic dean of the internal thick berry he. And so I made the comment he said you know we we will guarantee you a job when we give a leave of absence will guarantee you that will hire you back which can't guarantee you it'll be in the position that you're in. And we're going to have to fill that position when you're gone and so we can't we don't know what what will be open but one thing we've noticed about you and one reason we're willing to give you the. I leave of absence as you seem to have some administrative skills and so would you be interested in an administrative role of anything were open and I said sure so that was actually a third option that. That I that I actually added to my possibilities. It was a two year leave of absence after a year we had a young family after a year I got a call from what you're not offered me a position of. Associate dean of admissions and records was the was the title and and having a young family and struggling a little bit financially I thought well maybe I could finish the back. From from Longview, Texas I never did I don't regret it. It never made a big difference in my career but but I did that's how I got into enrollment management because admissions and records. While it included mostly records work in the beginning register with any year I was kind of named the chief. Admissions officer actually within a few months I was named the chief admissions. I think I think they thought here you watch he was a coach he's a recruiter so therefore he can run an admissions office. That's not necessarily the case. But that's how I got into enrollment management. It's not the kind of thing that when you're either 10 years old you're aspiring for being an enrollment management. You're always looking to be a baseball player. That's what I wanted to be. Yeah, I didn't roll my management. I wasn't my lap and I I've had a great career. That's that's an awesome story. I think of all the things that I've known about you and the history. I don't think I ever knew how how you started in in admissions that's a that's a great story. Kind of the the last thing so here here you got here you go Roger this and though we can we can help you in the family and better but it's admissions. Okay. I'll play. Oh, kind of a little bit of a side note there so the way I got it's because you're right nobody grows up wanting to to go in admissions right. In sixth grade I don't know if ever told you the story but in sixth grade. I had a we were learning like economics right and so everybody would bring in things to sell at school and we had like faith money to learn economic. And I I brought in chilly willy's right so right towards the end of summer like little I thought. And so I was selling those things like crazy but the guy next to me a friend of mine named Jordan his father was the Dean of admissions at Kataba College and he gave Jordan like all these pins and no pads. You know in little sweeties and all this stuff and and you know it's a sixth grade or you're enamored with colleges and so he was selling those things left and right and I thought that's that's what I want to do. I'm going to be able to you know give out pins and no pads and. Little I know it and it and it and it and tell a little bit more than that so. Oh my goodness well um so that's great you know talking about the education. Excess experiences and how they influenced your trajectory obviously when you started there at maternal and started in that position and quickly move to the the chief admissions officer enrollment officer. You obviously found a niche you you stay there you stuck there really for the the rest of your career right so. Was there any deviation out of that Roger in terms of the enrollment side or did you just stay all in enrollment. Yeah it's interesting to you ask that I was in and I was in enrollment reported to me the rest of the 30 years 30 plus years and our 30 right 30 years and I was in higher ed back. But there was one little detour while it included enrollment management it was broader than that. I went from maternal to King University I was King College back then I actually saw two institutions change from college to university which was. And interesting and was a part of both of those. And but after about six years at King I was asked by a colleague of mine to serve on a team of consultants to look at a situation that an institution that was in crisis it was bluefield college in Virginia. And so they were going through some really really tough times and so the board decided to bring in a team of consultants anyhow short short story is at the end of that consulting. Experience the board called me back and said they want to talk a little bit more about my part of the report and and they offered me a job. And they said you know we are really big trouble they had lost their entire senior leadership team except for the academic dean and he was going to retire in a year. And so they were in some pretty serious financial trouble those that are from the bluefield area will remember that. So I took them up on it I took a job as the chief operating officer to help them kind of put all the pieces back together at bluefield and enrollment reported to me but it was just one of many things that did and I learned. And that was that was one of the greatest learning experiences I ever had. But within a year they had put things back we had put things back together we had some some financing in place we pretty much rebuilt the president's cabinet. And they were about to hire a president and so King actually offered for me to come back at that point and I went back and served three more years at King. But but yeah that was the only kind of detour that that while it included enrollment and that was a very important part of what was going on there. Luckily the director of admissions was still there but all their cabinet level people including the entire financial aid officers lost all at one time. I was quite an experience I could I could spend an hour just talking about that experience but. But that was a little bit of a detour and I learned a lot and and I think it helped shape you know my my the rest of my career. But yeah so one year one year that wasn't directly a VP or in charge of just enrollment so. Yeah well and those 30 plus years that that you've been in the enrollment industry Roger what what have you seen as one of the biggest challenges you know like I think in my career right the set to me love it. You know overcoming students wanting to be closer to home and you know that that was certainly a bigger challenge as we look at discount rates that's been a bigger child what as you've seen. Well let's be honest enrollment management the term enrollment management really didn't exist then right it was more just the admissions. What's been one of the biggest changes you you've seen or you've faced and in your career. Yeah it's an interesting question that. In Roman man's move a brand new concept when I got into it in 1984 it actually developed in the 1970s and there were some. You know flagship universities that were using the team the term already I think it started at the University of Indiana but not the stake and that was the first institution to use the term. I remember people making predictions about how and Roman management as a career was going to be something that. I never would have dreamed of and most of the people that worked in enrollment management that I knew at early in my career would have never. I think that that that it would have the changes that it did and a lot of those predictions in fact I would say most of them came true. You know all the different fluctuations and birth rates and and graduation. Number of students graduated from high school and the challenges and the competition you know even the idea of adults adulthood education which was just a gleam in somebody's eye back in the 80s early 80s. University of Phoenix was just getting started and but even those kinds of predictions that we thought that I don't remember. And well you know a lot of the stuff that was predicted actually happened including the stature of the position of you know used to be dean of an of admissions or director of admissions and then it was you know like dean of enrollment management and then it was vice president for enrollment management and then there were senior vice president for enrollment. All of that stuff would like way off in the future yet back when I first started and and I ended up living all of that in my career you know moving into those positions and holding senior level positions which in the beginning that really wasn't. the norm for somebody that was working in admissions. So the but but I would say the biggest seed change that I saw happened. In the way that enrollment management needed the function and the way that families made their decisions actually happened during the 2008 recession. It wasn't a huge recession but if you remember it put a spotlight on on student debt and it put a spotlight on the cost of higher education. Because of student debt it's actually one of the things that made me think that our rap was one of the best ideas since life spread and when I heard about that I said that's exactly. The way we ought to be tackling this is you because so much of the information that's out there in the media is actually. Hiked up it's not really the way things are and people fear student debt much more than they ought to. But that had a profound effect on me at Trinity and it had a profound effect on a lot of especially small private colleges. And it was a big issue that I think that's the biggest challenge in the biggest seed change that I saw that you're right 2011 made a difference. There were some other things that happened but that's the one that stuck with me as well as a big change. And you didn't know in the head I vividly remember that and how that became part of the national rhetoric right of what's discussed and is the cost of college out of control. You know and that's obviously you know something that we're passionate about but it is it that part hasn't gone away right it seems like every election cycle it it kind of. Rears it's ugly head and I think you know it's it's important for us as a nation to look at that and address it but it certainly something that to your point I think it's an unfounded fear for a lot of the majority I won't say all but the majority of students and families that that are out there so. You talked about the birth rate I mean that that's something that it seems like in 2025 we're we're going to be getting back there with this demographic apocalypse if you will. You know as as you think back to your. Your career early on as a young professional and you think to these young professionals it always seems like. The industry the career is constantly young right things like the old regime if you will. You know it's changed out every so often what what would what advice would you give to younger professionals right now is kind of a. Hey here's a yield time that's coming up this may be something that you know in your career that you may want to look look at or maybe. You know proceed with caution type type situation. Yeah I think about that question a lot just simply because of the mentoring and the coaching that I've done in the last several years and so I'm always thinking about okay they're going to be. Ask the me questions but what do I want to volunteer to them based on you know my own experience in career so I actually think about that what do I wish I had been exposed to. Or told or. Recommended to me when I was when I was just starting out and and use the first what the pops into my mind and I think it took me a lot to learn this. I think that's the reason why I'm going to be a person of of the enrollment results a year institution is and and so the way I put it is. Is when you're enrollment is up better than what everybody expected don't take all the credit. Because you're going to be tempted to you're going to be tempted to accept all of those accolades that that the president and the board and faculty and everybody are going to want to say all you're doing such a great job be careful about. About doing that because there are so many other factors that affected that success rather than just you and even you and your team and there's a lot as you know and I mean there's just so many factors that it's. And now the converse that is when it's down. A whole lot less than what everybody expected don't take all the blame resistant and and yet early in my career I think I did both. I I was just puffing my chest out when thinking we're looking really good and then I'm thinking the world is falling apart. I'm the one to blame if the enrollment is down. And while there might be pieces of that that we need to accept the responsibility and even some of the credit when things are up it's just one small piece and that's the message that I think enrollment leaders young enrollment leaders need to discipline themselves. To present that message they yeah okay thank you I appreciate that okay let's go have lunch let's have a pizza party whatever we want to do but let's keep in mind here that this is not. This is not solely because of us in how well we recruited I think we did a great job don't get me wrong but there's a whole lot of factors and then actually have that list of things that you think went right. As opposed to just simply absorbing all the credit and the same thing with the blame. So that was my first thing yeah I think from a leadership standpoint that thing I wish I had known more about was self awareness and yeah I just. I remember the first time I ever took any kind of a self awareness instrument is called the wording in the president of the journal wanted everybody to take it. And I was kind of interested to see what it would say and it felt like somebody got inside of me and looked at me and do all my secrets about what would go through my mind and how I was wired as person. And I thought how valuable that is and for me to be able to communicate that to the people that I work next to or that work that work that reports to me or that I report to. I just became such a valuable thing to me so I wish I had known that earlier. I think that could have helped me through some real rough spots early in my career and then I think I learned some about some blind spots that I had and I wish I had known them earlier. Blind spots that you know. I don't have a blind spot about about seeking results. I don't have a blind spot about processes. I know how what to do and how you know what the steps are to get there. Some people have blind spots on those things. My blind spot is on how things are going to affect people. And so I need people around me to keep reminding me about how people are affected by the decisions I made by the actions that I take. And it's a understanding what my blind spots are. And helping people understand what their blind spots are when they're early in their career because I think you can really step in a lot if you don't really understand. So it's kind of related to that self-awareness thing. And then the last thing I'll mention because it's something I usually also include in my coaching is that. You can't do it all and most of the people that end up in a leadership role in the role in our people who've been pretty successful at some level at something. And and they believe they can do a lot of stuff and I would have been one of those people. But you can't do it all and when are you going to learn to trust other people to do important things. That need to get done and and so we call it delegation. But often by what we mean by delegation is is giving them something to do and then giving him detailed instructions about how I would. And and one of the lessons I needed to learn was to trust people just give them a goal and turn them loose and you can't do it. You got it you got to be able to trust people to do to do good work and the more I learned that the more successful I was. And it's great advice and as you've you built teams Roger right I mean you're your own teams that you had at your respective institutions. You worked with other other other organizations other companies other colleges to help them. Bill teams what you know to that to that point and maybe that is the point but is there anything else you can see is common. And then you want to give them a bit of a to put calls that maybe a leader can you know try to avoid or maybe focus on to build the right. Teams that that you know to complex whatever goal they're trying to. Yeah I mean what one basic thing is to understand that when you're in a leadership role that's what's were called to do. I think what happens is people get from, I'm a prime example. I mean, I like I said earlier. I mean, they thought, hey, here's a guy that was a pretty good coach. He recruited pretty well. Maybe he can run in the missions off as well. Just because you have the technical expertise to do something well doesn't mean that you can oversee people to do that thing that you were good. And yet most people get promoted because of their technical abilities and not with much of a regard for their ability to manage other people, to lead other people, to motivate other people, as you say, to build teams. Now, Brandon, having been a coach, I had some experience of building teams as well. But I do think that a lot of people that I run into that are kind of new in a leadership role, even if they're experienced in sales or experienced in some aspect of work that makes them a good candidate to be an admissions professional. But they're plopped into a leadership role and they, and what they don't understand is just because you are a good recruiter or a good salesperson doesn't necessarily mean that you can lead people to do that or manage people. That's a whole different skill set hiring people, but right people, that's one of the skills that it took me, you know, I'm still not sure I'm very good at it. So, of course, I think we all have our kids, wings and this is on on hiring, but anyhow, I think it's just, I think it's that, I think the thing that I try to get people to understand is this, this is a new thing now you're in a leadership role and here's what that means. But I think, you know, one of the things I appreciate and what you just said is you know, sometimes you you're not sure you still figure it out, right? I think that's critical for us as human and us as leaders to realize that we're not perfect and I think there've been times at least in my career, I thought, yeah, I got to, I've got to figure it out, right? And, and quite frankly, that's when I started to fail, that's when things started to not go so well when I kind of started limiting my personal growth, my professional growth, because I, I thought I hadn't figured out. So, in, in that, in that vein Roger, is there anything that any book or any resource that you may recommend to folks who are maybe starting out in that leadership role that kind of helped help them blossom if you will. And if you will. Yeah, I got tons of. I, I tell you the three, the three that I probably recommend the most, I mean, I'm a huge Stephen Covey fan. And it, I think, you know, he, he, I think he passed away and I think there's, he started to fade into the background, I say there's some plastics out there and the seven habits of highly successful people is one that I still, I feel those principles come to my mind. Even today, even even in things like being a grandparent, I mean, there's just things that that are there a lot of wisdom in those seven habits of highly, so if, if there are people out there never read that book, I recommend it to almost everybody that I coach. And then I'm a big fan of Drucker Peter Drucker and so anything that Drucker has written I think he's got he has tremendous handle on managing people and and so a lot of the principles that. That I spouts, I guess would be the right word is come from Drucker, I pulled him quite a bit. And then the third one and this one was kind of later in my career, but a book called leading change. Okay, and I, you know, it. I'm a big believer that if you keep doing the same things the same way you're going to get the same results and and there are times when I think I put that and thought that and said I just need to do them a little bit better and so changes is central in. In, in almost any endeavor in an higher education, I think there changes imminent almost all the time and in enrollment management as well. And yet I think we're all kind of tend to be novices that really how do you, how do you implement change and how do you actually become a part of the machinery of leading change. And so trying to remember the author's name embarrassed that I can't but the title of the book is leading change because I've recommended it so often so those are three that I've been pretty commonly recommended. Okay, that's the. I've got to be a little bit better. I think it's done. I'm kind of all right, great. Thank you for that. You mentioned earlier to about the self awareness piece right now, I think this goes a little bit with something that's resonated with me as I've gone around and visited with with teams and and you talked about. Or at least alluded to that burnout right that. Sometimes you're going to have really good years sometimes you're you're not going to have good years and and sometimes it's it's partially your fault and sometimes it's not your fault at all right, but I think that in terms of the the middle health aspect of being in this role, especially for so long and I'm I'm self sharing here, but my last institution right so much stress that I thought I had done something to my shoulder I couldn't lift my arm pass parallel and. And you know, took some time away and miraculously it it healed with you know nothing and it was just the stress and it's amazing how stress will manifest itself in in your body. Physical body and so is there is anything you could suggest in terms of like. The mental health perspective for the young the the young and says they say you know out there that are that are that are you know new to this career field and making sure that they don't they don't burn out to early. I told you as in this mentoring program this leadership program it is absolutely by far the most asked question is how how do I establish. I work life balance so that I'm so because I feel like I'm going to burn out if I keep it up at this pace and if I keep. I'm responding to the stress the way I'm responding to the stress now every almost everybody I've ever coached or mentored. In enrollment management has asked that question at some level in some way and so I there are no there aren't a magic answer probably the most common thing and you know usually I try to get to know the personal life better before I actually give it. I'm going to give it to the dice on that but I probably the most common thing that I'll tell them is you've got to be a got to be conscious of it and obviously you are and that's great because sometimes like you said sometimes we just get so caught up in because because we're motivated people. In that end up in those leadership roles and we just we're just we're so motivated we just keep grinding and don't even realize what we're doing to our bodies or to our minds and and that we're burning out until it's maybe too late. But so number one be conscious of it and by being conscious of it you can then intentionally set some goals for how much time have I got to spend with my spouse or my. Significant other or my kids or whatever how much you know sets some goals about you know limiting certain. A amount of work or making sure that you do certain things that you enjoy doing that you know are going to relax you. Disciplining yourself to take vacation time even when. You know it might be a difficult thing to do knowing what you're going to think when you get back and all of that but this point so just setting goals that are actually geared toward. Taking care of yourself in fact one of those seven habits that I was talking about this team and cubby. He talks about sharpening the saw he said you know think of yourself as a tool and how that tool is only effective. If it's a saw it's only effective in sharpening if you don't take the time to stop and sharpen that saw. You know work your tail off and not ever get anything done and that's what we end up going with our with our with in our leadership role we work like crazy and don't realize why we're not getting it maybe it's because the saw got. And and you need to keep it sharp and and so that work life balances a part of that so when we think we're going to for fit result. If we take time off and relax and we take care of ourselves. Yeah, I love that analogy and the sharpening of the fall for me personally a lot of that was just taking a week away doing some professional development right going to a conference maybe getting a new new idea and in some way. I've been to to a large extent I mean we I think a lot of folks have tried their hardest to do conferences virtually and I certainly miss the face of face conferences and I think it. To an extent you know we don't get the gatherers professionals and kind of talk about the challenges that we're facing in higher ed so switching gears just a little bit here but what do you see as some of the challenges that are being faced and in higher ed. And I follow up to that question what is leaders in higher ed can we do to help overcome those. Yeah, I make the secret fault Roger. Yeah, I'm yeah I get asked questions about what what should be done like right after I retired the whole thing about. What was it where where. The Department of Labor came out with this idea that they you had to get that in admissions counselor had to be hourly employees right at that's how I remember it and everybody's asking me what what would you do and I never faced that issue let me let me think about it. There's some things that have come up since I was in the field that I got I'm just an outsider kind of thinking it through my own logic and then the pandemic came and I never had to go through a. When I would. And role management so I have to just kind of sit down and sort out. So I don't know that I have answers but I tell you one that hasn't changed is an old man especially for for small private college that is I mean you talk about challenges that. Small private colleges are facing in and some of the larger rooms as well is is enrollment whether it's actually because that's how your institution is funded your tuition ribbon and you're. Not getting enough students every year to make ends meet or whether it's an access issue for for some larger. Institutions that are necessarily doing it. Meeting the enrollment for for funding but enrollment is still a challenge is a challenge everywhere and it's actually. The the challenges increased. Not just because of covid but you know as we know that demographic cliff is coming in. So smaller private colleges have got to figure out how to compete for us piece of a smaller pie. And and how do you get the same number of students if that guy is shrinking you're going to have to be getting students that other institutions would have gotten before right your competing. And so and some of them are already in a deficit mode and so they just set simply set the budget on what they need in order to balance their budget without any kind of an idea is to how that might happen what changes. And so we're talking about adaptive change earlier you get you got to make adaptive changes in order for enrollment to. To increase because if you keep doing the same things the same way it's not always just because your admissions offices are working smart or hard enough right. And so but institutions are going to set those budgets and then enrollment people are going to be caught in that trap of well. And so that's what the goal is but I honestly don't see any possible way that we could possibly but we're going to dig in and try and that whole cycle is still happening. Maybe happening more than ever because because of the chance so enrollment is still one of the biggest challenges and I think it'll continue to be. I think for our senior's we are thinking we will return it to the impacts of different senior trust. I think there's. make sense given my observations on college and university campuses. So it's a little bit grandios, but I think one of the challenges that higher education is facing now is the polarization that's occurring in our culture on social and political issues. And it got exacerbated because of COVID and the whole pandemic thing because now you got faculty members who are on one side of what needs to be done in a crisis like that and then faculty members who are on another side and administrators who are both side, students who are on both side, and you get this fractured campus and it seems to me like whether it's COVID or whether there are other things happening in our culture that we've lost our ability to have civil discourse on these kinds of very difficult social and political issues. I mean higher education in my mind has always brightened itself on critical thinking, having a safe place for people to come together and to discuss all the sides of every issue no matter how difficult that issue is and now it seems like people are digging in and they're kind of wanting to rather than discuss the issue, they want to attack the other person, attack the other faculty member or attack the other student or attack the other administrator or attack the other college or university as a and cancel their, we call it the cancel culture and cancel their credibility as opposed to having civil discourse about the issue and realizing that people have different opinions and different positions. So from an enrollment manager to standpoint where I take that is, are we going to end up at some point? I mean it used to be verboten for for me as an administrator to take a political position and and and preaches on my campus. I wasn't supposed to do that. We weren't supposed to take a position politically or even on a lot of social issues as an institution. That's what we're therefore we're there to have this type of discussion that's unbiased but now I'm seeing institutions who are putting a stake in the ground and saying we're this. So are we going to get to a point where students are going to have to choose I'm not going to be welcome at that campus so the here's my list of schools that I could that I would be welcome at given my point of view and and then people on the other side here my list. I would hate to see that that's I don't think that's what higher education was supposed to be all about in America and yet I see as migrating for that polarization to the point where the institutions themselves are labeling themselves and saying we don't welcome your viewpoint whether you're a faculty member or a student or an administrator. I don't know if it's that bad or not but I've heard other people talking about this being one of the things that higher education is going to have to deal with and I do think it can affect enrollment management at some level. Yeah I I think you make some really valid point Roger right you know I think back to at least my college experience and you know I went to a faith face institution born and raised as a as a as a as a as a Baptist right went to a Baptist institution and I I think back to one of my favorite classes whether religion professor who challenged pretty much everything that we had ever been taught as a as a Baptist growing up and I thought what is happening here but it wasn't him trying to go to us or beat us into you know being upset or it was it was to get our critical thinking moving and and to challenge us to not always just take everything you hear necessarily or read at face value but to to do some digging for yourself and learning for yourself to get that critical thinking aspect and yeah I I was in in text as a few weeks ago and it was funny I saw a I saw a bumper sticker and it said the great national death and then you know cynical and critical thinking right and to you know to your point that I laughed at the bumper sticker and I thought I'll leave there's there's probably something to that so yeah that's that's a that's really great really great advice on that yeah and hopefully we don't head down that path as higher ed institution I think about those enrollment challenges that that you mentioned as well and you know I think about as we mentioned books earlier I know you and I both have had the chance to read Dr. Nathan Grolls books and even hear him speak you know the demographics I think in a demand for higher ed I would say to if somebody is in enrollment and hasn't read that you need to make sure that you're your cabinet understands that book the data that's in that book and particularly your board as well I think he's got a follow up book to agile college which is also really good to really good data but you know we're surrounded by data right and especially as enrollment professionals now I mean you mentioned early in your career is more more record right and if you want to some either pull a report it was it was a lot of manual digging for those reports and now with that these awesome CRM that somebody can push a button and you know two minutes later give you a pretty extensive report on just about anything that you want do you do you I find and I'm curious on your thoughts because I could be very much wrong on this that a lot of folks a lot of colleges have all this data at their fingertips and they're almost paralyzed by the data that they have because they don't know where to start because there's so much data to process and I would almost even say it's to an extent almost like a blind spot for them because they just don't know where to get started on different initiatives I'm curious if you've seen that as you've done consulting and you know inner and work at at a lot of different colleges absolutely I mean you know my good friend Tim Fuller who I do a lot of my consult with and one of his favorite points to make with people is that you can have a lot of data but the data is not what's important it's what you do with the data you know it's not it's not it's not even just analyzing you can analyze it and make a bunch of conclusions but unless you do something with those conclusions what what's the point is a whole lot of wasted a wasted data so to speak and and I think that is what's happening is everybody hears that you need to have data so now they have data but has a really changed anything that they're doing has a really made any difference in in their strategies or in their tactics and and all of that and then and then of course there's still a lot of people there are still a lot of people out there and you know I I just say good luck to you but who don't think that that data is important you know and and I don't think you should just disregard your gut in fact I will go with my gut over data pretty often but I sure want to know but the data is before I go but there are some people that are just going to disregard it or I think the biggest sin is generalizing on sample size of one is what I call it is when when they hear one anecdote and they go hey I'm going to go after that and they don't do any further research or look at look at any data anecdotal information is important but it can easily become coming to conclusions based on sample size of one you got really careful yeah yeah that's that's great advice so I know we're coming up on time it's hard to believe we're we're closing in on an hour here I can't believe I've got two no right I've got a million more questions I'd love to ask you but but two I'd love to specifically ask you and then again I've got a lot more and maybe we can do do another session here in the future but you know you mentioned this a little bit earlier if you could go back to the very beginning of your your enrollment management career Roger and talk to the young Roger right the the I imagine 20 or early 30s Roger what would you what advice would you give that that young Roger that just started out in the enrollment management field yeah I feel like I think the answer is I gave so far to some of your other questions probably answered that I you know I think that don't take the blame in the in the in the credit as readily as you're going to be attempted to do don't carry that burden yourself I think that's number one and I think that also addresses the issue that you brought up about about stress and and burnout and all of that I think if you don't learn to do that if you don't discipline yourself you don't realize some people don't even realize hey it's not necessarily all my fault and they haven't thought beyond that either sometimes I'm talking to a young professional and you go really it doesn't all it doesn't all follow me it doesn't all follow you you get to do your job you get to do it well and we'll talk about that but just because you do your job well doesn't mean this institution is going to grow it absolutely is not the only fact and but some people are conditioned to think that and so that that would always be my number one thing that I go back to and say I wish I would have learned that earlier in my career and and then the things that I mentioned earlier about you know about delegation and about identifying my blind spots and about self-awareness those are the things that are put on that. Yeah those are great those are great and I think good good reminder to here in the second time so we you did talk a little bit earlier about the 2008 right kind of rising to the top if you will is it's college worth it is the debt load worth it some my final question to you is in your opinion Roger Kiefer this college worth it. Yeah I mean of course I'm going to say it's worth it and I mean I spent my entire entire career dedicated to helping to promote the idea of students attending college and carefully choosing which college is going to be best for them given their roles in life so so of course I'm going to answer the question is worth it but I understand why it's a question now I mean I do understand that there's some factor that have come up in our in our culture and and so you know I I I can address some of those but I I guess I would start by saying you can't argue there's no way you can put an argument together that would that would that would that would fly in the face of the idea that you're you're more likely to be financially secure if you have a college degree than if you know I mean the date is just so clear and what happens is we got people who are looking at successful people that didn't get a college degree and saying see now go yeah of course but don't I'll go back to that don't don't make a life decision based on a sample size of one or or on the exception rather than the rule and so you may be one of those people I'm not going to tell you that you have to go to college but if you're asking me if it's worth it I'm going to say yes and if you're asking me if it's worth it financially you can't argue with that data that data is way too clear for you to argue that well no I'm I'm just as likely to make as much money if I went to college as if I don't know that's not true you might and you might be one of those people but don't make a life decision based on a sample size of one and then the opposite thing too I mean the whole idea well it's not worth it because look at these people who took on all that data and then couldn't dig their way out of it and they blamed the fact that they went to college on that well those are such a tiny tiny tiny percentage of all the people that ever borrowed to go to college why would you make a decision based on that small tiny little sample size as opposed to looking at the big picture and so so just from the standpoint of why people think maybe it's not worth it it just really doesn't make it stand up to logic but but I'll be the first person to say who am I to say whether you should go to college I mean do there are many people I mean I I was a first generation college goal or seven kids in our family I'm the fifth in the family I'm the first one and those seven to get a college degree then my two younger siblings got a college degree so I'm I'm very much a first generation college girl I'm a first generation high school diploma get her I mean my mom and dad neither one guy I school diploma they came from the agrarian culture of central Pennsylvania and it didn't make sense for them and I think they had a very old and fulfilling life my parents did and so I can't I you know I can't necessarily say to every individual you must get a college degree I think everybody ought to consider it and I think there are good reasons for you to think it's it's worth it so to answer the question is college worth it hands down there's absolutely no question but I do understand some of these factors that have caused people to question it I'm just saying look at the big picture and look at look at the data look at the you know don't get caught up into individual stories and to figure out what you want to do with your life because that does some some bearing on whether or not you're going to need a college degree and then are you sure that's what you want to do your whole life you know those kinds of things I love one one say that I heard I think it came out of Elon University where the academic dean used to say your major will get to your first job and your liberal arts will get you every job after that and so the the whole idea that we think we know exactly what we're going to do our entire career but but but understanding you know yourself and the big questions of life and the all the things that that a complete college degree will give you it you can't put a price on yeah that's a great answer I couldn't agree the degree more will Roger it has been an absolute pleasure to spin this almost hour with you I think back to the fact that when you joined us in in 2017 a ran a quick number 1,883 days that we have worked together and I think I've learned 1,883 things from you and today is not
