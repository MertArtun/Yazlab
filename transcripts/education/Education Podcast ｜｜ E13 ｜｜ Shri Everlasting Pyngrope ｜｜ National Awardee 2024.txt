going forward it will stay like this so this is education podcast here we invite teachers, principals, students and you know a lot of people who are involved in education and doing many things so today we have the principal of Minkhen school from Boirembong and he just received the national award and we are thrilled to listen to him for various things we have done I have known him personally since I joined this director of school education post and we have been seeing the performance but today let us hear from him so welcome to this education podcast thank you sir first I want you to tell everyone how does it feel to receive a national award first of all I will very much thankful to the government states government who recommend my name and also the union government who recognize my effort as a teachers and as a principal to give me this national teachers award 2024 so from my parts I am very much happy for getting this award and it will inspire me more in my service as the principal to uplift the education in my institution and also in this area as a whole but how did it feel when you went there and you received from honorable president so what is that feeling yeah it was so much excited after hearing the news and also after you know traveling to Delhi to receive these awards experiencing all the protocol to meet the honorable president of India and to stay there at a show hotel with lots of protocol so it was very much excited and also to meet all the national awardee of the country from different parts of India so we are very much happy to meet them and share with them and so friendly with them also knowing how they also endeavor in their task as a teacher and as a principal of their respective school so it was very amazing and very much you know excited to be experienced in going there to receive the awards from the honorable presidents of India did you get to interact with other awardees yeah we are very much friendly because we stayed and right from the 3rd of September in Ashoka hotels lots of meeting also before going to receive this award at Bigyan Bhawan so lots of preparation also rehearsal on the 4th the whole day rehearsal just how to prepare for receiving this award so during those time we could share different awardees from different schools of the states knowing about their effort knowing about their you know experience there and how they also through their dedication and hard work through in their field and to come up receiving this award as a national awardee of 2024 okay so here is it you can all see it is here and yeah we have 55,000 teachers in the state and you know only one gets every year and it's not every year also so that's also another thing so it's a proud moment for the state as well so we are also proud of you so next your the football team from here has done really well in the recently held tournaments so what is the I mean of course there we see many football teams from but what is the secret of success how they are doing so well you know this school Mankan Christian Higher School Sir it's very much taking so much initiative in bringing up the sports person of this area because this area there are a lot of potential of the sports person either in athletic or in football so our schools since its inception and after few years of inception it had taken part continuously not stop of this Subroto Cup football tournament so right from that time Subroto had become a part of our you know academic and because we are always ahead so many of the talented students also they seek admission in these schools so after getting all the good talented students in this particular sports that is why always every year we could reach their final of the state level mostly nearly all the three teams sometime that this year or two all the three teams or two teams are there on the 15 but we on the 15 they lost in the final other district level so that is why right from we start winning right from 1999 in that year on the 14 they are the champion of the state level and the first time they go to the national level to play but we lost in quarter final to Ranci St John Ranci that year so again in 2011 over on the 17 boys qualified as champion of the states level so there also that year we match as a runner-up at the national level this is trophy of Ranci in 2011 that year also we lost in just one goal in penalty so it's a culture I see it's in the DNA of the schools so now students also identify like if they study here they have a good chance of succeeding in the football besides that we take a lot of you know preparation right from you know the start of the session by January February we all always do normal practice morning and after schools so because so many so many you know ex students also with very experienced football players so they also help in this coaching this student I just give them you know some other room at the end of the session so that is why the team come up very much you know in to be the champion at the district level at the state level many times so in 2015 also the under 17 girls they qualified the champion of the state but there they lost in the national level in that oh so you have a girl's team also the girls team also very good that is girls team also they have it's uh uh Delhi what they lost in the quarter final so this year we have got a very good team so this year after getting looking at the performance of the boys you know before five days before the state level we took them to the size sports center for ground practices ground experience and we stay there in the Tiroch singe guest house for one week just for ground experience for the boys because we have got a good number of people so the result come up very effectively very effectively at the moment they play at the state level they won by five goals by six goals that is why they they up to the final also they won by three one in the final of the state level so that is why they are very much that this team is the team which is all the students remain from the district level state level Anna the national level that is why their team combination is so strong okay that is why they put but they have a chemistry already I mean you know that thing but anyway finally it's a final yeah it's okay I mean you know it happens sometime but still the state is proud of them and it's wonderful so here what we can learn is that you know it's in the DNA of the school so if we want to promote anything right from the beginning we have to put it in the DNA DNA so similar to him we are seeing in some of the principles are taking interest in chess and they are organizing tournaments recently that Moflong we went Moflong government UP and we are 200 kids from rural area they came and participated so this I think this you can learn from this school that if you want good results it has to be in the DNA in the DNA very good so you are last time I visited I saw you're doing lot on vocational education so few thoughts on that yeah sir this school had been chosen as the one of the 10 school in the country for innovative education the innovative model for vocationals so we have got two stream here that is agriculture and beauty and wellness so this one has been has started right from 2019 but due to the pandemic we cannot proceed with it so in 2020 we start in class 9 and in class 11 so in 22 the first result of this vocational they shine the student shine and getting the highest marks in both the subject in beauty in wellness and agreeing so this particular you know vocational subjects so sir regarding the vocational stream in this school we were chosen by the directorate as the one of the innovative model for education vocational education in collaboration with this Pandit Sharma vocational institute Bhopal this is the part of the ncrt so right from that year after a director from the pscc ivy they come here they visit our schools and they encourage us to start to proceed with this particular two subjects so after that we start the class 9 and class 11 and in 2022 they appeared for the board exam for the first time and they they pass in good percentage and students they are their highest marks in the megalithobot in these two subjects so from that year it encouraged a lot for their local students also to join these streams so every year after that not even one year also without having a student highest mark in this two particular subject in the in the emboss so we are very much happy because after learning from this vocational stream there are some girls student they have started of their own a kind of small beauty parlor in their village helping the people who want to do that makeup and also some student who are passed from agriculture stream they start a mushroom cultivation they start doing this you know nursery also of their own and some student they have learned of a bernie compost you know preparation for that and here also we have some product of this bernie compost or the initiative of the vocational teachers and mostly it's very much successful because we have two dedicated vocational teachers all of them they are very sincere and hard work in helping the students so now quite a big number of students want to enroll in these vocational subjects so regarding the materials we have got sufficient materials because this has been given by the ncrt all the material are coming from ambala and full drops and then we have two vocational labs one is beauty and wellness and the other one is agriculture now okay so do students see the value of vocational education yes sir they they could see the value of it because as of now like this year I mean do they interest with interest they do it or they do it just because you are telling them to do it like is you know can you see the difference yeah in the beginning since it's very new hardly they want to enroll also okay they are very what is this subject they how to take this subject or whether there will be in the boat or not they after explaining after highlighting them that they have a choice of the in place of health education they take agree or they take beauty or they take computer so in in health and physical education period student will go to agree some student will go to beauty and wellness some student will go to computer lab so they have their own different subject in that particular place we have to divide them so only the health education will remain in the class the rest will go to the respective room so they see the value of it now because after they learn they could see the value of it because you know one student learn they are enjoy and they are happy they learn how to make vermicompost they learn how to prepare for mushroom cultivation so like last year we start new innovative also that hydrophonic plantation also we buy the material student learns how they wonder how without soil also that plants will grow so now they they learn all these are great great you also have a curiosity gym yeah how is what are the results of you know that gym regarding curiosity gym after the government from their education department they have selected our school to be the pilot project of this curiosity gym to have this step program so during that time one person from this curiosity gym approach sir Girishner he come and got interview with me after a long of interview he said this is the right place that we should start this program then there only we proceed with the at rolling this program and also to first to trade all the three teachers who are in involving in this step program so it is around four days training by expert from Mumbai from curiosity gym then after they got the training they starts learning it and then as I could see that children are very much excited to learn all these things especially the small one to learn all all the small innovative things like you know like air balloon and then now they could go to the to the to the park to measure a three how to measure a three then they could prepare a robot how a robot work and now they they learn how to to do with this you know three depends on all how did the 3d printing machines also how it works so students are very much excited now also so previously we since it come a little bit late we could not put in the routine of the students but from this year we also put a period in the routine of the student so that they also will going on with this particular program that is the program so this program still going on now and we have also another you know branches from the government that is a multi-purpose last year we have conducted in the exhibition here so it was very much successful people could see how this program started and this year also I could attend there at Maunga the exhibition there at Maunga this is very amazing how students from the rural area how students from rural area learn a lot of things and they have done so many also which kind of new innovative and technology which is to learn you know as a for the rural student to get a chance of learning such new things it was encouraged most to to focus for their higher studies or for their higher educations so basically this curiosity is him is making science interesting right so now students find it interesting interesting very much that's something which is very important for me ghalay that is very much we have been struggling with making science interesting yeah so that's a good news so next is about this out of school children so last time you shared something that you provided them some of the family space so that they can because for their house was very far and all that so tell everyone about this like you know what was this and are they still studying or have they joined back school yeah regarding this this particular thing that I have shared in previously also regarding this uh uh opportunity that we have given to all the rural students now this schools being a deficit schools you know our fees also quite minimal and they are coming right from border of Assam there are so many villages from border some like you know umtli then maula's night or so which is bordering of Assam so student from there to get rented house in this Bharambang area they find very much difficult because Bharambang is a quite even though it is a village so many institution are here and you know students from different villages of this area also are coming so since we have got a very big plot of land 17 acres 0.611 acres uh overland is just lying so right from uh the year 1990 of 1990 above few shed of houses were allowed for the student to construct in our land so that they can study there study in this school and then stay in this slowly slowly this one was added and many are coming from different far villages construct their own shed of bamboo houses and stay here so after they pass no no the relatives also are coming and then the brothers younger brother also join they are still staying in this plot of land of the schools okay so this this help a lot in you know providing you know quality they completed their schooling with those who stayed and now their brothers and sisters and relatives also join okay so this was this is really amazing uh next is that I see that there's a lot of community support in this school also the SMC side and I think from the community as well so uh yeah so what are your thoughts I mean how important is community support for a school to succeed we need community support you know without community support it's very difficult especially nowadays you know one in protecting the you know the the compound of the school the proper the school property so if the community support the village support the helpmen are supporting then it's very very much helpful secondly you know once we once we raise any organize any program the community they took part very very you know enthusiastically and also they joined hand together so as of now also we are raised we are organizing the foot fests and sales of work the the works which were prepared by the students and their SUPW social useful productive work so we organize this foot fest consists of work to raise funds for the construction of our auditorium because this side we don't have a big auditorium we don't have a big hall that is why when we want to have a meeting we have to remove the partition that a big loss of pro you know school school property so the managing committee took the initiative of starting this auditorium so we just announced to the parents to the well wishes of this area if they could donate from their agriculture product student one student he could bring one pumpkin or one you know one vegetables one item of vegetables so the moment we announced we could see that a lot of you know supporting from the community from the parents from parents from community from parents and community so hopefully that this program will be successful and yes we could raise you know sufficient fund for his purpose great so students from mighalaya find it difficult to compete at the national level in in various competitive exams so what can we do as a you know state as a department as a school yeah i have shared this particular to some other you know interviewer also we need a strong foundation sir you know we need a strong foundation right from that primary section so once they are having a strong foundation at their primary section see like in maths and science and also to to proceed in their studies so slowly and slowly they will come up with very you know in a strong with a strong foundation they could come up successfully so to strengthen our education system we need to find out ways and means to strengthen right from the primary level to the secondary level and then up to the secondary and higher secondary level so if they are having good foundation at the beginning hardly they will drop out because they find interest in it they find that they could you know they could catch up with the with the higher studies so that is why if the over government takes the initiative to strengthen right from the primary level by providing good quality of education and hopefully that our education system will be will match with the students of other states in our country great any thoughts on NEP yeah NEP with that five plus three plus three plus four i think will help and cater the needs of strengthen our education in the country first of all if we if the states could provide more institution to have this school complexes having you know opening the higher secondary section in arts and science and commerce the student will study in the same institution through the whole of their school career then that automatically will solve the dropout problem of the states and the country as a whole so that is one of the new initiative of the new education policy great so ict and basically the whole computers and making computers available and the ed tech new ed tech is coming a lot of apps a lot of this that so how do you think this will change the way we impart education hopefully that it will change you know with us here we have two smart classes one computer lab ict lab so you know the students when they study only with their books you know they find it's very difficult to catch up but with the new technology like ict and this you know we have the project or also to show them with slide to show them with in the smarts class student they could see and learn at the same time so it helps them to catch up it's some difficult topics as well they could be able to catch up easily with the using of this new technology okay so this will only help teachers it helps the teachers great so lastly i want you to give a message to all the principals out there we have roughly 14 000 schools and more than 14 000 schools so we will have that many principals and then we have teachers senior teachers and guardians and parents so message to all of them how we can collectively contribute to improve education in megalay yes yeah that's great sir so i have worked in this institution for the last 34 years you know i took charge as the principal in 2011 but right from 2007 the school authority had already entrusted me with the task of a coordinator in 2007-2009 i'm the coordinator of the CPE certificate course for primary education this is run by Igno through the government so i got a chance to meet with all the teachers of this area primary teachers of this area whom selected by the district school education officer of the district to complete this six month certificate course here so by that time i could avail myself to you know imbibe in them the spirit of dedication and hard work unless teachers are responsibility and hard work and then we could uplift the whole institution so from my part as took charge as the principal in 2011 by that time our infrastructure was not so good we have only a sometime house which was constructed right from 1963 the roof nearly you know so many scratch and holes but when i took charge i my my focus by school vision and mission we have school vision and mission so our mission how to bring change how to bring change first to get infrastructure and all so at the initial stage we start from our own you know like in this compound we have so many big big pine trees by that time so we sold out those pine trees and then start the construction but fortunately in 2018 1718 with the school improvement program of this megalaya government with this through the edb project so they allotted school building to many schools in the state i think around 117 schools something i heard so our school also was selected to have this good building so after we have this good building so we feel very much you know happy with a new building with a new vision with a new thinking to starts to for the improvement of 20 so with the school improvement program providing a training for all the teachers after that so many of the teachers attended so we start you know learning new things like forming plc professional learning community then we have different clubs literary club here we established and by that time we established a school environmental council so student there's extra learning of the students so it we could see that it could bring some changes in their academic studies so after that our you know best practices is with establishment of the library there we start the library how to start library we start the library with a very initial stage we got a donation from the sponsoring body with it almeiras to as a shelf for books there in the library then we start raising fund approaching here and there to strengthen our library so our library is a very little bit you know good standard of library with a much number of books there also so from the DRT also they have approached us and they get a recording about our best practices also to show to the others institution also that library is so important in schools so we see there is a change also after we you know we established this good library there is a change to them starts coming to the library and we subscribe new spirit papers every day so long times and get hussy local students learn there you know start knowing about their current affairs and all so there are a number of books with c u et also there are students who stay here in our campus who pass c u et even though the government did not allow without c u t also they passed four five of them they pass c u et when they passed they joined poll science in in colleges in shalom so it shows that library also helps a lot so in our school mission we start one year after the others after library then it come to our management committee and to the staff meeting let us have a bus school bus so when we find the initiative we approach the chief minister so we thanks sir konrad for granting from the chief minister for 10 lakhs to purchase school bus but 10 lakh is not enough so i ask management committee can we use the school fund to have one school bus so they allowed the remaining fund to have a school bus so the school bus helps a lot you know it raised the standard with the school you know in a rural area to have a school bus and then it helps especially for us whom our team football team go to the district level to the state level for coaching them you know school bus helps a lot in our effort to uplift the schools so more mostly important is that to build the strong you know relationship with the staff to imbibe in them to have the same vision the vision for bringing changes you know to vision to bring changes so to build a strong you know like a small family a minkan family everyone should see that we should have the same vision same goals so if this come to the every mind to the every you know heart of the teachers they also they will work with you know with passion they will work with passion of bringing changes so i told them for the last 60 years for 60 years of establishment of the school to 1963 to 2003 there is not even a single year that our name is there in the top 10 or 20 of the board i said come on let us look at that particular thing so we have in 2022 class then we are very good but students so i said this is the year that we put graphs and the opportunity so we took extra classes we took that we called parent we should call parent also and call the parents of the girl talking along with the girls and then see you also must support her ambition also support we also will support with the support of the parent with the aim of the student also with the support of the teachers so in 2023 we appeared in the list in the top 15 list so that year is very much happy with the schools so this is you know this is the important part as the role of the principal to build you know the strong relationship there should not be a gap between the principal and the teachers should be a close gap should be a friendly relationship so when they love and when they see the the same vision whatever task you entrusted them will do it with their great passion and in this way we could uplift the institution so after you know having all these things that will have the vision that we have got already all the arts and then we are open commerce in 2013 so the remaining is only science let us start this science stream so in 2022 we in the management committee i raised this agenda and the management committee okay you go ahead allowed to proceed with the swiss start with two students only but after 11 that one student also dropped out so there is only one in 2023 one student in class 12 science in 23 but anyway there are 15 in class 11 science but so there is a hope so i approached the education department for the NOC so thanks to the government to our director to grant the NOC so after getting the NOC we get the opening permission and now we all just received three four days back i received the affiliation from the mbrose so now students can appear only with our own name only from the center in 12 science so since only one student last year in 12 science it's very very much you know you know focus on her last year we take we now sing her call the parent and all because if she feel it will be zero percent but if she pass will be 100 percent very good so i keep on promising her i said if you pass whatever division you pass i'll give 5000 from my pocket so she passed in second division sir so pass in second division and i call her here in the assembly giving that 5000 and everybody club so this year we have got 10 in class 12 so they pass the selection test so all these 10 are good so maybe next year all the 10 will be will pass in the name of mink and because last year we club with alpha higher stint is full number so now we have got 17 in 11 17 in 11 and 10 in 12 so the science stream also and with smoothly regarding the permanent teachers there's a big burden because you know like last year one student we pay around more than two lakhs for one for one student but anyway yeah because we have found out the experience when we start arts in 2004 there's only four students now there are 280 art students all together with all the three stream we have got 347 only in the highest construction arts science and commerce 347 so that's quite quite alarming so we fulfill all the required norms with that school complexes which is according to the norms of the new education policy having all our streams commerce stream and science stream so as the commerce stream they perform very well many years first division are more than the second division this year we have 28 all the 28 were qualified to appear the board exam no one detained so we hopefully that this batch also will do a good batch for commerce so the message to all the principals to all my colleague friends in the education department and the only that we should focus focus in our goal to bring a change and that focus also with dedication to bring good community relationship among the styles and then let them also see that changes to be achieved with our sincerity and hard work hopefully that if every one of us having with that same you know aim and vision and mission then theoretically the whole education system in our state will come up in a very good within us in a satisfactory way so the national teachers awards which I didn't expect that much but I thank the government for giving this recognition so the receiving of these national awards it is a you know a happiness for me for receiving before retirement actually to meet you know the president of the country sharing with our honorable prime minister Narendra Modi meeting Sir Dharmendra Pradhan education minister there in Delhi and receiving a lot of you know a lot of encouragement from them also one message which I want to share to all also what what we receive from our honorable prime minister Sir Modi said you are the only people of my country who can plus one you know you plus one engineer you plus so that's kind of you know encouragement it's really you know lighting up our spirit of dedication and hard work so I could see because our honorable prime minister had encouraged us to form a WhatsApp group all the national awardee so till date we are in one of the group of national awardee so we share Sir Modi said whatever you knew thing you learned from Pedela you share in the group whatever you learn from Meghalaya you learn from Sikkim you learn from others and then we could see also that so many encouragement also from different states comment to all the awardees some of the oddies they are you know they welcome them in a road show also you know so like Sikkim from the government side to the national awardee they have foreign trip in Mizoram you know the national awardee he get one year extension of service or one advance increment right so they share that you know our groups are different states you know like you know Punjab also we are doing in that way so I think with that if the government took that kind of you know initiative also so every you know heads of the institution not only heads of the institution also every teachers you know there are many awardees who are not the heads they are also simply teachers but their dedication and work were admired by everybody there are teachers who travel in cycle from door to door and educate the student teach to student in that way so that is the effort so all teachers or principal we should have passion with our work so if we have passion with our work to achieve our goals so there is no you know painful you know we don't feel tired at all you know coming to schools early in the morning you know myself I always reach school be by 830 sometime by 8 you know to settle everything before the school starts you know knowing about what teachers do and what to be done that is you know the the message that I would give to all the friends and fellow colleagues in the in the education department. Thank you thank you that was enlightening I would say and I'm sure everyone will agree this interview has been very enlightening for me as director and I'm sure for you as principal teacher or a parent you would have learned a lot from this interview and if you know similar examples please let us know so that we will invite them on this education podcast and we all can learn from them thank you so much for watching. Thank you so much.
