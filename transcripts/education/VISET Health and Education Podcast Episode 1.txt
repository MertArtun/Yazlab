 Welcome to this episode of the Informal Economy, Health and Education podcast. Your enter is each item. This episode I'm joined here by City of Obeil, Communications Officer, the National Council. Welcome back. Thank you very much. It's been quite a pleasure to meet you. Also joining us is City Puewe, when you are sitting here, it's about Obeil, the Assistant Director of the City of Obeil. Thank you. And we are also joined by Yohem Emezi, our youth informal trader from Obeil. Welcome. Thank you so much. Okay, so to just get them more rolling, they were talking about highly-conservations. They are important to the sectors, we consider the same, that is the youth, the residents, the tutubi era, the year to highlight how they walk through this process. So maybe you start by asking me what are the key highlights of the Puewe 24-mage review and how will you impact business in the way? Thank you very much. Excited to ask you about the activities. As a local operator, it's been very much a year, our Puewe 24-mage review. First of all, we are very excited about the response of the people who are teammates to ask if you can help us to get feedback on how we are performing as a local authority. And the key highlight is that people are talking about the improved water that supplies, since improved its food for the people and improved revenue collection. They are also talking about the initial frequenting of the ones before the rain. As a local authority, we are very much happy and the major highlight was the acquisition of our critical equipment, like much of the U.S. in the country. We believe that this will impact business in spite of ensuring that people provide them with the services that they want all the time, for example, the water, ensuring that there is proper sanitation, proper health care, and ensuring that the infrastructure is in order. As a local authority, we believe that we have much of the feedback that we got from the business associations and the stakeholders at large. It has helped us to ensure that when we look at the footprint from the budget, we share it in line with what the people want as the business authority. Okay, if I can add any questions of trust policy and accountability in this process, what measures have been taken to ensure trust policy and accountability in the budgeting process? In the budgeting process, for us to be transparent, we should ensure that we update the budget approach, which we always do, and ensure that we also update the financial statements. We always ensure that when it comes to budget issues, we will transfer it from day one. For example, we invite everyone who is supposed to be inputting in the budget from the review. If you have realized what I said before, we say that we invite everyone for the stakeholders to come and input, and we also ensure that those who cannot come easily can also participate using the e-platforms. So that's the way we try to ensure that we transfer it from all, transfer it from all means to all public meetings. Everything is covered, even when we did the review, we managed to ensure that it was published on social media platforms. We also included everybody, like what the President of the public is saying, that we move you with the match of ensuring that if everyone is inputted, no one is left behind. So it also incorporated sign language in every language, so that even those who cannot work, even those who cannot not hear, who understand what we are doing. And so talking of engagement, the e-platforms, the social media platforms, how do we cancel engaging with the residents and stakeholders in the 2020 budgeting process? In the 2025 budget presentations, we're going to be voting in meetings, several meetings, starting from engaging with the business associations, informal traders, different stakeholders, the business community, and we even vote with the ones who are visiting the people in their comfortable zone in their homes. And we're also going to be having e-places and e-cookies also participate in live voting in not taking public meetings. So, evolving resits, I think this is a little bit good to give us the possibility, how we are participating in those things, and what changes do we expect in this year's process? I think, as a homeless, we really need to appreciate our local authority in terms of how they are trying to do their budget consultations. There has been a very serious difference from the way that they used to do their budget consultation, particularly the budget formulation, because budget on its own is not an event, but it's a process. But now that we are also engaged in terms of budget review, it's good to us to our local authority. Now that we also inputted its residents associations into the formulation of the draft budget document, because what used to happen in the few years ago was the issue to do with them coming up with a very voluminous booklet that they would then say, go through it while we are doing the budget process. But now we inputted from the very first, and we also reviewed the budget. So that means that it gives us confidence in terms of where we are going as a local authority. So we are really engaged. We appreciate that. We will continue engaging. We have been put in as far as education and health is concerned. We are pleased to note that in 2020-24 by 2020-24 by 2020, we actually took the budget review. We were actually talking about the issue to do with increasing schools. We were talking about issues to do with having health facilities like taming the off-sale bar into a clinic, having a new site in terms of coming up with a mother's school in Koba 18. These are real serious issues that we are advocating for in the agreement. The inclusion of PWDs. We are advocating for that in the entire community. So we are saying we have been intact and we are here. So you are going to ask me to take a peek to ask you again to say, as you feel, if you participated in the pilot consultations before maybe next time, let's say it will not happen. And what are the feelings that you feel are part of the process? Okay. So I think I will start with the national part of it because it draws from that aspect. And I would like to appreciate the government for being inclusive and making sure the marginalized community is involved. But however, as in formal trade, we felt that it was a rushed process. One week it was such a little time when we were talking about the national budget pilot consultations and we felt that the time given was competing with our business. You could calculate going to Koepe or Fuma and the impact it would have on your business. So we ended up choosing our households and assuming that those who are being, who may be talking on behalf, coming back to the local authority would also like to appreciate what the city council is doing. But it seems so much significant improvement in trying to be inclusive and they are in way inclusive. But yeah, so far we have been trying to start the local bioprocesses. And from the previous experiences, yeah, we really hope like Mr. Paragasio was saying that they are not being inclusive, the e-platforms, the door-to-door sessions that they are going to. So as a few minutes about it, what do you want to see included in the package, particularly in regards to marketplaces and other education? In terms of marketplaces, we wish to have more places allocated for us because take for example, the catered mouse that is happening in our local authority, it's not something that is safe for human. All the time women are running and the cars, they are just at its very risk. And also it sprays the resources from the part of the local authority using fuel, main power and everything. So I think this budget should actually ensure that maybe more places are allocated with adequate facilities that are needed. In terms of health, I would really appreciate if we have a maintenance award in the areas of Sanam Koba, we really, really want in Koba one year, maintenance awards to be resuscitated so that it's not overwhelmed. In terms of schools, the same is really mentioned, the sector has gone massively with, we are extending the fire and fire and we really, really do need school. So, if we can make you what you promote, as I say, how can you support QE by promoting it as you build a particular example of an existing market in changing spaces? Thank you very much. I'm very excited about what you said and I'm looking at here, which is a very young case. I'd like to encourage the youth to also attend these budget consultation meetings and also encourage the trade us to attend these budget consultation meetings because if you don't attend, no one is going to come and speak and be a part of you. Just like in the hustling, if you don't go on the hustling ground, no one is going to hustle for you. The same applies with attending budget consultation meetings. So you should come and do that. If you cannot come and attend these budget consultation meetings, you also encourage the youth to attend the Yes sir. What if we plan for a formal trade-offs? If we plan for a formal trade-offs, we're looking at the revamping of Mutapa market. It's something that we've planned. If you're saying that the master plan, we also need to be at every event, we'll be telling you about the master plan. It's in the master plan when we say that we need to consider informal traders, we need to consider traders in the city of Kiru and ensure that they have places that are habitable, ensure that they have decent trading spaces. So we're looking at Mutapa market. For us, we want to develop it to be a hub of marketing, but it should be healthy, it should be decent. So that's one. We're also looking at IP market. It's almost, it's 90% complete. We're also looking at, for my market, it's 85% complete. So we're hoping that by the year 2025, we'll be talking about these percentages, but we're excited that we've done something. And we're also looking at different areas where the informal traders are coming from, from the ones. And I think that, in essence, you don't need to come in Haseulita. You can do it where you stay, because that's where the people are. So as a local authority, this is some of the things that we're looking at in the year 2025. We need to set up spaces for informal traders in the areas that they stay in, back at their homes, because that's where the people are staying. So the size of the informal traders, the way they choose to live, what are the most specific needs and priorities? What is the degree and how can they catch on this in the future? Right. Thank you very much, Itai. This is water. We cannot run away from that. They want water. If you can talk about everything in here, but immediately that they want is water. And as a local authority, it is our number one priority. We always laugh when we have meetings to say that engineer in the land of the city, water land of the city, or water. So we're looking at the entire system from the point when someone opens their tap and gets water. We need to leave them all of that. We have our engineers, they're looking into best ways of ensuring that we improve. So far, if we notice we have improved, we have been pumping water from 30.8 megalitres to around 58 times 60 megalitres per day, which is good for us. So we want to continue improving the water supply in the city. Also ensuring that water reaches the places that it has not been reaching. For example, in Richmond, we have challenges in Cobra 19, we have challenges. We are not quiet as a local authority. These are things that we keep on looking at and trying to find solutions to it. Trying to see how best we can give water. We are seeing in 2025 we do not quite end excuses. Then the other thing in terms of engagement, what we need to see them improving on is the issue to do with thematic committees leading to budget. Yes, we have been together in terms of budget reviews, which is correct. We have been together in terms of putting into the budget, which is okay. But we also then need thematic committees, thematic committees which will then speak to sector-specific issues. Like she said, she is in the informal sector. They are the only people who can better explain the challenges that they are meeting. So if you are going to formulate a thematic committee that speaks to the informal sector, then it makes sense. If you are going to formulate a thematic committee that speaks to the needs and aspirations of the youth, then it will actually help us. Because when we are dealing with the issue now, we will go back to the Mandala that said we are not leaving anyone behind because our issues are also captured. So I think by and large what our local authority needs to improve is communication. Yes, they have done that, sending messages on WhatsApp platforms, sending messages on their website, they also have Facebook pay. They are trying to do that, but in terms of those that are new to social media, we then need to find a way of making sure that they have to pass it. So I think effective communication is one area that you might need to improve on. Because yes, on social media we are very effective. I think our PR department is one of the best in the country, but are we reaching all the numbers of people that are not in person, but we really need to take away. So I think in terms of communication, they can do that. Moving on to your question, how do you think camps are facilitated for the most in the trans-maritime budgeting process? And not only the regulatory, but you can also speak to Mr. Likue here to say that there is a risk of selection. How do they need to push so that maybe people are able to attend these issues of floating out or I don't know if each of you improved. If it improved, what's your take on it? So I'm thinking, I appreciate the online platforms in accepting technology, but sometimes I think we have to go back home because the informal traders are enixed back. We have our elders, our senior citizens. So I think that Queer City Council should use those word committees, our councillors, to actually ensure that despite the e-platforms, again, even print out simple information and have motorsports in words where we just know that if you go to Cobertain Bay or there will be something that is written regarding information. And sometimes they use mailing in persons with disabilities, hearing impairment. So if you use mailing to them, they're just not being communicated with. So we need to really ensure that all those proper structures that Queer City Council ensure that the words have, the word committees are put to good use to ensure that things are not running and everyone is involved. And it's also, I would really love to have Queer City Council having a gender based violence or a gender based, because as young women in informal training, we are facing a lot of GBV cases with this cat and mouse and sometimes we really don't know how to talk or express ourselves. So sometimes we are assuming that maybe the municipality police will not have been informed, but they don't know. So this can only be addressed if we have a gender based. And coming back to you Mr. Selypio, yes, now the boy is in your hands, water is improved and everything is, the noise is down a bit. So the honour is now to you to help encourage the residents to now honour so that council can also operate smoothly. Thank you. May I invite all the GBVs, what solid promise are you going to give now to the residents of Queer City Council? Thank you for having us. What's new? We are looking at helping the 2025 material world if it's coming up. We are so trying to find a way to set it to be coming up in the 2025 budget. I cannot promise anything for the 2025 budget. The budget belongs to the people of Queer. The people of Queer make the budget. So they should come and make the budgets. They should come and make it happen. Queer who belongs to the people of Queer. We cannot do anything without the people of the City of Queer. So whatever they want us to do is exactly what we will do as a local authority. Where we face challenges, they should also come up and say, you are facing this challenge, maybe we can help with this. I am so happy about the reason the social media and the City of Queer. They always come up to the local authority to say, but you can fix this this way. It's always good when we have all those ideas to help improve the City of Queer. Thank you very much. So there you have it, people of Queer. In my side, you are a cultural insult. In 2023 we want to see improved participation in the next days for being here with us. And I think it is time to talk to the people of Queer from Queer's perspective. Thank you very much.
