And together, we're diving into creating success in your life, your community, your state, and really importantly our country. So I want to welcome back to my podcast Live Today Live Steve. That's a warning live. I want to welcome back my great friend, Steve Harvey. Steve. Yeah. Here we go. That was great. Who was that guy? I don't know. I was listening to that intro. I want to go see him. Yeah, don't you know? Yeah, man. How you been? I've been well. How about yourself? Man, I'm my life is shining, man. But just shine. Do you do it seriously? Do you ever sit back and take a pause and look at where your life is now and reflect back on where it's come from and think? How in the world did I get here? Man, I can't count the times I've done it. It's just so. It's amazing to me. I've really, man, my life is filled with so much favor. But it's been filled with so much hardship and so many tribulations and trials, man. I didn't see how it was going to get here. And then when I look around when I take a moment like you say the pause and look at where I am, I'm just, I'm amazed by all, you know, I got some steps to my front door at my house. And when I pull up at night and I pull my car and front of them steps, there's 33 steps up to my front door. You see, 11 steps, then it's a platform, 11 more platform landing and then 11 more downstairs at door. And I call them that my thank you Jesus steps. Because when I'm going up to them steps, man, I thank him them whole time I'm walking up to steps. Now keep in mind, now this is the end of the night. I'm beat, I didn't done a full radio show that day. I didn't done a full day of family feud and you're on your feet all day and I'm walking up to him steps. And it's, and I call them that thank you Jesus steps. And I say it every time because the house I live in, I actually, I actually professed that house. I got halfway up to those steps and turned around and looked back at the fountain and I said, man, one day, one day, I'm going to get a fountain like that. And for a call, I'll visit and buddy of mine at that house. Really? Yeah. And I stopped and I turned around. He said, man, stop, I can crazy. Come on, I said, man, you got to be kidding me, man. And that's the house I live in today. But you used to visit that house. I used to visit that house. I saw the house when it was being built. I was, I was a part of it. And I saw that house when it was being built. And I told my wife, I said one day and she told me, she said, see, not this house. We can't do this. We're going down sides when the kids move. Well, I ain't never believed in downsides. And I don't know what downsides in this for. Because I don't know how you get God to give you more and then you give it back. I ain't never been into that. Like I don't do cutbacks. They're just saying my thing. I had a guy on my show of Clark Howard and this ain't nothing negative. But just, he's just on the show. Just kept telling everybody how to cut back. You know, cut your cable off to save money. Instead of driving your car to work car poo. And I sent that for about a month. I listened to that and I just couldn't take it no more. Because I'm doing the cutback business. I'm in the, if God blessed me, I like to keep the blessing. So I don't really cut back. I'm a wife told me we was going down sides. And that was the first major argument we ever had, because I'm not in the downsides and business. Yeah, they didn't seem like your personality. I don't see wife, really. I really don't see a wife. What's the cremvious place you've ever lived? I mean, you think back to the, can you think of the cremvious place you've ever lived? Yeah, my car. Yeah, what kind of car wasn't? A temple, a temple, four, a temple, four, a temple. Yeah. I don't suppose it was new. Oh, no. That would've been nice. I lived in that and I lived in a Bonneville. I had two cars. I lived in Beaufort. That was the worst place. I, when I think back in a poorest place, I've lived as a house I grew up in. But at the time, I didn't know that. It was poor for the course. It was one of the houses on the block. Everybody lived like that. So I thought it was, I thought this how you live. You 13 people in one bathroom room. You're not thought that was it. But because you didn't know any different at the time. No. Because I was saying, well, I grew up poor. But at the time, if you've never ridden anything, but at 58 Volkswagen, if you've never been in a Cadillac, you don't know the difference, right? You don't know you got a bad deal. You think this is the way it is. Hey, who went to church in 1968, Bell Last Stationway? And that was my first car in 75. My daddy gave me a 1968 Bell Last Stationway. And that was my first car. Hey, it was a car went to church in it. So. You were born in West Virginia. Yeah. And it was, that was not a real affluent time in your life. But there were 70, all right? How many kids were in your family? It was five kids. Five kids. Seven kids. There were seven in the family. Yeah. Did everybody work in contribute when you were growing up? Yeah, that was a must. Wouldn't have free rise in my daddy house. He didn't. Yeah. Like, you know, when you, like, we didn't have a lot of things tough like that. We had to work. Yeah. I've had a, I've had paper routes. And, and pop bottle hustles every since I was 10. So I've wondered many times if that's the reason you and I got along so well, so fast. Because we've talked about just before and I threw paper routes. I picked up pop bottles and you get a nickel for some and you get a dime for others. Yeah. And put them together. And we've had some of those same experiences. I don't know about you, but I would not want my kids to go through that. But I don't mind that I did. I mean, it's okay with me that I went through that at the time. I wouldn't want to do it again. Yeah. But, and I wouldn't want my kids to do it. But I don't regret it. Now, I mean, you know, look, man, it made us who we were. I mean, you know, you look at everything you've gone through. I used to oftentimes question God all the time, man. Why is my life like this? You know, as I got older when I was a kid, it wasn't the question. This was what it was. But when I got older and homeless and all, like, that's just as God, what is this about, man? I mean, look, come on. Enough is enough. But everything you're going through is preparing you for what's to come. You and I needed the pop bottle moments, the paper routes. You and I needed that. So we could become who we are. Now we grew up and we don't want our children to have that. So we work doubly hard. So they don't have to go through the same things that we went through. And then that's a challenge I find for a lot of people who are doing better now. Because you give so much to your kids that they miss some of them valuable lessons that you had to learn along the way. And then you start thinking to yourself, well, did I give them too much? What's the cutoff point? And I rattle with that all the time with my kids. Because my kids didn't fight on the way. My kids went to school with a jacket that had a patch on it. With the blue shirt and uniforms. They got the merits. And they went to detention. And it was over with for me. Schools over with for me, my detention that the mayor was somebody had to demere it waiting on me in the playground. Because when the bail rang, I'm kicking some tail. And yours is it today? Well, my kids didn't have to go through that because they had a room with a bathroom with it. They owned bathroom. Yeah, they're owned bathroom. Yeah. Well, you know, I, one of the things that you told me long time ago, we actually talked about it on on microphone one time that has stuck with me. And I've told a lot of people about it. You had, when you got older and got out into comedy, you told me about what you called your turnback moment. When you, you were living in an addict. And it was a turnback moment that, and I wish you would talk about that a little bit. Because it seems to me that you were within hours of having to go back home and get back into an hourly job instead of going to the Apollo. Because no, look man, I said it before. Everybody, I don't kill who you are is going to have that turnback moment. Everybody is on path on track to a destination. Everybody, everybody has a dream. Everybody, nobody is without dreams and visions. But somewhere along that dream of vision, you're going to have a moment where you can either continue or you turn back. The sad truth of the matter is too many people turn back. My turnback moment was I was out there doing comedy. I was homeless. I wasn't going good man. And I just had had enough that day. And I was washing up in a hotel. And I was in there and I used to go to fancy hotels to wash up because they had actual wash clothes rolled up in a little basket. And I used to wet them and take them in the toilet and put soap all over my body. And I went to the coasts clear and I went to the coasts clear and I went to the mountain and go back in there and wipe off and then put my clothes on. And that was my bath. Well, that morning, a convention was in town. When I got to soap, I went in there to soap up. A convention was in town and I guess they had let out for a break and people just kept coming in the bathroom and I'm sitting there. And I got this soap on me and it's drying. And I can't get back out there to get no fresh, get no fresh cloths to wash. And the soap is drying on me and I flipped the toilet lid down and I sat there and I just started crying. I said, this is it man. I just can't do this no more. This comedy thing ain't working out. I ain't making enough money to take care of my family. I'm gonna call my father. I'm gonna call my father told me once you leave here, you can't come back home. Call my own man and just cut a deal with him. See if he let me come back home for six months and get me a regular job. Let me give up on this comedy thing. And so when they're bathroom finally cleared out, I was able to wash off. I went to get in the car and before I called my daddy, I had an answering machine up in the attic at my mother and father's house. They let me plug up and I called that answering machine and I was just about to give up and I said, I called the machine and it said, hey, this is Chuck Sutton from Show Time with your Apollo. I saw a tape of you and I was wondering if you can make it to New York on Sunday and I put you on TV. Your funny guy hoped to hear from you. Click. This was a Thursday. I'm in Pensacola, Florida. I got 35 dollars and the Apollo theaters in Harlem, New York. I got no way I'm gonna make this geek. I'm gonna be able to get there. And all of this time, man, I've been wanting to be on TV since I was a kid. Here's this TV moment and I can't even get there. And man, I was devastated. I said, God, look at this guy to be a sign from God, show enough to give up now. Because I get to one crack to be on TV and I can't even get there. So I set out in the car, man, and tears is just coming down my face, man. I'm just sitting here going. Let me go and call my father. Now, went back and I said, man, let me call him and make sure he didn't say this Sunday. And I call back, hey, this is Chuck Sutton from Showtime at the Apollo Man. I saw you take me really funny guy. I got an open-knit on Showtime at the Apollo Sunday night of you can make it. Please give him a call, man, you're funny guy. Click. I said, I'll be dull going. It's this Sunday. And I was about to hang up and you know, the old fashioned machines, they said, poop, it beat the game. So I picked up the phone. He says Steve Harvey, this is Tom sober from the comedy Caravan. I don't know where you are, but I got to gig and jack some vehicle floated, it pays 150 bucks. If you can get there, the gig is Friday night. I'll pay 150 bucks. Let me know. I call Tom sober said, man, I can get there. So I got there Friday night. I made the 150 bucks. I performed. I was so good. The club owner said, hey, can you stick around tomorrow night? I pay another 150. I got $300 now. I get on that phone and I call Showtime at the Apollo Chuck said, and I say, hey, man, you still got that opening. He said, yeah, I got that opening, man. I said, I'll be there. Eastern Airlines was in business back then, because $99. Flopher, Jacksonville, New York, I called it $99. The flight my first time ever on TV Showtime at the Apollo. I still got to shirt. I still got to tape. I walked out. I got a stand in Ovation. I'm backstage. I'm crying. I can't stop crying. I'm been on TV. And I thought about it. And the reason I couldn't stop crying because two days ago, I was finna turn back. Two days ago, I was finna call my daddy and give up. Two days ago, had that happened. I'm not here talking to you today. And that turned back moment, man, that gave me the faith and understand and really how God works. See, if you quit, it'll never happen for you. But if you're hanging there, you don't know who in God going flip the switch. And he flipped the switch, right? Because he saw me finna call. He knew I was serious. He said, this dude finna give up. Let me rescue him. But he had orchestrated the whole thing. And I didn't turn back. And that moment changed my life. Because when I got on TV, on showtime to Apollo, that was to be getting everything. Man, I've been on TV every six. But you hung in. I mean, you hung in and you didn't do it. And that 300 bucks, you could have taken that and gone home. No, I did that. Yeah. But you know, man, that's why I say to people all the time. Quit and guarantee you one thing. It ain't going to happen. That's the guarantee of quitting. Hang in there. Resides this little thing that's required. All you need is a check the hope. The hope. Faith is the substance of things hopeful and the evidence of things not seen. All you just hope, that's all faith is. It's just really hope. And the harder you hope, the more faith you got, the more faith you have, the more faith you have. But you got to put a lot of elbow grease with it too. I want to ask you, well, let's take a quick break. And then I've got to ask you a question that plays right into what you're saying. Let me do a commercial here. And it's about something I want to tell you that Stephen, I have in common here in just a minute. And I want to do a shameless plug again from Merit Street Media because it is a new network where the rubber meets the road. This isn't just a new network. It is a revolution in common sense television. And it is straight from the heart of America to you. Look, this is a network that's founded on the principles of meritocracy. And that's just what you heard Steve Harvey talking about before we took this break. Meritocracy, rewarding hard work, rewarding hanging in there. And it's the spirit of Main Street. We're here to deliver content that speaks to you about you and for you. And Dr. Phil Primetime is just the beginning. We're rolling out the red carpet for shows that cover every angle of life as we know it, from family and relationships to the burning issues that are shaping our world today. And if you're ready for television, that's as real as you are. It's time to tune in to Merit Street Media. Because this is just our story. This isn't just our story to tell. It's yours too. This isn't just my network. This is our network. Let's make television that matters. And let's make it together. I want you to discover a whole new era in television with Merit Street Media. This isn't like a lot of other networks where there's one show. And then you go to the next show. And they don't have any to do with each other. We've created a whole new ecosystem here where the news is involved with my show. And my show is involved with Nancy Grace's show. And Nancy Grace's show is involved with the behavior panel. I mean, all the shows are involved with each other. And Steve Harvey is going to have something to say about that in a few minutes. I bet. So to get involved, go to MeritStreatMedia.com to find your local channels. There's a channel finder there. And you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. This is a passion for me. And I think when you tune in, you're going to see why. But I don't want you to just tune in. I want you to call everybody you know and tell them about it. I've written a new book called We've Got Issues, How to Stand Strong for America Soul and Sanity. And it is the blueprint for this entire network. It's a blueprint for our news. It's a blueprint for Dr. Phil Primetime. It's a blueprint for everybody involved in this network because we have shared values. And I think you'll share them too when you tune in. Now, Steve, you were talking about faith being just hope and real hard. But you put action with that too. And you said you wouldn't be sitting here today if it wasn't for that. You know I've been friends for a long time, right? And I said before we talked about some things that we can't really talk about with anybody else because there are very many people that do what we do. I mean, we're both out there every day. We're in people's homes every day. People feel like they know us because we're in their home every day. You're in my home almost all day every day. I think you were in my house one time. I pulled up the record guide. I think we had what 430 episodes of Family Feud recorded. Because Robin just records them all. And watch us them all. And people see you. And I mean, you're, you have a great gift for humor and banner with people. You go back and forth with them. That's why Family Feud is, it's got to be the most successful game show like that ever. I mean, I don't know if anything else has had the longevity you've brought to it, the energy, everything that you've brought to it. Because you're just authentic with the people. Right? I mean, you don't really know, you don't have a clue what you're going to say when you walk out there. Because you don't know what they're going to say. You just let yourself kind of come through. And that's a big part of all the comedy you've ever done. I've seen your stand up. I've seen your concerts. I've seen everything you do. And you have comedy that you work out where the beats are timed. And they're exactly what they need to be. But a big part of it is you just interacting with the audience. Where do you get the confidence to do that? I don't know if it's the confidence as more so is just though. I mean, look, man, authenticity is a big part of our brand. Mine and yours. I think that's a big part of our friendship over the years. It's authenticity. I couldn't believe it was another dude in the business that was just what real dude. You couldn't believe it was another dude in the business. That was just a real dude. Because you know what we want to be into out here. Oh, yeah. You got your brand manager, you got your PR person, you got your attorney. You got all these people being stuffed to their toll to be. You ain't never been that. And I ain't never been that. I, you know, I, they call me a country bumpkin in all. Like, well, what you, I'm from what's what's Virginia, what you want me to be? Yeah. Well, what, what's what you want me to do? You know, you can't, I'm not finished speaking grammatically correct. I got high school diploma. That was it. Graduate in class of 695. I graduated 690. Yeah. So you weren't after bottom? No, no, no, no. And five people out after me. I gave them the blues when I saw them too. I tried to encourage them, you know, hanging at the dog, you know, you could 694 and ride around the corner. You know, I tried to be on the moment. But it was an authenticity, man. I just can't fake the funk, man. I don't, I don't like that. I can't hold the line. You know what I mean? And if I'm out here faking, man, I'm not going to be able to hold the line. I ain't going to be already know that. Because the real me going to come out. See, it's starting to funny, man. Like, if I don't like you, I just, I just stay on the other side. And just, me and you don't need to talk. Because it's going to come out. Because I'm not going to be able to hide the fact that I don't care for you. Because the moment you say some contrary to what I'm going to hear, didn't hear it come. I'm going to let you have it right in the teeth. And I've always been that way. So I just wanted to stay authentically me. And I think people responded to that. I noticed why you've been on TV for so long, man. I told you, but my favorite moment on TV, I was watching your on TV talk to this guy. And you just frustrated with this dude. And he was just whining. I'm like, man, man. And you just say, man, you're just, you're going to have to man up. And I went, okay. Oh, you could feel the brakes going. You just saw, you're okay. He's going to get some calls on that one right there. You fined again. So a lot of emails coming in. Dr. Fielding insulted him by telling him he needed to man up. Well, really, man, that made all the sense in the world of me. And that's pretty much how I try to be. When I turned that corner at family feud, like you said, I never met these people. I don't know who they are. I try to be relatable. But if I can't relate, I'm just going to tell you that part, too. It was interesting to me in watching that unfold. Because if you remember, you and Marjorie were at our house the night you had to make the decision of whether to do family feud or not. Yeah. You were thinking about talking about it. We were back in my office. Discussing. Wow. And that was a night. It was a deadline. You had to tell him whether you're going to do it or not. Yeah. And they were pushing you hard. And we talked about the fact that the game show, the game part of it. That's part of it. Like you said, it's a survey. But it gave you a chance to just be you. The game is just a backdrop. It was just a platform for you to be who you are. And let them keep score. You just go down the line. And you just, it's like you work in the front row of a comedy show. Right. That's all it is. You know, man, family feud, a huge part of his success is, I, I turned it into a comedy show instead of a guy. And nobody had ever done that with a game show. A game show has a set format, and that's it. Family feud is a game about a survey. Top 100 people survey said, here would they think, well, who care? I'm, you know, and I'll tell you what was making me have that trouble at your house that night. They had sent me a tape of the guy before me. And the question was, do you send me a tape for me to see the show? Name your favorite pet, and the guy said a cow. And the whole said, well, let's see if it's up there. And I said to myself, here you talking about, what do you mean, let's see if it's up there? Cow. You want to say it, doll, puppy cat, chicken fish, bird turtle. You know, some people got, who got a cow walking around, they live in room? I said, well, I said, so why would I do that? The lady said, you would say that to the contestant? Yeah, I'm not going to turn and say, let's see if it's up there. The first of all, I know what ain't up there. And that's second, ladies find out why you thought that ignorant answer would be up here. She said, you can't make disparaging remarks against the contestant. Watch me. I said, ladies, you, what you bring me down here for? You know who I am, you see my tapes? I don't make disparaging remarks. Lady, I'm an observational humorist expert. I made an observation that you say in a stupid answer. What I do is I now say what everybody had to house this thinking. And that's what I did. And man, they told me that won't happen. I said it your house didn't I? I said, really, I don't know man. And you told me you said, man, why don't you just go in there and be you? Yeah. And I said, okay, and then I took the gig and that was it. That was it. Seven, seven time Emmy winner. New York Times, number one bestselling author, act like a lady, think like a man. 64 times on New York Times best seller list. 23 of those at number one, two Marconi Awards for Radio, 14 NAACP Image Awards, BET humanitarian Award. I know you got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame because I gave it to you. Yes. People's Choice Award, induction into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. You've taken that authenticity and it's obvious people respond to that. All that from a country, all that from a country bumpkin, a ball headed country bumpkin. You stupid, heck. Okay. I ain't gonna tell you how many trips now I did to bank, I made. We'll eat that alone. We just last all the way to bank. Bro, they're taking some, somebody asked me one time they said, Steve, how come you don't respond to the haters? Listen man. First of all, haters don't stop nothing. They are not decision makers, power brokers. They don't stop nothing man. And they don't pay your rent. Bro. And I've learned so many things. Do you know what I've known and you've noticed and this is for everybody watching. You've never ever had a hater that was doing better than you. Yep. No doubt about it. Ever. All you want that wouldn't change places with you in a heartbeat. Bro, someone people don't want, man, why don't you respond? I wish I would. Stop and take my light and shine and on your little bit of self. You want aunt, cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, feeling. Bro, you go ahead on. You ain't even corn. So I wish I would stop. Man, I don't have no problem. Matter of fact, now you know, man, I'm so battle tested with the internet now. You know, me and you was talking about that and how TikTok is running the airways now. And the reason I know about TikTok, because I work with a lot of young people. And they were all this TikTok. One of them sitting over there right there. He's the TikTok King. He's the King of TikTok. Oh, all of his news coming from TikTok. Yeah. Well, then you know it's right. Because you have some TikTok, you know it's right. Right. He didn't have been about eight died players off TikTok. Yeah. Been at work where we couldn't find it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, here's the thing. I'll tell people this and then you can tell them why. We've been talking about merit street media. The new network that we launched today. Which is why we're celebrating with kicking the Bill and the Blank's podcast back off with this live broadcast. But Steve Harvey, if you don't know, is part of the merit street media family. In fact, he's an equity partner in merit street media. He and I are partners in the network here. And I called Steve some time ago and said, hey, let me tell you what I'm doing. And you need to come do this with me. And I described it to him. And what do you think when I called you about this? Well, honestly, man. Yeah. I mean, first of all, I was flawed because I mean, y'all, look, look at me. Just to feel, cause you. Dr. Phil McGraw, that's who y'all called. I call him, it's silly. Phil calls me. You know his track record, you know what he does. And he says, hey, man, you know me and you, we've been friends for a long time. I got something for you. I want you to come with me. I want you to be an equity partner in this deal with me. And I want you to, this is what we're going to do. We're going to open up a TV network. And we're going to produce TV. And I want you to have a place where you can bring content and ideas and how you really think and feel. I want you to come do it. And I went, I went, okay, first of all, are you joking? I think you got to be kidding me, right? Okay, you called me. And so first, I'm thinking, okay, okay. First, you know, hit a crazy part. I know you didn't need no money. That was so that was cool. I was relaxed right there because this ain't a dude that, you know, Phil, we don't have to relate to it. You know how you got people call your house. And you go, uh, what the hell they want. He don't want no money. So I said, okay, then I thought about it. Then I said, so what are you saying, man? I said, hey, man, can you send me something over? I'm within five minutes. He sent over a whole presentation. I mean, it was so complete. Pictures of the studio. He was building and what it was going to look like when it was finished. And I said, is this dude for real? So, Phil, you just want me to join in with you. He said, man, I ain't thinking nobody else you it. You it. And I hung the phone up. I called my wife. I said, babe, I just got a call from Phil. He said, how's Rob been doing? They ain't talking about that right now. Listen to him. Rob and had on some shoes all the day, I was going, what the go on with this? What's happening? And next thing, you know, I said, this is what he want me to do. She said, okay. So when you're going out there, I said, baby, you, I'm just, this is what I'm going to do. She said, Steve, when you, it's doctor, what, what, what you want me to tell you? You know me stupid things you've done. And I went, that's where you're going to go with it now. And so that was it. And then he sent a stuff over and I couldn't believe it, man. And all honesty, this is what you call favor. This is man when you're going along and God just do a solid for you. This one, you just, this is, see, I can't give nobody credit for this. It's up God because it was no doing a man. I didn't call you. I say, he's really what you're working on now. I got to call out of nowhere, it was you, look, we see each other on vacation. We sit and I'm talking. Just do just call me and just, here I want to do this with you. And I was just, I was honored, man. Really, really just honored. Well, and the reason I called you, and as I've said to you, nobody else. There's not anybody else on the list. Is this you and me? I mean, that's it. Because I said, I take this real serious. And there is, you and I have a very, a line value system from the very beginning. And I'm just going to sound like mutual admiration society for a few minutes here. But people know you from what you do and what they see on the air. But I know you as a real person. I know you as a husband and a father and a real person away from the camera and who you are and what you believe and what you've struggled to overcome. And I know who you are and I know how much you have to offer to this country and keeping this country on track and online. And I didn't name this network by accident. I didn't reach into a bag and pull out a name, merit. This is merit street media. As you know, and I think this country is built on hard work and talent and added value. And I know that about you. I've known that about you for years and years and years. And it's not about being a victim. It's about second it up and doing what you got to do to get ahead. And that defines you. You and I've talked about it a hundred times. And I know what kind of father you are. I know what kind of family man you are. I know, you know, I've seen you in March. We vacation together. We've had serious conversations. We've problems off together. We've fought them off at the gates together. Yeah. You know, so I thought this is somebody that we have shared life experiences and shared values. And I said, man, this is somebody that I'll go into Fox Hole with. And that's why I picked up a phone call to you. And man, I appreciate you know, man, you talk about how things have gone in this country and everything. You know, look, man. It amazes me because I'm a middle guy. The symbol for this country is an eagle, right? Right. All the foreign eagle and fly proper. You got to have a right wing and a left wing. I don't go all the way with what nobody say. I don't. I'm not really the far right guy. And I show it to fall left guy. You know, because I like to get it man where I care about my family. I care about my grandchildren. I care about my kids man. And I'm trying to figure out the world that they're going to be in. And if we keep going at the pace we're going. Got to taste something my son, Linder, was really kind of crazy to me. You know, because we have the issue now. We got all this pro now picking right. That's cool. But this was a guy I saw this online that really kind of made me a laugh, but it threw me. Had a little boy in front of this table and they put two Oreo cookies in front of me and put $500 on the other side and told us little boy to pick. All the boys looking at them cookies and looking at $500 and let me tell you something. He was ripped open. I mean, he was good at it because he didn't cook it. And that 500. He couldn't quite figure it out. So they doubled down and they put four Oreo cookies in front of me $1000. I saw this little boy. He had made up his mind. The ripping was over. It's a done deal. Damn it. Fococcus. He picked them for cookies. He was through. He was solved it for me. The money on the cookies. And then a lady came up and said, and this is why kids don't need to be picking a sex at school. And I laughed, but that hit me like a hammer man. I'm gonna say, what are we going with all this? Hold up man. We got slow down a little bit. Because this little boy clearly took them for cookies. He's a thousand. It's a thousand was right here. You don't know the thousand. You could have bought how many packs of cookies. You could have got a bike. Boy, you could have got your sister new school. You could have bought the girl down and straight some cookies. You could have bought the girl and scout box of cookies. You know how many girls you had after that? That boy picked them for cookies. And I said, man, that's what we got to start thinking about. And you know, man, I'm okay with everybody making whatever decisions they want to make. But you got to be okay when somebody has a counter now. You got to be okay with a counter too. You know, if you've free to think and feel, that's fine and then. But you got to be open to the counter now. Because you can't publicly think and feel one way and expect publicly not to be thought of another way. And I just kind of look at stuff like that man. And I think it's a fair to be able to talk about stuff like that and say it out loud without like you say, without cancellation. Because I'm trying to cancel nobody. You and a dope person, man. Do you, but we got to take a shot, look at where we let in our kids go. Well, I couldn't agree more. And I think that we're in a real bad spot when we can't ask questions without getting labeled as a hater or some kind of foe. We're in a real bad spot when we have people so afraid to speak there. Mind or ask questions or disagree for fear that they're going to get canceled. And I always thought about college is somewhere you went to hear other ideas. Or you went to the town square back in the old days where you had different points of you and you went to hear what they were. Now that's not the case. If somebody disagrees, they get shouted down. They call it the Hechler's veto. They're going to shut you down where they don't hear the other side. And what I want to do at Merit Street is I want us to own the debate lane. Look, this is where you can come to talk about both sides of an issue and then let people make up their own mind. Yeah. That's what I want our news department to do. You know, you turn on one cable news and you hear everything on the right wing. You're on the other hand, you hear everything. And left wing. Here's a novel approach. Let's tell people what happened and shut up. Just tell them what happened and then shut up. Let them make up their mind about whether it's good news or bad news. It's an insult to people. We don't need to tell people what to think. We need to tell people how to think. We don't teach kids how to think anymore. We don't teach critical thinking. Let's teach kids how to think. Instead of what to think. Let them decide what they think. Let's just teach them how to do critical thinking. Let them decide what to do. They don't need to be told what to think. That's what's happening in college right now. We're teaching kids what to think instead of how to think. We need to teach them how to go through the thought process. That's what's important. Yeah. Yeah, man. I just want to be able to look, man. If you have a different sub-appinion from me, I'm fine with that. I'm really, really cool with that, man. You don't have to think like me. I ain't got to think like you either. And hold on, man. I'm going to allow you to say what you want to say. But can I not be allowed to say what I want to say? Now, what I want to say is not lined up with you. Why I got to bite the bullet? Why you got to cancel my show? Because it didn't line up with what you said. That's the trouble that we have in right now, man. And it seems like that cancellation thing is winning right now. Yeah, but I think you're starting to be a swing back. And I certainly hope that's the case. Must go to do another commercial here. All right. This is live. So I got to do another commercial across this great country. From coast to coast, you've told me about the crossroads we're facing. What Steve was just talking about. That's exactly why I wrote. We've got issues. How you can stand strong for America's soul insanity. Now, this book isn't just a conversation starter. It's a road map for standing strong in the face of adversity. For embracing our core values when they're needed most. Now, we're talking about real strategies for real people dealing with real issues. And I'm talking about from navigating the complexities of today's polarized world to fortifying our families. And I really think that families in America are under attack right now. So we've got to really focus on strengthening our families. And I set forth in the book 10 principles that I think are critical for a healthy society. This is not about politics. I'm not a politician. Don't want to be a politician. Don't know enough about politics to talk about it. I think most people that talk about politics don't know enough about politics to talk about it. I'm just willing to admit it. I don't know enough about it. So I don't. But I talk about cultural issues because I do know about that. And I think that if people want to have a conversation about that, this is a place for them to go. And we're going to be, you and I are going to be doing a lot of things that I think impact the family. We've got one great project coming up that I love. We're going to be doing a thing that you've been at for a long time. We're just going to put it on television and hopefully inspire people because you work with young men that don't have fathers in their world. They don't have fathers in their life. And we're going to do. We're going to shoot a retreat about that. We're going to do that in Georgia. Yeah, you're going to do that at my ranch down in Georgia. It's going to be a great man because it this is what I need. Because I need people to understand the severity. Like we talk about, you know, it's one thing to discuss a problem. It's a whole other thing provide a solution for it, right? You know, if you work for me and you come to me and you go, well Mr. Harvey, we have an problem right here. If you don't have to fix for it, please don't bring me the problem. Please don't do that to me. Because I got enough. I got stuff stacked up to here. If I just want to hear what's going wrong, I don't need you to come in here unless you have a fix. We have a problem with our young men today. My, my foundation has worked with young girls, Marjorie does the girls and I do the boys. And this is my 14th or 15th year doing this. And we, I've done over 3000 young men at the ranch personally. I've done 3 million virtually, every since COVID. 3 million young men. I've done 3000 lives that I bring to my ranch. And what I do is I bring young men to my ranch who don't have active fathers in their life. So, they're from single parent homes headed up by women because I know the daunting tasks that women have in raising a young boy. Because how do you get this woman to possibly turn this boy into a man? That's got to be tough when you've never been one. So I offer my assistance. And I mean, I get thousands and thousands of requests every year. This year will have 300 boys. Our TV network is coming down there this year. It'll be the week leading up to father's day weekend. I picked father's day because they don't have them. And I bring a lot of men down there. It's all men volunteers, all male speakers to put the image in front of these young boys they need. And I teach them two things in the five days that I have them. First of all, a flying ball in that coming from 15 different cities this year. I fly them all in a housing. I put them up. I feed them and I clothing. Now, these young boys learn two things. The principles of manhood and dream building. And, you know, I got some pushback from certain corporations. What about the education? Hold on my man. Some of these kids go to college. Some of these kids go to the army. Some of these kids go work at home. Where and loads. I got all types of stuff. That ain't my job. I'm trying to say these young boys lives. I'm trying to turn boys. I'm trying to turn these boys into better men. And if I can teach them the principles of manhood to get them to understand who it. That manhood is not a video in any chain. It ain't to size the old rooms. It ain't some girls in the background shaking. That ain't got nothing to do with manhood. Real men go to work. Real men obey the law. Real men love God. Real men respect women. Real men go to work every day. See, I got to get that in their head. And if you give them to me for five days, I got a program that's set in stone that is proven to have maximized results. I have turned out of this program. Young men who are in the military. Young men who are managers in department stores. I've turned out young men who are engineers. I've got ministers from this program. I've got young men who are in medical school. I've got so many college students. I've got the track record to show you that if you put a dream in front of these young boys and teach them how to dream. See, the dream will inspire you to get an education. That's the problem we have. See, we keep beating these boys over the head. Come on, go to school, go to school. Why? Why? Let's talk about the dream. I had a young boy four years ago came to the camp and told me he won't defy our planes. He was a D student. Today is young men as a pilot. Because once you told me that you won't defy planes, I put some pilots in front of him. I got him to go down and get on the airplane with some pilots. And they talked to him where he found out. I got to do better in school because I'm not need to be good at science and math. Because I put the dream in front of him. I got boys. I had two boys that was gang bangers. And these cats was at it, man. There's crypts in the bloods. And these two boys are couldn't separate you. Dude, man. Every time they saw each other, them two little color rigs was at it. Now, one of the little boys I couldn't save. And I can't tell you where he is today. But one of the young boys come back to the camp. He's one of my top junior counselor. And he's an engineer today. Well, see, I ain't gonna save everybody. I ain't no miracle work. But the church ain't saving everybody either. So, hello. But I can get most of these boys on track. And out of the 3000 that's come to the camp. Out of the 3000, I've only lost one. Well, who just wouldn't stay at the camp. And when you come down there, there's some of field. And you bring these cameras. And we get a real light on this. Maybe somebody would turn around and help me with this. Because I spent a lot of money on this ranch. Myself, Marjorie and Bartit, and donated it to the foundation for $1. So I could change these boys, lives down in Barnesville, Georgia. And you know, look, I got a build. Some dormitories right now. I put up temporary housing with tents. And I bring in the, of VIP shower. And all like this, you see on movie sets. So they can get up. But I got a build. Dormatory is down there. I got a build a theater down there. I want to build a STEM center down there. I want to build a gymnasium. But you bring them cameras. Maybe some people understand what they're doing. Yeah. I do want people to see it. We got a video of any of this. Let's roll it. Let's go. This is what I live for. This one God made before. I'm living my first. All that frame for you. I live for this. So I could teach somebody else. I'd do what I did. Or I saw you over there. Yeah. How many boys at the time? Two, two, three hundred each year. Each year. All at the same time. All at the same time. It's a truck load man. And how old are they? From 13 to 18. 13 to 18. And how do they, how do they sign up? How do you pick the ones that come? Well, they write a letter. Uh-huh. They write a letter. You know, that lets us know if they really interested in. Sometimes, you know, the ones I pick. I pick mostly trouble youth. You know, we got some straight A students down there. Just don't have a father active in their life. And then I got some cats and they doing well at all. That's usually who I pick. I want that little boy that looked like that they trying to write him off and tell him he ain't gonna be nothing. Because I heard that before. And that's what we get. Yeah. And how long do they stay? They stay about four days for that. And they're all I need to ingrain them. See, it's real easy man. Because to get to a boy, I know the way. First of all, I want to know what you're dreaming about. And then I want to know what type of girl you want. See, once I find that out. And then I start telling you what this girl going on. And then that's going to tell you what you're going to need to do. I have they undivided attention. Because I know what it's done. It's real simple. You got to get down the basics. Like you talked about all the time. You talked about common sense TV. See, y'all good they going about this and wrong way. You know man, if schools would implement a dream building course, they could save they self a lot of trouble. Yeah. If you could ask the kids, what do you dream about? You got to stop and talk to your kid every four months about what they dream about. If you talk to them about what they dream about, what they really want in life, you have their attention. But you can't keep beating them over the head. But you got to go to school. You got to get your lesson. Get your lesson. It was, I don't have a lesson. Now, what are you talking about? My mom, we poor. We can't even eat right now. These lights resolved. I mean, that's what they deal with dealing with some real situation. And then you get out here in this world and you got Instagram and TikTok showing the flash and presans a life without showing what's really happening. And these kids try to find a shortcut to that, to that meal ticker. And then they won't. No, I'm not, listen. I'll talk to so many of these gang bangers. Now, I've talked to some that have been really up in the hierarchy of the gangs and a few that have gotten out. And they tell me straight up that when they hear me say the number one need in all people is acceptance, that that's what the gangs use to turn these kids' heads. They don't have fathers in the home. They don't feel a sense of belonging. And that's what the gang sell. They say, hey, listen, we got your back. We love you. You belong here. And here's this big authority figure that's real powerful to them. And they say, hey, we love you. We'll protect you. This is a family. You belong here. We accept you. And I mean, it's right or die. I mean, they say, I'm in. And that's how they motivate them. And if somebody will give them an alternative, if somebody will say, look, what's your passion? Let me help you chase your passion. Let me help you go after that. But a kid that doesn't have a dream, doesn't have a passion, doesn't have hope. How do you ever expect to motivate that young man? You've got to have, I say that to adults too. If you don't have a passion in your life, what a horrible existence. If there's nothing you're passionate about in your life, can you imagine? I would that be to get up every day. And it just be going through the motions, just gray. Every day, the same is the last. Yeah, man. Nothing you're excited about. Nothing you're passionate about. What a terrible way to live. It is. And you know, my one of the things that helped me is see, I bring back kids who have graduated from the program to help me with these kids that sleep in the barracks with them. So when I'm not with them, they go on, hey, man, listen to me. What this man saying is right, this is how you get out. I bring ex gang bangers down to talk to the boys. You know, but I tell you, man, I had to police in that one time. I had to police talking to the boys. Oh, who? They was, they was, they were, because they some, they, they some tough kids. Yeah. And I wanted the questions to the police officers. We here to serve and protect. And a handful of boys kept raising their hand. Why y'all keep killing us, don't they? Why y'all kill us. And that's a conversation that had to be had. And well, all police don't do that. You have the news, this is what we're doing. This is what we see. And this is what we saw before. You know, that was phone cameras and stuff like that out there too. So it's a real conversation that we have in dealing with real life, man, with some real solutions to it. And you coming there to some of them and going to be a big shot in the arm. I really believe that man. Well, I can't wait to do it. And I'm excited to do it. I'm excited to meet these young men. I'm excited to turn the cameras on and let people see the amazing work that you're doing and get people to step up and support it. I mean, that's what we want. We want people to make it where you can not work with 300 boys, but you can work with 3000 boys. So that's what you want to do. That you can have the facilities and do what it, what you want to do to show them that there's something else in life besides what they come from. Because I mean, some of them come where hope is just, I mean, it's just a word. Bro, you don't want to highlight. It was last year for me. Wanted to guys, it came back. He's a minister. He came back. And he was having prayer out in the lodge with about 50 at a boy's. And I don't know what was going on out there. And he just had him in the circle praying. And I'm looking at the kid. And I didn't recognize him. But I wouldn't pay any attention because it's so many kids come through the camp. Sometimes they drive down. I don't even ask him. It's hard. I was here four years ago. I know it's camp time. I just came down. And for this dude to be doing that, and then helping these cats out, man, it's just such a moving thing. And the program works, man. And you know, look, man. And you know how it is. Hard to ask for money when you rich. You've tried that. You've tried to ask for some money in you rich, man. That's a funky conversation. What? Because first of all, everybody, when you talk and the whole room is doing this here, because they think you got it. Why don't you give it some more? Well, nobody wants to factor in the effort. You know, I have 100 employees. Like I pay. And I have pay for the ranch. And I have pay for this food, and all this here. And then I got a company to run. And I got some employees. It's waiting on the check. And they just think it's a bottomless pit of money. So it's kind of hard. And then I'm not that, I'm not that guy either. It's really hard for me to, because of my pride level. Because I've been pulling myself up by the bootstraps a long time. It's just that I don't ran up into. I know 300 boys that just need boots right now. Yeah. Skips, I skip to straps. Yeah. And people either help or they won't. And if they think it's not the right thing to do, it's not the right thing to do. But we'll ask anyway, because the boys deserve it. And you can't do it for everybody. You only do so much. And then you got to get some help. And so we'll ask for some help. I'm never thought I could do everything by myself. You can't do everything by yourself. But those people that want to help will help. And those that don't won't. But I think when they see what's happening here, they're going to be part of that. Maybe they give their time, maybe they give their money, whatever. But we're going to give them a chance to see what's going on. That's good work. The thing I love about this conversation is people love you. They love your persona. They love your comedy. They love the way you deal with people. And that you always interact with them and never in a mean spirit. And why even if you're cutting up with them, Joe can make him fun or whatever. You're always fast to make sure you're the butt of the joke. Instead of it, somebody else has experienced. But I love for people to get to see another side of you. And know what you're really all about. And the depth and caring that you have and how deep Steve Harvey runs. Because Steve Harvey runs deep. And I'm glad for people to get to see that. And I'm glad to get a chance to pull the curtain back and let them see who you really are. I appreciate you letting me do it, man. This is my calling, man. I'm in the calling part of my life, man. I took me a while to get here. And now I made good money, man. I've had it. I've got a great career. You know, we're going to do some wonderful things. Still got some more to come. But it's all gotten me to this point right here. My purpose is my mama used to tell me something. When I was little and I didn't get it. She said, son, one day, God, I'm going to give you a big house up on the heel. You can't get up on the heel and don't tell nobody else how to get that. I ain't know what she's talking about back there. I got it now. That's what mentoring is all about for you. I said it. I got a house on the heel. And now I'm trying to teach as many people as I can how to get up there. And this mentoring campus and merit street is another part of it, which is going to let me be able to get to a whole lot more people. A lot faster, too, man. So I appreciate you picking up that phone and calling me and thanking a yo dog. And you know, me and you, man, we got a couple of other things. You know, people don't notice about you. The first person's house, I went over to head to electronic toilet. And you didn't tell me that it was electronic. And you told me you sent me in that bathroom. No one good in the heel well. You was going to be out there dying laughing because as I finished in the bathroom, I was standing there. And there was no button or handle to flush. What activates to flush is you step away and then it automatically flushes. Well, I'm standing there for 15 minutes. I'm under this toilet bowl looking for a button because I got a flush this man is totally because they know where in a way I like to walk out of here without flushing this man is totally. He won't be talking about me. And I knew you was out there laughing at me. I knew it. I knew you was. Was you know I was in there too long? Well, I figures, Hillbilly will walk away eventually. Yeah, but I couldn't. God. You know, I told you that it was a simple process. I wasn't going in there for the big one. It's just a little short. I'd be out here 30, 40 seconds, you know, unload, ski, ski, come on out. It's all I'm thinking. Boy, I was in there. I couldn't find that button. And I knew you was out there laughing at me because let me tell you what you did when I came out you was sitting on the couch. You just had your own for you smile. I said, hey, you're saying couldn't find the button. Good. No, you know what he said. He said you're going to do what you're going to do. He's going to dip it out of there and sell it on eBay. That's what you accused me of. Well, I thought that too. But I want to thank you because now every toilet in my house is that way. And I put him in the guest powder room too just so I know. And when my partner's come over from Cleveland. Yeah. I think I'm putting the camera in there. You bring some boys from the hood and there's just that one. One, two, so, right. I heard the one guy was in the bathroom. I heard what. Damn. No, he'll go, put him. You just in that cousin, man. I was outside the door and he said, man, you outside laughing.

No, she's very healthy oriented. And this is part of this health journey you've been on. Because you look good. You really look like you're very spelt. Thank you, feel. No, you really are. You're not at all. You look better than you have in a long time. I know. No, that ain't no lie. That's true. I'm actually reverse aging feel. Is that what it is? Yeah. I've actually taken some step back. I've lost 30 pounds. Yes. That's what I mean. You're skinny enough. I'm at 17.2% body fat, which for 67 year old dude is pretty old. Yeah. And it's I'm going to get better. But my goal is maybe 15% body fat. I want to say that. I want to say 14, but I'm scared. So let's just leave it at that. I'm just trying to live a long time. I just got this money. So I'm just trying to, you know, some of faux layers. You know, when you really hit. So I'm just trying to stick around. So this is in Walmart. Yes, in Walmart. Really? Yeah. And it's called Elevate You. Well, Robin was really excited about this. That's how I know you'll be taking it. So yeah. Yeah. That's exactly right. So is she's going to have this? She's going to have me all over this. Yeah. And I got a green drink and gummies. And it's got a stick packet. It's just going to change your whole everything. It's more to it now. You're going to have to do a little bit more. But that's to be getting. Wow. Yeah. So you have a video about this? Well, play it. Let's look at it. Oh, David. Yeah. We're here. Let's do it. You know, the problem I was having with this whole green drink phase that I was going through was the taste, right? I knew that the broccoli. I knew the kale. I knew the spinach was good for me. I just couldn't get it down. So when I came to you, what gave you the notion that you could put some chocolate with this? Call of the look at this right here. You put this on the plate. Show it to somebody they'll go, what the hell? And you went, yes, what the hell? And you put it together. How did come to you? What? Well, we knew that chocolate was something you really enjoyed. So we were motivated to figure it out. It certainly is a deflaver profile that normally goes with your greens. But what we decided to do was import chocolate flavors from Europe. And so we imported a ton and tried them out to see how we could get it to actually combine really well. And we found a way to actually combine it in just a lot of trial and error. And we got into work. That's actually John Lyon's. He's a Harvard scientist, Nutritionalist. He's a guy from Harvard. Way smarter than me. I didn't even know what he was talking about. So this is part of the whole program. Yeah. And this is, you've used this to help get out of your comfort zone. No. But I really get into what you're doing. It says Steve Harvey's elevates you. Yeah. Okay. So why you've been holding out on me on this? Well, you tell me about this before. You know how it is when you got a friend and you kind of in a competition you want to try to catch him a little bit. So I wanted to try to get in shape and be in, bring it to your attention. Yeah. Well, yeah. Thanks for caring so deeply about him. How great a shape I'm in. Well, you waited till you built merit before you called me. You know what? I wasn't there. I didn't see myself design in no studio with nothing. So yeah. But how you going to design my body, you're going to turn robin loose on me. I'm turning your wife on you. I know how to do it, man. Is this a gummy? Yeah. That's a gummy. So I can eat one of these. Yeah. You can eat one. Is it going to taste good? Oh, yeah. Lesson. And your brain will focus you. Like, you know how sometimes I can go off? Well, it focused me, Dr. Phil. Mm-hmm. How you can go off? You know on tangents. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I don't know. You can go off sometimes. But she's really smart. I got you a laugh. Like, I just chewed that one just now. And I'm like 30% smart. Really? Yeah. Yeah. How many of these do you eat at a time? I tried to eat about 13. I got a, I'm a load number. Well, I just had two. And I feel like I can just tear up a ruby few. No. No, this is, that really is, it does taste good. He does. All right. Thank you, brother.
