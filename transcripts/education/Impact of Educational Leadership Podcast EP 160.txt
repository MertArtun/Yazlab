 On welcome back to another impactful night. I think that's it. You should be set up so one of the C. The M.O.S.D.L.S. I did it three, four. I said, Dr.M. Thursday's plans are a Sandy Roberts and Buddy Dordpasso, and we're going to be doing the same thing to the bro, but it's going to please have loads of people. Good evening everybody. It is an absolute fun with the figure tonight with my family standing through it. Very good. Bring the 9 and I am just looking forward to tonight. And Sandy Roberts passed the M.O.S.D.L.S.D.L.S.D. The Lider. Absolutely. Yes, thank you. I'm so excited. I jumped in to say how the Lider that M.C.D.S.D.S.D.S.D. is going to be here tonight. Is it a hangout? It's a two of you. Well, when you're season like you are, it don't matter when you jump in, we just are a glad to have you in. What Debbie has said, the topic for the 9 is one that I just feel is going to be in far reaching. By the West, and that is setting up Masterclass courses, setting up Masterclass courses. Our education system is all-terrain. Whether we lack it or not, whether we believe it or not, it's happening right before our eyes. Parents, teachers, listen up. Our students, our scholars, our confused. They're confused about the random changes. They're arguing and posed on them since the onset of COVID-19. Teachers are leaving and droves, and they are disgusted. Mismanaged by forcing them to learn things. They do not want to know or need to know. And places they have no clue about, we need direction. We need questions to be answered. We need processes and patterns that we can find a guide to. And for this purpose, we have educational consultants like we have here tonight on the podcast. That's going to tell us why. It is so important that not only we create masterclasses, but we tailor make these classes for those different school cultures. We have to ask the question. And these questions help our country developers prepare and gather all the resources. They need for their masterclasses. So what they're being said tonight, we're going to talk a little bit about how to set up, when to set up a masterclass and what to expect from those masterclass courses. First, I want to go to Sandy Roberts. Sandy Roberts has been a while since we have had you on the podcast. Last time you were on, it was so amazing. We got some comments. What was your thought when we get you to talk for tonight? It could not possibly be better timing. This is so perfect in that. When you're here with, I'm up to right now, you are going to go, wow, her name was out there in the ether and no wonder I picked up on that master to come tonight. Okay, well, we're going to go right to it. What do you have to do? What do you have to do? What do you have to do? What do you have to do? Okay, here's what I'm up to. I had retired from teaching at the Community College in the psychology department. And before, well, I mean, I don't COVID, you know, took everything apart. And that. And so before that ended, I was also teaching, I was teaching dual enrollment courses, a psych one on one in cultural psych, to the college's charter high school. And that was just a small high school with, you know, just over a hundred students. And just marvelous. And with the best high school principal, I have ever met in my entire life. And so that kind of, you know, that, that ended with COVID. That was, you know, that kind of fall apart. I was doing other things after that. But then just like in the past, and not even two months, just just really, a little bit more than a month. And now I got a call from my high school principal guy. And he had he, he left where he had been with the college. And his, um, has taken a position with a high school from the Indian reservation. Remember, we're in Arizona. And asked if I would come and teach some dual enrollment classes for him. And he just, would you please come out of retirement and you just teach these classes. And he's just, he's the best principal seriously. And that, that I have ever worked with. And I couldn't say no. It was just like, I wanted to say no. But I couldn't. And so, the probably what I'm going to do is I'll be teaching a couple of classes for him. Second semester. So like, you know, after the holiday break and everything. And I'm, I'm looking forward to it. And I went out and spent a day after school. And they were doing some events. And it was, it just felt so comfortable. It was just really worth being there to help him to help the students to be involved in the community. And to be able to bring, you know, different aspects of, you know, the meanings of psychology, and culture, et cetera. And be able to work and communicate with the Native American community. So it's just like, I'm thrilled to be doing this. Total pain in the neck. I had to like, trip, trip down. You know, credentials and, you know, all these kinds of things. You know, where is this? And it's just, you know, I'm looking forward to only get started after the first two years. I'll teach second semester. And I'll teach two classes that the students will try to get to see your student first since they'll be graduating. And then see what we're going to do, you know, with the rest of the students. But it's really, it's invigorating to be someplace where they want you. And that is key to almost anything that we're doing. I mean, I have, I have dealt with schools where one of my favorite stories is I was fight based at a high school in California. And it was small high school. And then just down the coast from San Francisco. And pretty isolated from the other communities as far as traveling. And that to get to the main peninsula where to get up to San Francisco. Everything was over a mountain path. And it was, it was a really wonderful experience. But, you know, nobody wanted to be in campus. The, the county was, the county driving off the hall convention was paying for me to be on campus. You know, everything was, you know, you have to be here. Blood blood blood was a spiel was it. And then one morning I get a call at like 50 o'clock in the morning from the principal. And he says, okay, there's been a gang fight. There's problems. They're all fighting. How fast can you get here? And that was a major turning point. You know, I mean, I don't want somebody to have to have a crisis in order to, you know, listen. But, you know, up until that moment, you know, he could see no value in, you know, and someone being there was different kinds of skills. And that moment, which you don't, you know, necessarily want. And that it was a turning point. And that was, it was perceived completely different after that. So, you know, sometimes you just have to stick it out. That then the bottom line is helping to use. But the things that they need, the things that they deserve to have. That if someone isn't advocating for them, isn't it? Is it an adult advocating for them that they're going to miss out on? No, no, it was so, so good. What do you think? Oh, God, it was good. Let me, let me answer one question from you to explain to the audience. Because a lot of people may not know, they could know, but I know you can explain it. Can I explain to the listeners what is dual enrollment? What does that mean? Dual enrollment means that I am teaching a college course. The same exact course that I teach at the college for college credits to high school students. And they're earning college credits. So, depending upon when a school might start with the dual enrollment, so they're enrolled in high school and they're taking out the high school classes, but they're also enrolled in the college classes, which have to be taught by someone who, you know, can teach the college courses, of course. And so, I'm able to go in and teach the same psychology class that I'm teaching at the college, and they're getting college credits. So, if I teach two courses in the spring semester after the holiday break in school and January, and that there will be students who will have six college units as they go when they graduate from high school. You can see that's incredible. Yes, basically. No, that is incredible. And it's so necessary and it's so crucial and when I say it's so necessary and why I say it's so crucial. Because there is a lot of social economically disadvantaged adolescents there in school, especially those public schools. And so, you know, we got poverty there. You know, we got people that, you know, are living in a single parent house holds, right? And where, in most cases, the mom has to bring home the bacon. Then she has to cook the bacon. And then she has to put the kids to bed after them eating the bacon and getting the ready and doing homework. So, this is so tiring, right? In most cases, so that poverty is there and that also you have bullying, right? That's also there in that mix that's being dealt with. So, now we're in this demographic, we're in this area and we're dealing with many challenges, right? And then, let's throw in COVID-19 and monkey parks, right? So, there's so much going on. Let me go to the body of Thornton, pot such changes in Pro. We're kind of the pot such changes in Pro because he has so gifted in this area he's able to take complex challenges and just chew on them and when he regurgates. He's able to section them off in a way that people can understand and they can see the way he illustrates and paints the picture. But he thought, what was your thoughts when you got the topic for tonight? I believe that because of COVID, I mean, obviously we had virtual learning and we had digital learning, we had in person learning for decades before COVID. But COVID actually created a situation where we were forced to stop incrementally innovating and just tweaking the learning process. And we had to look at disruptive innovation, we had to look at creating an entirely new model. And the hybrid model that has been used by a lot of the school systems is the height of what I like to call incremental innovation. They took what they could out of each systems and they put them together and some very, very high level people and some people who were just willing to think outside the box. Step up and said, this isn't good enough. We need to disrupt it. We need to tear it apart and we need to make it all together again. And so you've got people who actually looked at how we teach people and how people learn and they started creating a system that would allow us to escape age barriers escape. Demographics escape, affluence versus non-affluence and start treating people and educating people based on where they are right now. And that's what I see in the master classes that I've observed and that instructors I've talked to across the country, they're all saying the same thing. They are tweaking different portions of their master classes so that they can start from the very, very low end, all the way to the very high end and they are literally reinventing education based on where the learner is not where the education system thinks they need to be. And that's where I got out of when I used to start. Absolutely, we thank you for that. When you were talking, I could not help but think about affluence, how people are affluent and they come into a situation and they give a motivation to different situations that change the course of how people see things and how people interact. And you have those people that have influence that are able to just naturally come into a situation not even knowing sometimes that they even have influence. And people are just inclined to follow every step that they make and it's that guidance right. And it helps us become effective right and just become effective. I would say across the board right and so we're living in this society now that what do you want to believe in? You know, coming out of COVID-19, that was a very helpless and a very hopeless. I believe this is just my thoughts. And I think that's a time in our life in the world where people could not find, you know, what was next. You know, you had some people out there that those gifted people right, they have influence and influence that were thinking forward. Like like yourself and like Sandy who who we're thinking, you know, when this is just a time period, this is just an era and time. We're going to come out of this and so we need to have things set in place so that when we cross this bridge when we transition from this place. We need to have something that's appropriate, something that's effective and something that's necessary for the people to help build them back up right. And so when we talk about building people back up, that is not a lightweight. There's not a lightweight duty, there's not lightweight tasks. And I believe you have to have some passion, you have to have some love, you got to have. Well, let me ask, what do you have to have? What did you have to have? What feel your passion, right, especially coming out of COVID-19? Because you know, both do you have done so much from, you know, from before COVID-19 to now, what has felt what is the most single thing? What is the single thing? There has filled your passion to create. That would be my first question across the board. This is the panels open. Who wants to take their first? I'll jump in. Okay, when you were saying that what came to my mind is these things that has worked the best for me and for the schools for the past, all the way back to. I would say like 20 some years at least. And that is that there needs to be and for me as far as I'm concerned that. And that there has to be this in every school and that if they're going to really make some progress, we need peer programs. We need the students teaching each other. They need to actually, I don't usually like really, really, sorry, seriously promote my website. But if you go to my website, SandyRowrits.com, there's a whole thing on peer counseling programs and that and that student student and the students turn teens, middle school, etc. Even grade school. They turn to each other long before that's all apparent, what's wrong? And they're within the scope of the peer counseling programs are adults who can help bridge that and who can help them be able to talk to their parents. Otherwise, otherwise you have tragedy and that like serious tragedy like suicidal tragedy. The other piece is basically within the framework of how I'm at buddy and that is calcic resolution. And that when these kids know how to help themselves in each other through what I would call, you know, basic mental health, emotional health, etc. with the peer counseling, then they need to know how to resolve conflicts. And when they need, when they are able to help each other get past the difficult time and know how to just sit down and to start to be able to in a positive way, the personalized something so that they can, you know, deconstruct it and build it up stronger. And those two avenues are, you know, I mean, what do you think, buddy? Well, I couldn't agree more. The two things that kids need to know that they can build competency is the two things that drive them on the genetic level. I mean, there's no such thing as a teenager who doesn't want socialization. And there's only one thing that they fear in socialization is that is that it's going to become an outcast or be ostracized. So if they don't learn a how to become relational and b, you learn how to handle conflict as it emerges so that they don't become ostracized. And then they, you know, they just aren't meeting their needs and every teenager, every child for say age 10, 11 all the way into the early 20s faces that dynamic. It's it's not something that we should be debating about. It's something that there should be consensus about and we should plan everything around that dynamic. Yes, and it would end up happening is they say, oh no, we need to do this other branch of, you know, English 978 and a half and the heck with the social competency skills. And I know I saw Harsh on that, but sometimes if they don't take the time to help the person build the person and address the internal things that they have going on and whatever's happening is home. But ever is happening in the community where there's happening on the school bus or the playground and that they need these coping skills and when they have those coping skills, it frees up time to be able to concentrate on the learning skills that we want them to have. I want to add one thing to that too, when you start looking at the difference between affluent and not affluent populations. The affluent populations are not necessarily benefited by because they're entitled and they have access to a larger amount of resources. That actually handicaps them in some circumstances and I'll give you the reason I say that there's a continuum for all kinds of behavior. And when we have the gift of technology and we have the gift to be able to grab our smartphone and just look up anything. How important is it to learn some of the raw basic skills that are being taught in school core knowledge. But now go to the other extreme because if it's good on running and it has to also be good on the other if. If you were to all of a sudden go into the forest with the Mosco Pirotry and the Amazon's. I have absolutely no clue what a smartphone is who looks for turtle eggs and that's what they is their main diet and they they look at modern man as if we're a bunch of lazy and consider it can't do anything people. If you sent our normal teenager into that environment they would be like a baby without a diaper. They wouldn't be able to function whatsoever. But if they had relationships skills and they understood how to observe and learn and adapt and avoid conflict they could survive. There's no other skill that we can teach these kids that if we were all a sudden bombed about back to the Stone Age out because of some crazy war that happens. The ones who can't adapt and have those skills will not survive. The only survivors will be the ones who embrace, outrace to press a crossing and understand the power of being relationship. You know what you said was so profound and you know you talked about cultures and for those who listen cultures for me simply is a way of life. A way of life for people how people live that's their way of life. And so being observing, being observing meaning I'm watching how this person lives and I respect the way they live. Now I can, you know I cannot embarrass myself one but I can also add to that or I can take away is up to, you know, my perception how to I perceive that thing right before I ask the question let me say this when we do our because we have an anti bullying. We're doing the anti bullying campaign but we also have an anti bullying course and one of the survey questions that we ask is the dis training teach you to take action by helping the victim. Right because we want to know if they understand you know what it means to help someone that needs help right this is very important another question we ask in the survey is. The survey or the dis training teach you to take action by shifting the focus and redirecting the bully away from the victim right and so these are some questions that we ask. Our participants or our students that go through these trainings because this is how we design our course you know I was bullied as a child. And so that's why I developed this anti bullying course that this anti bullying campaign right because I learned a lot of I got a lot of tools on how to manage bullying right so let me answer the question and open up the panel. How did you start your first master class course who wants to take the first. When I was trying to decide how to take the information that I believe that would be beneficial when I pivoted from my larger career to my second life. Americans are not supposed to have a second or a third act and I think seeing it and I are both probably on our third or four has so that that gets blown out of the water. But what I wanted to look at was what would be the outcome and is the outcome relevant to the receiver. And is the topic something that the instructor can have passion about. Because what's missing in education is the passionate teacher the role model the passionate role model because. If you don't have passion about a topic you're only going to teach wrote information and you may not even be able to test some of the nuances of the topic. But if you have passion about the topic. Then you can create an overwhelming Picasso course that master course that will hit a lot of the high points and the low points. And when people ask you questions in the Q and A you can expand those high points and low points until you get to a point of almost infinity with the master course when you design a master course you make it so that it benefits anyone at any level who can take it. And you build a library of answers that you may not have had at some of your students or someone may have had you have to build it so that it is on the directional you are not just disseminating information. And you have to be willing to adapt to incoming and new information and the more knowledgeable other. There's someone takes a class and they go I think you have that wrong and they're right you have to number one admitted to included in the next version of the course and keep adapting. Education is not static which is one of the biggest problems in the American education system but that's how I do my master classes. But started me was realizing that that was the pivot point. Well so well said that it just so well stated. I think that we have to loop around sometimes where the teacher sometimes where the students and it's always you know it's not we don't stop being the students just because we have things that we can be the teacher in. I always have to be open to you know where is this going how all have things changed. It's always a matter of you know it just goes on and it's it's slow and then we all those of us who have been trained and who know people who've been trained and that's the handle. There are tough situations you know they're able to help us be able to reach enough people. There were so many times and I'm sure you've had the same thing. There were so many times that you know I would be trying to help a school or help a program or something like that and it would come down to that someone would have to tell them that they had to do that. They had to extract the class except the training except you know what I was able to teach them. You know or they would lose something you know maybe you some of their funding or something like that from you know the counties that you know are funding schools. And the state and it was so weird to have someone you know from the state department of education or from the county say you need to have her come and talk to your students otherwise. We're you know we're just not going to fund some of these things that you want to do and you know I'm absolutely calls it tally wishing that that wasn't the case that you know that there were more of the ones that would say you know. Of course you know think having to come and talk to them about some of these other situations when I was going to a classroom and talk to the students about specific prevention. I would have at a certain point I would have the teacher go to the back of the room and then I would ask some questions that the students were able to answer that were you know more. You know topic driven questions and the teacher was supposed to be back there you know noticing who had their hand up you know who has their hand up. You know to answer is you know has there ever been a suicide in your family do you know are you aware of you know this are you aware of how to handle a conflict would you like to learn how to handle a conflict. And you know and actually take a poll and be willing to do something with that but in each case it was really. I happen to be fortunate to be in a progressive county in Northern California and I was fortunate that the county really stood up for these things the county wanted to see the schools put in some peer programs peer to peer. And they were the ones who would say you know okay we're going to have the statewide conference and you know who would like to be a presenter and so a couple years I took students who presented as the conferences. So being able to have the financial and educational backing makes you know all the difference in the world and the the school test to take responsibility for more than knowing how to add to and to. And so this is so good this is so so good let me let me go further I want to go further I want to go further because what in the conversation is now is I think it has changed I think it's pivoted and whether I mean by that it has pivoted so you know we have. I mean we have so many things that need to be clarified right we need to clarify first of all we need to clarify how do people learn. People don't learn the same some people learn by singing some people learn by watching some people learn by hands on right and so it takes those master communicators like yourselves. And so to observe a situation and to determine okay this is going to fit for this these people and this group will benefit better they're going to understand why you know where we have to learn it this way right because I have a strategy for this learning style. I've developed a course that's going to give them the ability to understand different viewpoints. I'm going to have them improve the way they see things. If you have a course that helps people to network I'm going to improve their network skills. If you have a course that helps people talk about tough conversations I'm going to help them apply right not like to giving them a more cohesive decision making skill. Right and then let's talk about tough conversations. I feel like and I could be wrong because buddy I'm I'm I'm I mean you're laying now because you you wrote a book and you wrote a course called tough conversations tough choices and this is your TC squared but. Does TC squared work with every learning style. Does it affect people the same way across the board we know people receive information differently we know people. Give information differently right so. Why do we need to understand learning styles right and why do we learn understand these learn styles. So that we know the possibilities of how people are receiving what we say. No, they're viewpoints. Oh, what we say they're perspective. Oh, what we say doesn't even matter should we even share. What they think when we're teaching them. Or do we just want to teach to the test I mean. What's your thoughts. Why do we need to why do we need to understand learning styles. You know, when you said you were getting my lane yet you know you really you jumped right in there and you planted yourself right on that center line so. Let's let's look at one thing very important when you talk about conflict as an example. And you're talking about why you need to understand learning styles because conflict only has three sources. Especially if it's conflict in a group inspired. There's task oriented conflict based on perceptions of who's doing what who's not doing what. There's relationship oriented well, who's who's buddy enough with who who's ganged up on who and then there's value oriented conflict. And that comes from people who value the outcome or people who valued participating in the process and there's you know there's a it's infinite number of ways you can paint those three different artifacts but task oriented relationship oriented and value oriented are the basic origins of all conflict. But now let's touch that to learning styles. Everyone always says there's a visual auditory and kinesthetic learning styles but that doesn't paint the whole picture. The visual auditory or what we like to call observational learning styles. Kinesthetic is doing but there's two different types of doing. There's physical doing where you're actually manipulating your biology to get something done and then there's reading writing interactive communication. And you know taking a conversation up the ladder with someone else so that you can co learn at the same time that's another form of kinesthetic learning. So there's really four main ways to learn and then there's those hybrid things that interact with all four of those main and that's logical learning. That's social learning social learning. It cannot be done in any other way you can't do it by yourself. And then the flip side of that coin you have self driven solitary learning. And then what we have is naturalistic learning and that's part of child development that's part of how you get all your biases and how you get all of your opinions. But those are the four main and the four hybrid types of learning. But then we also have some style things and you brought one end you said music. You know music is a wonderful medium for some people to learn. They can also learn not only information about what music does, what it brings the art, the aesthetic value, but they also learn that music suits the savage beast. It is a calming effect. It's a coping mechanism. There's an interpersonal learning. There's interpersonal learning. There's perspective making and perspective taking. Okay. All these are things that happen during human development. And when you get to the end of the road and you're looking at a functional adult. You have to look at the way adults learn as well. Adults have four basic learning styles. And then you're going to incorporate all of those other styles. Because by the time you become a functional adult, you may have a preferred style, but you're going to incorporate all of the styles. But you then you separate it into matrix. Some people have to do things by a mini driven system. It's called step learning. Then there's the talk about or reverse about or come to some type of consensus about. And then there's research where you can do it alone or in teams. Another way to drive yourself back to that talk about scenario. And then there's those guys who are what I like to call the super learners. Those are the guys who take that research in a loan or teams and they pivot the other direction. And they create, they innovate. They disrupt society. And so as you can see, those main and those hybrid eight bunch that is in the development stage actually put you where you are as an adult. And I think that it's a critical mission to join those two with a bridge. You have to understand how those main developmental learning styles become those adult styles. And the way you do that is you create an environment where you tell people that if you're not the expert in the room and how we define expert in the room is the person in the room with the most knowledge about the topic on the table. But you should be perspective taking. You should be actively listening. You should be participating in asking questions so that you can get the information referring to such a way that you understand it. Because the goal is to be able to do perspective making to someone else later further down the line. And what I like to label that is a co-creation feedback cycle where you pivot back and forth between perspective taking and perspective making over and over and over again. And the biology is simple. The human brain has over 100 billion nerve cells. There is no way any person can say, oh, I'm only a visual learner. That's not true. You learn through every different process and the older you get, the more you incorporate all those styles. But there has to be a roadmap. So if you can't identify where someone is in the development stage and get them adapt and adopt all those other styles when they become an adult, they're going to be missing some components. And all you have to look at today's society to see where that gets us. And that's why it's really important to understand learning. That was high off the press. Ladies and gentlemen, that was very dirty process. It's a throw. Listen, but what you said, I'm going to change it up on you. Check it up. What you said, if I put a beat to what you said, it would be a rap song. And I know rap has those six patients and those rhythms. It's the improv. But it's hip hop. Right. It's hip hop. It's freestyle. It's rapping. It's jazz. It's improv. It's improvisation. I do speaking. Man, I forget all about it. And I feel so horrible. I had a conversation with the legend George Duke. Jazz, extraordinary. He was not just an musician, a composer, a tenor performer, a film director. He was just the gamut. He was a gamut. He was like a Michael Jackson of jazz. He was like a prince of jazz. He was George Duke. I mean, this guy. And I had a conversation with him. And it was about practice. Right. And he told me he said, I said, before you go out and play and do a set or whatever. You want to call it. He said, do you practice the performance in your mind? And I said, what? He said, do you practice from A to Z to performance in your mind? And listen, I blew my mind. Because if we were doing other movies, this jazz composition. And he said to me, do you play that song in your mind? And improv, do all the improvisation in your mind? Before you go out and play it physically. And I'm beyond, which I told him, no, I didn't. He said, well, they're not really learning that song. Because you're not utilizing all the parts of your brain. And here's a guy that played with Miles Davis. To create a big hand card. I mean, you name it. To our cold train. The list goes on and on. And so what he's telling me is what was told to him from the masters. We got an unamasturated night. Surrey Roberts, Sandy Roberts. Sandy Roberts. He got me over here. I was just listening. I am moving here tonight. What's going on? I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want our basket this moment where I'm being on the same pedestal with It's incredible, it's incredible, it's incredible. It's incredible. It's incredible. It's incredible, it's incredible. It's real, it's real. No, I mean, when Buddy was speaking, that's, you know, that's where he's at, right? And it's like, you know, you got to find your leg. And that's his leg, that's where he's at, right? That's his road, that's his destiny. Yeah. And I see the signs. I see the signs, I see signs. And so, you know, Sandy, I start talking to my jazz. I start to, I love jazz. I mean, I, I, I used to breathe jazz. I mean, I would work a job and get a paycheck in two weeks. And most of my paycheck went to jazz cities. It was addiction. It was, I had to get counseling. It was just too much. It was too much. But let me go here. So with jazz. And improv, this communication is interplay, right? Because we're sitting, I'm sitting at an honest set. And maybe I'm on the piano, right? And the drummer, he's there, or she's there, right? And the bass players there. And the, you know, maybe it's the saxophonist there, or a good guitar player. And we're communicating. We're all on one's heat. She's a music. Right? So when the music says, hey, get loud. We gotta get loud. When the music says, go medium. We have to go medium. When the music says, go soft. We have to go soft. When the music says, you have to sickle paint this beat, you know, or this rhythm. Exactly at this point. And it creates a motif. Or the thing. We have to be there. We have to communicate. And the thing about music is when it's off. Everyone knows it. You can't hide. You can't hide. Whereas when you're talking, I believe the masters they can hear when you get off. My question to you. Miss Andy. What's the question? We're at least a miscommunication between people who do not have similar. And I'm not just talking culture here, but who does not have similar values and beliefs. What leads to that miscommunication? Will these give them getting off the beat? Will these give off the same she, the music, especially in the workplace? And them drifting off until no man's land? What is going on here? Please give us some wisdom and that matter. So there's so much of it that expectations of doing well are often. The expectation is okay, but they're picking the wrong thing to tackle to do well. And if they were wanting to do well, like a doctor or something like that, they know that they're going to need to commit to study, etc., the musician. The musician is not going to just like open some case and automatically know how to work the instrument. You can give me an incredible instrument. And I open the case and I go, okay, what do I do? Do I touch it? Do I blow on it? Do I inhale on? What do I do to make it make music? I miss a lot of steps along the way where we have expectations that somebody is supposed to know all these things. And we forget to inquire. And that. So I mean, as someone said, this is amazing. I've had this experience with it. Would you like to try it? And I might have to say, well, do I blow on it? Do I hold it? Do I do something with my fingers? What do I do with it? And so we need to pass along these talents. We need to pass along, you know, how to do things. And sometimes we get so caught up and trying to, just, you know, manage, trying to put food on the table, trying to, you know, keep our relationships together that we get lost in them. We get lost as a stuff. And then little things become, you know, the petty things become huge. And we get sidetracked. And, you know, it's a hard place to be in, but it's understandable. And so we're not bad for getting into those little side trips. But what we do need to do is we need to look for when there's someone that can help us move through it faster than if we have to figure the whole thing out on their own. And then I am so not musically talented. I have a sister who is fabulous in musically talented. And then she could play things on the piano that you thought that she had studied for 20 years when she was nine. And that, you know, me, it's like, you know, I can't even play chopsticks. So we have a group of different kinds of kind of, I don't even know the name of the dance, you know, and that's, you know, everybody needed to be at the same place. Or as the same skill, you know, we can be a pretty boring country and everybody be doing just the same thing. And we need to look at that in our business, in our relationships, and in our schools, you know, right now they're so busy teaching to the test and that they're not teaching the person. And we have so many places where we really need to go back and say, what are we helping the person with? What is going to help them survive and be able to utilize these skills? We're so worried that, I mean, we've come into a whole, you know, everything's taken away from us, not given to us. And we need to get back into sharing. We need to, you know, get back into, you know, how can this help more people? How can, you know, how can this help me? Is that, you know, just because I might be knowledgeable in one situation doesn't mean I'm equally knowledgeable in another situation. So, you know, I, where forever the teacher and the student, and, you know, I think those are the things that we have to remember. We start to put pressure on someone to, you know, always be the teacher, or always be the student, and we kind of give off track. I'm sending you a message. I'm sending you a message. But, but before you answer something to that, let me say this real quick. Second Roberts, you are loved. When I say, you are loved, I mean, you are loved. You are loved. You talk, when you talk about the way you dealt with communication, you dealt with, like, dimensions. When you dealt with it, like, dimensions, dimensions, dimensions are spaces, dimensions are, environments, dimensions are layers, dimensions are, our episodes is an infrastructure. At the panel is open, I don't know, but the panel is open, and I just cannot wait to hear what Buddy has to say, but when you talked about communication, I heard the dimensions are like, you open up doors and different dimensions and different layers. Buddy called it too, but I cannot wait to hear what Buddy has to say. Go ahead, please, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Well, I think it's really important that we pivot to someone who's not here, and I give him credit. But when Dr. Larry Davis has asked about standardized tests, his immediate response is, we do not have standardized children, we do not come from standardized families, we don't live in standardized environments. How can standard aid is, case and help these kids? And I fully agree with that. But, you know, when you're looking at what leads to miscommunication, and I think Sandy hit it dead on when she said expectations and comfort zone is applicable. People are not taught relativity. Just because you think something is a certain way, doesn't mean the person standing next to you thinks the same way. Everyone has the right to have an opinion. The only thing that has to be maintained is solid facts. But the majority of what we have in the world is opinion. You know, certified or certainty about something is very difficult to prove. So, what beer left with is the best or most applicable opinion, but you have to be willing to be curious about the other person. And you have to be willing to accept that just because you have a value or belief about something, it's not the best, it's not optimal. It's just one of a million different ways to look at that value or belief. And you have to give anybody else their due to have a different opinion, a different value, a different belief. Now, does that create this harmony in terms? Absolutely, but this harmony is how we evolve. That's the one thing Sandy said that I grew right in meeting you, right up out of the mud. She said that if we were all the same, how boring would we be? We would be aesthetically boring. I'm going to tell you, the teacher that I was the most ingrained with was an education teacher who taught English. And you know, back when I went to school, when Sandy went to school, we were taught the classics. You read, McBeth, you read Hamlet, you read the classics. Okay, but this teacher said, no, I got motorheads in the class. If they want to bring popular mechanics to school, and they want to do a report on the article from popular mechanics, I'm going to give them an A because it proves they know how to read, comprehend, and reframe, and re-gurgitate the information. And that taught me a valuable lesson, very early in life that everyone is different. Everyone is unique, everyone should have the ability to impress their teacher that they have a certain skill, and it doesn't get taught in a standardized way. That's so important. That's so well said. I'm applauding you, K.A. And so true, I mean, so half of my frustration in the classroom is because somebody else is telling me what I'm supposed to say, and I'm not willing to do it. And this has, yes, I am a rebel. But I just want them to have an open opportunity to see multiple sides of something. And that, and someone else that come along and say, you need to do it. And I don't know. I want to say that it's first of all that I'm really, really appreciative that you brought Sandy into this conversation. You know, it takes decades, decades, to be comfortable speaking about some of the topics that Sandy is a world-class expert on, like the pain and anguish of having to lose a loved one out of no other reason than someone didn't see something. Someone didn't catch something. Someone didn't prevent something. When she talks about suicide and she talks about suicide prevention, she always approaches it from a practical position with empathy. Is there a reason why we can't apply that to other topics and other education spheres? You know, even in the hard sciences, when someone's having difficulty learning something, shouldn't we take the time to realize that maybe that's not their place where they need to be and we pivot them somewhere else and then give them credit for what they are good for it? I mean, that's what we need to do. We can't just, you know, people and say they can't do something because obviously everyone has a skill set. And I think I could never do what Sandy does at the level she does. She is so fantastic about what she does. And likewise, you know, you can say that about anybody who's an expert, educated. We are not teachers, we're not educators. We are learning environment facilitators. We take what's given to us and we try to way to spread it out of the table and get the kids and the adults to find the information in whatever way they optimize and then we reframe it into their optimization so that they get it when they walk out the door. They also have at least the equal education based on their learning. And that's what people like Sandy bring to the table. Now, let's think, what does it think that was striking me well. You were seeing that as I remember I was in a biology class. Definitely not one of those conversations and that is in the sciences. But there was a, there was a gallon of class who was having trouble taking notes on suicide. And if the, if the teacher was not looking at the class, but was stating on the board and talking at the same time, she would have no way of knowing what he was saying. And we got into a conversation and she asked would I consider, like just putting a carbon under my note taking and you know, just give her the copy of my raw notes. And I said, yeah, that would be really, really, really great. And then I saw her playing tennis. And it was like, oh my gosh, it was so good. I was like, she was like, a plus plus plus player. And I was like, see, you know, plus minus minus minus player. And I said, yeah, let's make a deal. I said, I will take notes and you know, make sure that there is, as legible as possible and try to capture, you know, let the professor saying. And when you teach me some more about tennis. And that's exactly what we did. We had a nice little system of math. And she beat up on the tennis court together. And that and she made me a little bit of a better player at least. And you know, and I showed my notes. And it was such a steel good. It was, you know, I mean, she didn't have the opportunity unless someone helped her with hearing what was going on in class. And I didn't have someone, you know, helping me, you know, be a little bit better on the tennis court. You know, sometimes they just kind of fall into our lap and we need to appreciate them.
