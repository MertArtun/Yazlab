Miss Grace Abkins who taught and was the Larding Lab Director in Kanoa, Georgia and month-worth grade teacher and Mrs. Sharon Howard, a kindergarten teacher in Albany, Georgia. Let's talk about a lifetime legacy of great teaching and you'll learn a lot also about living an incredible life. Cool cat teacher talk episode eight. Talking about teaching legacy. Ever wondered how a remarkable teaching happens? Find out right now at Cool Cat Teacher Talk with award-winning teacher Vicky Davis. Get insights from top educators, tech tips and inspiration to elevate your teaching. Today's first guest is Mrs. Grace Abkins. She was my fourth grade teacher and in just past way age 96. According to her habitually, she taught for 77 years and when she retired at age 94, her retirement went viral. That week after going to her retirement party, I got on a plane and went to Microsoft and I was doing some work and when I walked into that meeting the next morning, some people in the meeting had read about Miss Abkins. But I got to see her up close and personal. Miss Abkins changed my life and is one of my dearest mentors and she will be deeply missed. Last year when I went to start teacher at my school in the district, literally the last phone call I got on my home phone before I disconnected it was from Mrs. Akins. This was after she had already retired and this is what she said to me. I'll try to say it without tearing up. Vicky saw in the newspaper that your star teacher for the district, I always knew you were a star and I'm so proud of you. I always knew you were a winner. Oh Miss Akins, that meant the world to me. And here she was age 95 and she was still being my teacher. I remember going over to her house and she had books everywhere and in fact when I was in Thomas Friedman's book, The World is flat. She actually brought me the book and it was version 3 and she had read it. She was like, hey, do you know your own page 200 and something of this book? And that's the kind of person she was. She was a reader. She got certified at growing leaders just a few years ago. So she was always learning, always going to PD and when I say this woman is truly one of the greatest people I've ever known, I'm mean it. Now this episode was recorded before Miss Akins retired when she was a young and spy 89 and when I was still teaching at Westwood Schools and she was my colleague. I hope you are as inspired as I am because all of us can learn about what she taught us, about being a better teacher and a better human being. Whoever you are, her investment advice is one worth listening to. Enjoy this episode with Miss Grace Atkins. This is episode 191 of the 10 minute teacher podcast. So Miss Grace Atkins was my fourth grade teacher and an inspiration to me. She's been teaching for 56 years. She is our learning lab director here at Westwood Schools and I can tell you in my life she's probably the most amazing person that I know. She inspires me every day. I want to be like her when I grow up and she is just an incredible person. So Miss Atkins, you've taught for 56 years. So you taught for quite some time and you're not even slowing down yet. You don't look like it all and you're getting close to that 90th birthday there. What keeps you in education? It's always another child to help and you don't give up on children. Now you have some amazing kids that people have given up on. Tell us some of the things that your students who struggle with learning differences are now doing. Well I have wondered is some vascula surgeon. She wrote everything back which had ADHD and we had an educational prescription that we failed and his parents failed at home and he didn't give up, his family didn't give up and we didn't. So there he is. Of course I have many others to jump on. You wonder if they're going to make it but you keep on working with them every day and they make it. Yeah, I mean my two of my children have learning differences and you just always helped me coach what's your secret for not giving up? Well that gives me a reason to get up every morning. I get up at the real clock. Right my exercise by 10 miles. Right 18 miles to school. So I'm inspired you. Me whatever come. She's okay. So let's talk about that routine because actually you have some family members that have ended up on the radio in Atlanta because nobody can believe you're routine. Tell us your routine of what you do in a typical day. Well I just showed you part of what I do but I get up and I'm riding a bike 10 miles in the morning and then I have my morning devotion and I am to God post. Evosho below. That Mr. Wood just funded. I didn't know he did that. I don't have to stand and then I have one other Bobo study that I do every morning and then I write down quotes that I want to go through. They say we're never long we always have somebody with us. It'll open by now. Now you read more than anybody I know. Oh and I read. So when do you read? I have 40 books a year. What I read? I'm not reading. I'm not a book. Oh, I'm a pebble. Oh, we love Pat Williams. Missackins and I talk books all the time. Now we want the listeners to know a little bit about who this amazing Mr. Woodruff is that Missackins is talking about. Would you tell us what your husband did and a little bit about Mr. Woodruff because he's really instrumental in us even having a learning lab here at Westwood? Well, now Harusman and I move to the plantation and well we were 27 years old and we're talking about it to a plantation in Baker County. Mr. Harder, it would be a hit was for the greatest man I ever knew and he will make a help. Everybody and make a difference. He started his plantation in 1928 the year we were born in Harusman and then we my husband was there from age 27 to read how he was still a consultant for the plantation but Mr. Woodruff we need about the plantation started. So someone have a what they call a river and he asked what was wrong with that man and they said well he has some the malaria area so Mr. Woodruff went back to Atlanta and then he set up a scientist at the plantation in an research place to stamp out the malaria. Which that went on to become the CDC and of course Mr. Woodruff is he's climbed to find my guess was as head of Coca-Cola and I have to say that my husband kept also works at the Jones ecological center which is on H.O.I. Plantation nail so we do have quite a love of that. It's just no way in what he's done. Yes and there's many many books on Mr. Woodruff and I think the thing that's amazing about Miss Ackens is that so many of his habits is habit of reading his love of people, his desire to make a difference are all part of who you are too and you've kind of spread that to us to me. Let's go back to learning differences on some people call them disabilities but I just feel like you know everybody learns differently so you are one of the pioneers in reaching kids with learning disabilities tell us how what you did. The first year I told was 1946 and it was my nation from then on to find out why bright children did not always do well in school. I knew they were bright and so through 1946 that was my mission to find out and it took me 30 years because I was in the reading department and your answer is an odd in reading. I met a new row of psychologists have the 30 years and so the way to reach these children is through new biology and psychology applied to education and that's what we've done since 1976 and that was not to wag the right and then I met another new row of psychologists because I've been all over the country to international conferences this often year of psychologists I heard speak in the late 1981 again in 1983 in Washington DC and again in New York in 1986 and then I flew her down so what was her name? Rope, Dr. Rope. Hey again in the center in New York medical center was nine so I heard and I flew her down from New York to it and I had a lot of problems here here to train the teachers at Westwood now what I found in 81 was an evaluation she and Dr. Rope herself had developed at the center Rosa Hayden Center and it was to identify pre-academic skills and yes she's here for academic success so from there I came back in the friend of mine Dennis wife, Mr. Louise Stevenson I said I found what I've been looking for an evaluation to identify those children that don't have the necessary skills to be in academics and we started using it and she's staying. Rose Hayden a college college classroom made a mind vote in the most likely to succeed and there that was some and that's the search and teach program was that right which is really the reason that all of our kids are reading you know pretty much most of our kids are reading at the end of K4 but a lot you know you know I think it's pretty much all at the end of K4 isn't it I found another evaluation and I got the school psychologist I bought it and she evaluated I was three year old leaving some of them before then not leaving that program and we have an evaluation on the when they leave this or the if program now it was the name of that program well it tells whether they are so the social skills and all different types skills at an as year for success well they're in place or developing and people all over the world I guess you can can understand comment spend days with Ms. Advice she always has guests coming in and watching what we're doing in the lab and so much of it is one on one personal attention isn't it Missackins it is on the work is down on on one and then I am well at first we do this search screening and give them two weeks to get in their routine while we grade some work and then we start feeling those search the script and their psychological and that's one one now all these years that I've struggled having two of my three kids with learning differences you've always encouraged me what do you tell the parents who are listening who they know their child is bright they look in their eyes they know their bright but right now they're just not performing what do you say to those parents I tell them don't give up that we say possibility she needs child and we don't stop we're fighting down how they learn and we develop a program to give them yeah and but that can be done anywhere right because not everybody can come and be in your lab can that be done because you know there's some parents who know their child is bright and they can't find anybody to help them well I'm half that all the time from the love of South West Georgia and from the Florida pin handle and Orlando all the way around and have brought their children for me to evaluate but you know here's the thing doesn't it make you angry when kids are able to get the help they need well I dream of to let that happen if I meet them and I saw a lady in the doctor's office yesterday and I saw the two little boys with a smiling and she was and when I said then we were going to ask about because they were looking so pleased and he said I know you you talked about it and I couldn't bring in from the worst county but I'm homeschool and I'm doing what you told me to do and I told the little boy he's six right now and I said I talked about the conversation with him six great and actually he was seeing and shows the parent is feeling he should have some his actions have you ever made a mistake what do you think your biggest mistake you might have ever made somewhere in that teaching career? well I don't know every problem I saw I tried to shop and I didn't stop and told my family so I shouldn't you can't give up when you should shop you know one of my students on the board told me the other day I know they are just in quotes it comes you count me in there are right six right? she always brought artists to see an insect amount for the library and so we all know our artwork because of the seconds because it's not just about reading and writing and arithmetic it's about living life got jj so so as we finish up I know recently you got certified for growing leaders so you're still educating yourself and one time you told me something about how you organize your money I don't know if you remember the percentages well when I found I had a young lady that knows how since she doesn't do anybody's by my name but she's going to remind her she's gone into photography and made a lot of money going into photography so she quit doing houses and the first time she this show took up she was a photographer and her she came to my house on Saturday and she walked in and said she was going to give her money to give her first 10% to the law and she's going to give all that money I said you got to get on this 70 10 10 10 you don't be live on 70 percent you put 10 out of cash books savings and you put 10 like if you may you can bro she said oh I don't need a new camera the other 10 percent is your top isn't it I'm going to take a ride yeah yeah 10 percent guys 10 percent of cash books saving 10 percent to buy new equipment if you're long oh oh oh yeah you said I would do it yeah I'm too invest in yourself and invest in the things that you need and it just it just makes so much since so you're big into motivational books and motivational quotes you're kind of one of the first people that really besides my mom who got me into reading who your favorite authors well Pat Williams got to him he got love here in cloud candy and bruise and then those in the last 10 or 20 years but I've had some over the years I've known in his and pill so the seconds as we finish up this interview you have lived an amazing life you still live an amazing life you have more energy than almost anybody I know and you know you're riding all these miles on your bike and what do you think the secret is to live in a great life well first you put the Lord first into his will but then you have to do your part the eating right exercising and rage keep your mind over so I'll read good books definitely a 40 year and share them so do you think that teaching and working with kids with learning differences for 56 years has been worth it oh yes and that's what keeps me going is my family and my baby connection with my children is good. well Missackins is one of is a is remarkable and I talk all the time about being remarkable and I hope you can see that having her in my life inspiring me to be more remarkable I don't even feel like a whole candle to you Missackins you always inspire me I remember one time somebody said they went off with you with some professional development they was been 23 years ago and they woke up at five in the morning and you were jumping rope and I think you were in your 50s then so you were a spring chicken and you're jumping rope and you've always exercised you always worked hard to eat right and you are just amazing and doing so well and you're still transforming lives and it's just who you are well I couldn't take my side by winning it but I and I'm trampoline so I had a mini trampoline I would jump rope jump jump jump on trampoline I don't even worry before I came to school and I'm in the bike but then I like a gape not rope with me that's right that's right well I hope you've enjoyed getting to meet Missackins she's an amazing woman I'll have a very much and I'm very grateful for her role in my life because honestly I went to her my junior year I didn't have the SATs I needed to get a Georgia Tech which was my dream college and way back this was back in 8586 she actually had computer software to help me improve my SAT score and my score went up about 200 points with a lot of hard work I was able to go to Georgia Tech and now I'm back here so you could say that I wouldn't be anything at all really without Missackins believing in me and helping me and helping every child I think that's what it's about it's about reaching every child where they are and helping them meet meet their needs and to be the very best that they can be so thanks for listening Missackins always said that every child was a winner she knew that every child had the capacity to win inside them let me tell you about another inspiring educator Mrs. Sharon Howard when I sat down with her for this next interview it was in 2021 as she was retiring from a 44 year career as a kindergarten teacher at Sherwood Christian Academy and that year in 2021 she actually did not miss a day of in person's goal back when I started at Sherwood Christian Academy as their IT director and computer science and digital film teacher I was looking for the teacher leaders much of this comes from what I learned from Carrie Patterson in his book The Inbulenceer where he talks about the informal leaders who drive a school Mrs. Howard was one of those leaders and I knew that we would be successful in technology transformation when she told other teachers in the school that she could and would innovate like a turtle and she would learn new things about technology and then she went on to lead the school to create a program where every kindergarten student could use a Kindle device to read and play educational games. She became a technology leader not because she loved technology but because she loved children and knew we needed to harness technology to teach children the best. Mrs. Howard taught K5 kindergarten and her children learned to read from the first day I thought of this Howard when I read research mentioned about organizational psychologists at him grant in his book Hidden Potential the Science of Achieving Greater Things he shared how studies reveal that the influence of a kindergarten teacher extends far beyond the classroom potentially forecasting an individual's financial success in adulthood for a class of 20 students and above average kindergarten teacher could be worth an additional lifetime income of $320,000. If you look at her results through the years you will see that Mrs. Howard is an exceptional teacher. Now she is just telling it like it is from her experience and I fully know that some of the things she says might be different from what you hear from popular motivational educational speakers, things like all of kindergarten should be playtime. However, if you hear the testimonies of the parents and the students who took Mrs. Howard's class you'll hear that they are spectator, loved her class cried when they couldn't come to school and that students were transformed at home into happier, healthier, more helpful children. So I hope you'll listen to what she says because how she talks to us on this podcast is also how she would talk to her students with respect, simplicity and using words in meaningful ways. Now Miss Howard and our friends and she makes me call her Sharon but I still look up to her and often talk to her about teaching when I see her at church. Now we'll talk to Mrs. Sharon Howard with an excerpt from episodes 748 of the 10-minute teacher podcast. Today we have a pleasure to interview one of my heroes, Miss Sharon Howard. She is a K5 teacher kindergarten teacher here at my school and she is retiring after 44 years of working with the students right now in May of 2021. She's just finished up one whole year in all of his pandemic of face-to-face instruction. I don't think I'll miss today. Did you miss Howard? They did not miss one day every single day with her kindergarten face-to-face so she is a remarkable woman and so Miss Howard you are retiring. How does that feel to think about because teaching has been such a part of your life, hasn't it? Oh yes, yes definitely. That's been my main goal is to maintain my family, the best that I could. My husband was very supportive most of the time he was up here after he retired to help me with bulletin boards and all of my book collection because that's what I've done for 44 years is collect children's books. Actually retired discussion something was very interesting that was said. A person who had a child who was a behavior problem before he came to you said his wife at parent teacher night before school starts that down with you and said what are you going to do when my child miss behaves? What was your answer in why? Well I just explained to the mom she wanted to have my discipline procedures and I said I don't plan on having any discipline issues right from the very first day of school I set high standards for my children and I think a lot of it has to do with the way that I talk to them and come across meaning business that this is big school now, this is not daycare and I give them a sense of confidence and excitement for what we're going to do, what we're going to learn and our day always started with our Bible which set the tone for the rest of our day. And was the star student that I had no problems with with him. Yeah. So literally your plan was not having a discipline problem. That's true. Now all children are different. They come to you with all different personalities. They are some who like to take charge but that was part of my strategy is setting up where I stood in the class and what I expected of them. And yes, if there were times where somebody was trying my patients to see how far I would go, I gave them three strikes and you're out. So if I had to speak to them three different times for the same offense, then that meant three times and you will give me some of your play time. Okay. Did that, does that happen very much? No. No. It didn't happen any this year? No. None of the more it's not even once. I think my first year was Howard. I probably had 50 or 100 trips to the office but of the kids, it was a disaster my first year was but I can say in three years I think I've had to refer one student to the office because you do kind of get to where you understand how to prevent discipline problems don't you? Yes. I always told my parents that if I have a school issue at school, I like to try to handle it between me and the student first. When it gets to the point that the child is not willing to work with me, that's when I give them the option. You can either work with me or we will give mom and dad a call and we will involve them. So I tried to give them choices, right? That was the way that I taught them to grow and mature and start making good choices that pertain to themselves. And your history speaks for itself because we well named names that I can think of many many children who came to you that were quite the handful for their parents and their parents are just amazed at the beautiful traits formation of their children to be such helpful and successful students as well as successful in their homes. So you've got your discipline plan is not a have a problem, which is awesome. What advice do you wish that you had known in the earlier years of your teaching? Well, I think the idea of expecting high standards and high ideals for my children, it's a transition from a K4 class to a K5 class. There's a big difference in that child and they're coming out of that playtime syndrome and they're coming into what I call real school because not many students in K5 learn to read to write, learn to their numbers. So we were a structured educational school and that was part of setting high standards for the children and getting them to make that transition was a big life change not only for them but also for their parents because their parents would see things that ways that I did stuff at school and the children knew me well enough that they went home and said but Miss Howard says like what's it to learn? Miss Howard does it this way that especially came true the second half of our year when the student was required to have reading homework three nights a week and I always had parent conferences just before we made the transition and I would instruct the parents on a good procedure to follow with homework so it would be consistent with what the child was doing at school and we would not be conflicting one way with another way and that was very helpful. I gave them blend ladders. I showed them how I sounded out the letters how I made words and then carrying it a step further to use the words and sentences and parents said well well I'm not even falling at that to them and so once they saw how I did it and got a feel for it when the child would come home and say but Miss Howard does it this way and they would listen to the child because that was what the child was used to doing and they wanted it to be consistent at home so we really believe in here at our school partnering with parents oh yes so you're not assuming that parents know how to teach this you're partnering with them and that's right well the phonetic way of teaching reading has not always been taught in the schools and a lot of the parents I've had through the years would sit down and say you know Miss Howard I never was taught phonics thank you for showing me how to teach phonics to my child and it just kind of seemed to make sense to them so in your K5 kindergarten year about when are most if not all students reading well we start reading right from the first day of school because our first letter that we introduced for teaching the sounds and the recognition and writing is we start with the five short vowels that's our base then after we've covered each of the vowels that they carry a short sound we didn't go into long that comes later but then we would start adding the consonants which then we could make a blend and then the next step is to learn a consonant that we could add as a final consonant and we've got words we're reading so I always tell my children just because we're changing to reading groups and we have a reader we've been reading since the first of schools in how does it change a child when they start reading well when they pick up a book off of my children's library shelf and I tell them we start with a sight word that I said don't just look at the pictures now you look at the words see if you can find that sight word the and you can see them they'll be sitting there counting the sound I saw so instead number of those on this page so that gets them then interested in the words and it's amazing to parents when they're driving around in the car and the child sees a sign and said oh look mom that's selling so and parents say oh you know we're not just reading it's gold but now they're learning it and they're able to read it out in public one thing you do extremely well as you mentor younger teachers so when you have a new younger teacher come to you and what are some of the things that you tell them as they're starting out teaching kindergarten or younger students well that can apply to any teacher who's going into a new grade level you know what do I do first I always tell them you get with your partner teacher you find out what fame you're going to be doing the first of school so that you can get your room decorated get it put your personality into it and then you got ready to set up your daily schedule find out what your et cetera classes are going to be get you a time schedule then you can plan out the subjects and look at the first week of school for plans don't look at the whole year and become overwhelmed and that way you start out slow and you build from there so you're less in plan for the first week and your schedule daily schedule then you feel like you're getting your feet on the ground and you can kind of see your direction so what am I meant to her is the baby shiver you got me into teaching always said great teachers or repeaters so pick which you repeat because that's what the kids will remember so miss Howard what are the things you repeat over and over to your classes and have for all these years well students need to know right up front what your classroom rules are and you constantly are referring to them that's why I always posted my discipline procedure right under the board at the front of the room and one of them says I will raise my hand to speak and so you know all I had to do was say and I left to sing a song I raised my hand when I want to speak so that cuts the people who are yelling out or who are jumping up and down because I tell them you know I don't look at popcorn I look for the people who are raising their hand quietly and patiently waiting their turn so that gets the procedure in your classroom set up right away and then that just continues I know in earlier days I would sing a lot of my directions because that gets their ear to something else they hear you constantly speaking and you start giving out reminders or directions they tune you out but you start with a song then that's going to kind of pull them back in to your attention and I'll always remember one little boy with turn around and he'd say to the people it is table how does she keep singing so you see you didn't like it but it made an impression on him and that was just another tool but you just have five rules yes what are your five rules now last one is keep your keep your teacher happy so some matter is it a keypapy they're not me some teachers that are pretty hard to keep happy all right well you follow the first four which is followed directions quickly and if there were some who were kind of dragging then I would start counting and I would say you should be prepared by the time I get to three raise your hand so that not everyone is speaking and I also like to start teaching them public speaking and k5 and that meant that when we were having large group learning time in phonics or in Bible or numbers and I asked a question I would ask him to please stand to speak so that kind of gave them some confidence they had to think on their feet what am I going to say how am I going to say it that also helped then later in the year when we had reading groups they would stand to read out loud that kind of gives them the floor it gives the others a chance to hear them some of the shy ones I would teach them to project their voice so that we could all hear them and it was amazing how that kind of reading had an effect on the people sitting in their chairs doing seatwork because they were tuned in to what they were doing on their desk that they were also listening to what was going on and I've always had the first great teachers to come back and say wow Miss Howard your students stand when I asked them a question she said I love it you know everybody's expected to do public speaking even when you meet someone for the first time you need to be confident and you need to know you know how to think on your feet so I like to start that in K5 that's another way of teaching this group that they're in big school now I love that so raise your hand for permission to speak and then you have roll number three raise your hand for permission to leave your seat right if they need to use the restroom or they need to get a tissue or they need to get project off of the cabinet that just kind of gives them permission to get up and walk around they didn't just have free for all and just get up and like during reading groups I had a rule if we had a color cut and paste project and they held their scraps in the corner of their desk until we either changed reading groups or reading groups were over that way you don't have people being distracted in seatwork time or in the reading group and then you have makesmark choices number four and keep your dear teacher happy number five right you see K5 is also a time where they're thinking about choices just like when I discipline a child I always tell them why they can't do whatever they're trying to do and second I want them to think do I want to keep acting silly or do I want to play the full time out at PE now later in the year the time out kind of gets a little bit boring for the K5 so where my classroom was situated was said that the student who did have time out I would start having them just stay in their seat with their head down all the while they could hear what was going on on the playground they could hear them running and playing and so you know so you but you don't have to do that a lot because you know there's some folks who say oh don't take away playground it's not like you have to do it but you know that's why you want them to make the choice but you're putting it out there that if they decide no I don't want to stop then it was their choice right to stay in right and so I like for parents to know that all said you teach public speaking which most people would say wow for kindergarten or she teach the structure of learning you help the parents learn how to teach the phonics and set those procedures so that you can consistently partner together. Now this year truthfully so many people were expecting that you would retire last summer 2020 with the pandemic going on and nobody would have lined you you know because you work with five girls and yes they were their mask but you know how well they were their mask they're five or six so tell us a little bit about why you decided you need to teach one more year. Well I was excited when I heard that our school was going to go into zones which made me feel a little more confident because I know that a lot of the older students we have middle school and high school they're more out and about and that's kind of a good way for it to spread and I like the fact that the preschoolers were in their own wing. We had our lunch here we had our et cetera classes our library and would come to us to read to some our music was done in a room down in our zone and to me that was a good security I felt safe and the students got out of their car they walked through the front door of the school and their temperatures were checked and then they came right into our zone and the only other time that we left our hallway except to go to the playground but the opposite end was how we entered or exited our zone and we would take them out into the lobby put them in their car and they were gone we did not even go to the gym nauseum that often because we had to cross the zone and go through the high school wing so the coaches worked out in classroom activities for the PE time and I will say this I had less absences and my K5 class this year than I think any year I've taught because you know how preschoolers they pick up colds they pick up stomach viruses all of this and it it was just wonderful most of my students were here every single day now some of them would go out of town with their parents and maybe miss a Friday or something but there were no cases of flu so I was very strict as everyone was about cleanliness and we had our own space and during activity time they could stand it through asking kind of talk to their neighbors around their neighborhood and but they did not pair up and sit together and play with the same activity and then each day the activities that they used I would give them a name stick and they would put the name stick in the top of their activity container and they used that activity for the week on the days that we had morning activities then at the end of the week I would take the name sticks out and then put the activities out in the hall and our aid would come and disinfect each set so then on Monday everything was fresh and clean and we started over lunchtime was done right at our own desk they did not get up and walk around but when they were finished with their food I picked up their trash with gloves and mask I didn't let them get up and start walking around and dropping stuff everyone of my children came in knowing how to wash their hands and it all said so I knew that parents had been working with them at home and they would stand there and they would do the 20 second or better washing time and we just had good disinfectant that I started the day with they came into a clean desk they had their own separate cubbies to hang their coats put their lunchbox their boot bags and their rest mats also stayed separated so it was just wonderful year this year I feel at peace with this decision that I have made as does my husband now I'm in the process of setting up a resource room to leave with my preschool department my collection over 44 years of collecting children's books I have I'm sitting right now around 12 huge tubs full of books and they are already correlated to go with our resource units they're numbered and we're going to set up a resource room so that the preschool teachers will have access to the books because that was another very, very important learning tool to me was reading to my children and they always always said oh Miss Howard we have time for storage for you and story time was an important time as well so as you look back over the 44 years you know every teacher should have things they stand for what do you feel like the things are that you stand for you and your career as a teacher? well first and foremost I would like to be known as a teacher who love the Lord who saw to it in her classroom that her children were spiritually settled in a good foundation I like to use my Bible time not just to tell a Bible story of what happened back in Bible days but how does that Bible story relate to me today? what can I learn from that Bible story and the the verses that we learned to memorize and sing you know how does that apply to me and my theme for my children for many years has been God has a plan for your life and you need to stay in the word and you know they'll say but Miss Howard I don't know what I want to be when I grow up I said that's fine I said but God is working with you God's giving you interests that will give you ways that when you're older you know what God is giving you the desire to do and I said that's the way he leads you into where he wants you to go so that has been my theme yeah yes and you had a graduating senior last year who was quite rainbow just as a K5 and named you his star teacher yes he was and I always used him as an example to my children because our media center sets up a reading summer reading challenge and the parents are to write down the books and the number of pages that the children read during the summer and they bring that list back to their first great teacher and then awards are given first second and third place for the children in first grade who read the most pages and the day that I introduced summer reading group to this young man he got in the car and he said mama I'm gonna win that trophy in first grade and she did not have to remind him ask him how he read I also encouraged him to go to the public library get their own reading card now that they were going into first grade which is another great incentive to go to the library and he did win that first place award and his mom said I never had to encourage him or remind him so yes it was a surprise you never think of senior in high school remembering what happened and their kindergarten class you're getting ready to hand off to another generation of teachers what is your dream in your wish for kindergarten teachers all over the world as they look at moving forward next year and the kids come back well I certainly would love for them to have confidence and know that beyond a shadow of an edge out they have the heart and the love for the great that they're teaching that should be first when you feel that you're in the right place then you're going to feel happy and encouraged and that's gonna get your creative juices going so that you can make an enhance your curriculum and hands your program give them those little extra things that make the kids want to jump out of that car in the morning and get to school I mean I've had children cry because they woke up with fever and couldn't go to school but I want to go see Miss Howard well you have to have something here that gives them that go to get up and get up get here and so you yourself have got to have that feeling second establish your expectations just what do you expect of these gay five children or whatever grade you're teaching because each grade level is preparing them for something bigger so you need to you know think about where they are what they should be able to do now and then giving them the confidence to come into your class and and and and do it but the love for you has for teaching has got to start in your heart and then as you continue you will have a heart for teaching that keeps you growing keep you excited and you're always thinking about how could I do that different next year every year you're going to learn that things never every year you're going to have new students every year you're going to have a different class of people so you're going to constantly be changing just just because the students that you have and then when the time comes that you feel at this is where you should all the line and for others younger then you will leave with a heart that says I know I did my best I have done my job and I feel that the Lord is happy with what has taken place yeah my biggest point about retirement number one on my retirement last is self care because I feel that it's time now for me to self care myself so I'm going to have special place in my home which already have place where I sit if I don't do anything but just sit and think it's a rocking chair but it's a place where I can have my devotions I can pray and I can also stay there and listen to the Lord speak that to me. Of course enjoy being at home, joy you know my husband but self care now is what I think is needed because retirement is a huge life change very much and you've got to take care of yourself and you've got to establish your routine now so I'm looking forward to it it's an exciting time but it's also sad time to be pack it up what we're I've been living for the last few years but I'm happy to know that I'm leaving my legacy of children's books and resources that I have collected over the years and hope that through this material a seed will be planted in that child's heart to help them grow in mature. Well thank you for listening to this extended episode with one of my heroes Miss Howard I know there were some days for me where I would get nervous about coming to school the news has been just off of the charts or off the chain as the kids will say and I would think to myself Miss Howard is I sat my derangue in the back parking lot Miss Howard here today I won't get up here put on my mask and do it too it's been an interesting year but it has been an important year and thank you for finishing so well and for telling your story thank you Miss Howard thank you very much for being here and joy it.
