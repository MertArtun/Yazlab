 Welcome to the UpClosed Podcast. Your home for conversations about the present and future of public education. On today's episode we're going to explore one of the most critical issues facing this country and that is a teacher, shortage and educator shortage. Now more than at any time in recent memory we know that educators are leaving the profession and alarming rates. A national survey that was conducted by the National Education Association earlier this year revealed that a whopping 55% of educators are considering leaving the profession earlier than planned. And yet we know that a quality public education starts with quality educators. We need quality educators and education support professionals in our public education system. So here with us today we are so honored that with us today we have someone who is uniquely and distinctly qualified to speak to this issue to help us to understand it and to know how it is being addressed and how it can be addressed and how we all can contribute to meeting this need in our country. I am so honored to welcome and to introduce to some and to introduce to others, President Becky Pringle, President of the NEA, the National Education Association, Welcome Becky. It's good to be with you Sarah. Let me tell you a little bit about President Pringle. Becky has the awesome task of leading more than 3 million educators and education support professionals who are members of the NEA in this country. She is a former middle school teacher. She has more than 31 years of classroom experience and she is very well known for in particular putting educators and students first in a way that is focused on transforming public education into a racially and socially and just an equitable system that can prepare every student to succeed in a diverse world. So we are just so honored. I will tell you that during her time with the NEA among her other accomplishments, President Pringle has co-chair the NEA's task force on school discipline and a school to present pipeline. But let me tell you something. If I were to enumerate all of President Pringle's accomplishments, we would be here all day. So at this point, I am just going to welcome Becky again and once again say how excited we are to have this important conversation with you as we look to the future of public education. Let's dive in. Earlier this year, the NEA published a report on the educator shortage that is gripping the nation's public schools and through that report, you outlined a long list of research-based solutions effective at recruiting and retaining educators and most importantly, reflecting the needs and priorities of educators themselves. So from where you sit, can you tell us why you think educators are at this time rethinking their place in the teaching profession and the education profession and whether or not they can remain as educators. Sarah again, it's so good to be with you. I want to emphasize the part of my bio that talks about experience and education. I taught middle school science. Yes, there's a special place in heaven for me and other middle school teachers. I taught middle school middle level learners, the joys of science for over 30 years. So when I talk about the educated crisis, I talk about it from a place of experience knowledge as an educator. Now as president of the NEA, not only do I have that experience as a leader in the association, I'm bringing to bear the full force, weight, power, strength of the largest labor union in the country, but I do it from that lens of being a teacher. This is not a new crisis. This is chronic. It has existed when I was in a classroom and it exists now. It's like with everything else, the pandemic made it worse because that's what the pandemic did. And the pandemic. Honestly, helped us shine a light on something that we've been talking about and trying to sound the alarm around for many, many years. And so the report that we, that the NEA issue and it's one of the things that I insist on because of the conversations that I had with educators all over this country when I did what I called my Georgia since an excellent store. And I just asked educators teachers and supports that. Notice counselors aspiring educators and we can educate this questions. Just ask questions and help us. I'm just sharing with what their hopes and dreams were, what the concerns were, helped me understand why we saw in our survey, 55% of our educators talking about leaving the pressure to help me understand that. And not just the why, but what would, what could change that would, would change their minds about about leaving. And so the report is full of research based solutions, as you said, and I want to emphasize it, it really is the voice and experience of our educators when we talk about those solutions. And Sarah, I'm sure you know, I know you've heard this work because educators everywhere are using this work, they tell me that it's about respect and I get that. I absolutely get that. As a teacher, we never, you know, had the level of respect and support that we should have had, should have as the professionals we are. When I asked him to peel that away, you know, kind of dig into that, what does that look like? What does respect look like to you? They were very clear about what that looked like to them. And they started with being treated as the professionals they are. And for them, that meant that they had the authority and the collective autonomy to make teaching and learning decisions for their students. Mm-hmm. But it meant for them is that they had a, that they earned a professional salary that reflected the important role they played in our society. What it meant for them is that they got to make professional decisions about how they spent their time in a way that they could attend to the individual needs of students could welcome and who parents as partners could collaborate with their, with their colleagues. For them, it meant us treating the teaching profession as a continuum of practice, professional practice. At the front end, as they were preparing, as aspiring educators to become teachers and to continue to focus on improving their professional practice. And then having those opportunities to lead in their professions, they talked about all of those things. Um, and they talked about the reality that they can't do it by themselves and share responsibility. We say every student that we actually mean every student will succeed. So we need all of the social systems surrounding our children with them or they mean so they are ready to ready to come to school prepared to learn every day. Thank you so much, Becky, for sharing all of that. And there's so many things that you've said that I'd like to follow up on. You've spoken about how educators want choice and autonomy as they lead in their classrooms and the opportunity to innovate. And I think that for those who've not been in a classroom, they might imagine, well, of course, that's what educators do, that's what educators have the opportunity to do. But you talk about it as something that educators are hoping for more of, what are the barriers right now to exercise to exercising that autonomy? Well, first of all, everyone who ever went to school thinks they know what teachers and other educators do and feel that they should make decisions about what it looks like to be able to say that all of our students are prepared to take that next step in their learning journey. They are prepared to enter the workforce and to earn salaries that they can take here the family and say, are prepared to go on to college if that's what they choose to do or go on to technical training, additional training that they are prepared to be the leaders of a just society and participate fully in our democracy, all of those things that we want for our students. They are trained. They go to school as you very well know. They have to graduate and be licensed and they have to have content skills, knowledge, skills and ability as well as pedagogical skills, all of those things and it's continuous training. All of that goes in to making those key decisions so that we can meet students where they are and help them along their learning journey. And so when I talk about professional authority and collective and I end up very intentional about using that word, Sarah, when I say collective authority, it's not that I don't want anyone to get an idea in their head that teachers should go into their classes and close their doors and not collaborate with the colleagues. It doesn't suggest that we as educators don't know and embrace the responsibility for continuous learning with our colleagues and with others. So that's why you use that phrase intentionally, collective authority that we're making decisions that are best for our students in collaboration with others, other educators with our parents, with the students themselves, so much needs to be attended to around student agents in their own learning. So all of those things go in for educators go into that concept of a professional authority and collective autonomy. What do you think can be done a present-pringle to increase those opportunities for educators and to open the door and to let them know that they have the respect, they deserve, they have the support, they deserve. Well, first of all, they are in positions with it making decisions. You know, I've used this word a lot myself and we use it a lot. We talk about we talk about educator voice and absolutely their voice is paramount to getting it right for students but it can't just be voice. It can't be oh my goodness well we're going to invite you to share what you think but we're going to make decisions. We are the designers and we'll be making the decisions and there's have to be in that scene of decision making and then say say before not an isolation but they have to be able to make those decisions. That's what it looks like for them. They have to know that they have the resources that they need to meet the needs growing needs. We could talk about that on a whole other segment. Yes, you know. It's always been true that students bring the all the ills and challenges of society right to our school outsourced. That's always been true but it certainly has grown over the years and after the pandemic even more so the trauma, the social and emotional needs, all of that and in the school needs that. And so we have to have the resources to do the jobs we love. We have to address the fact that we've disinvested in public education for decades we can't just make up with a one-time infusion of money. We've got to make that up in a way that we imagine our system and a way that we fund it in an equitable way that all of our students all of them get what they need. I love the passion with which you you provide that response and you touch on something that is also really kind of close to my heart because I've been at this nexus of ed advocacy, education advocacy and philanthropy for a while and one of the things that grieves me is when philanthropies and other funders believe that they because of some research perhaps that they have done feel that they have a solution that now should be executed by educators. Where educators have not been central in the formation of those ideas and those practices and so forth. I think if there I don't know that there's necessarily a question when I have just said but it's further common on what you have said. It's so important that educator voice and educator leadership is shaping instructional practice and more in schools. I don't know before I'm going to take a little bit of a left term. I don't know if you want to jump in further. I do. I love the way you just phrase that to us. I want to lift it up that educators are central. Central in the formation of ideas and I would add because sometimes that happens and then it takes on this other reality because then educators are not then central to the implementation and central into ensuring that the resources are there. They've got to be central in each of those pieces because we've got lots of ideas. I don't know if you and I say or we'll talk about our, you know, one of our loves that we share and that is community schools but that's an example I can give you many because like I said I've been around a minute. So I see good ideas that educators actually promoted get implemented in a way that just that's loosely are not founded or executed in a way that the educators would imagine or certainly would do themselves. So it's got to be central to the formation of the ideas, central to the implementation, central to the assessment, right? And the learning where educators want to continuously learn and what we call, it was I could come up with a better term than this but what we call scoping and scaling and you and I are doing them. I'm not sure I want to use that phrase but you know what I mean. Yes, spreading the learnings and in a way that we have identified those core or and key principles but not that we're lifting it from this place and clapping it in another place and saying do this and you'll be fine. No, that actually flies in the face of that what they've been collaborative autonomy so that that school, that community is a part of it, right? And they own it and it's about them and it reflects their highest ideas. So I wanted to I love that you said it that way and I wanted to expand on that. Thank you so much and I want to take a little bit of a turn back because you know this issue of educator voice and celebrating, recognizing first and then celebrating the contributions of educators not only to their classrooms but to communities such a critical thing to explore but we know that amid the national crisis there is even a further deepening crisis among educators of color and are growing not are growing but are longstanding me to see more educators of color in the profession. Can you talk a little bit about what you learn through your report preparation of that report and what the NEA's position is now on this issue of the particular increasing teachers of color in this country. So you're right that it's a long time issue. There's no question about that and I want to talk about it from this perspective and in your first question you asked about the attracting and retaining and especially in this conversation so we have to pay attention to the to the retention piece of things. This is a question that the number of college students of color who are making the choice to go into education has declined. We know that is true. And I'm struggling with saying it out wherever they leave at such a higher rate. Yeah that it is the retention problem is almost more critical. Yes. And so I want to call attention to that and I'm going to lift up the work of Dr. Ivory Tolson who is an extraordinary work in higher education and has supported our work around HBCUs and MSI's. And he really was the first one to kind of grab my face and said, you know, Becky, we appreciate that you're lifting that up that we need more students of color to go in. But you need to be aware of the retention issue because not aware of that. Not only are you not going to solve the retention issue, you really in looking at the retention issue, it actually helps you on the attracting piece of things. And so we see digs down into that in his research which I really encourage you to listen to to dig into it. But does expose some of those things that we have to address on both sides. So one of the things with teachers of college students of color choosing teaching and then after they get into teaching if they choose it, staying in teaching. And so I believe that in this country, we have never and it's just gotten worse. Addressing issue of the cost of higher education. We, you know, so we have students of color who are graduating, passive amounts of debt. Why you not uniquely impacting them in a debt at a rate. That's because of students of color 10 to come from the families that don't have generation or well, that's an overstayment. And they don't, they don't have parents that maybe can step in and take over those loans. So they're starting their career where they have mountains of debt. They're putting off having families, they're making choices about, you know, where they live or what they can do. And they then say, I can't do it. And they leave. And students in college are making that decision too. And looking at teaching and saying, wait a minute, I am accumulate knowledge that, and I can't, I can't, I can't choose teaching. It's a rare cause I know I'm not going to, I'm never going to earn the kind of pay that's commensurate with the work that I do. And so I'm directly, that address it at the same thing. The other thing that I do, the other things I want to highlight, you know, we talk about diversifying the profession. Yes, oftentimes, and we point to the impact, we have research on this. The impact that a teacher of color can have on a student of color, especially multiple teachers of color having them in a room. But we also have evidence, Sarah, that that having a diverse workforce impacts why students too. Absolutely. Absolutely. Got to tell both both sides of the story. And then the last thing I'll also, I think, go on and on about it. But the last thing I want to lift up is, and this comes directly from our students, our Spy Rage Occupators, as well as our early career educators of color. And that is that they get into the profession or they're aspiring to it. And they just don't have that support system. That now works in the unique circumstances, they find them. And so those are the kinds of things that we heard from them. And those are the kinds of programs that any A is putting in place. And with institutions of higher education, we're partnered with the Department of Education and others to try to specifically address this need that our students and educators of color have lifted up for us. And many of us have, we have great hope for that work and how it will continue and help to transform this experience, the situation. We know also Becky, this another dimension of that, which is grievous and which our listeners may not be aware of folks now talk about is the life-o issue, the fact last and first out. And as we have a hope to recruit and retain more teachers of color, it also is a practice across many industries and professions that those who are last hired by a place tend to be the ones who if mixer-of-actors require some reduction they are then the first to go. And of course, that's counterproductive to our desire to see a growth in teachers of color across the country. What is the position of the NEA on that? And what what do you think can be done so that this doesn't become sort of a two steps forward, one step back, phenomenon? So Sarah, that's an example of an issue where if you address it from a place of contention and size instead of collaboration, particularly in this instance, labor management, I'll be specific, labor management collaboration, which is an initiative that NEA has partnered actually with national partners, national support, it's part of the school administrators with the NEA have come together and partnered to promote what we call labor management collaboration. And the reason I bring that up in this context is because it's all, you know, life-o. It's always brought up in a way that the unions are the reason why, because of contracts, that's why we have to let the last thing go first. When we know that for us, we are about collaborating with others to absolutely best, the job we possibly can for our students and for our educators, go, you know, always tying back to the fact that we need more educators and we need to support them. And so we've seen and been a part of and work with locals and the most recent way of which is our local in Minneapolis and Minnesota where we talked about that various, having more a disproportionate number of our teachers of color, just coming into the profession, and then they would be the ones that were targeted to leave or be fired. So first of all, the way we approached it, they are in another places is why, why, why, why, why we're doing that, we need more teachers. So let's just, why, why is anybody leaving? Why is that happening? That shouldn't be happening. So what are we doing to resource that to that district? So then they're not letting go of any educators. We need more. So the West Side Bayer and come together and collaborate together to get the resources so that we have, we can lower those class eyes. Nobody's leaving. We're bringing more in. So there's that. Additionally, we know when we use it, when we talk about it from that contentious place, you know, we talk about it as though other educators are expendable, that that's not true. We need our middle, we need our mid-career teachers, our world has a mid-career educators as mentors. So that's why it's so important to build the processing systems and structures to support collaboration throughout the system so that we have all of the educators. The new, new, mid and veteran educators, there's a color in every category. Educators are bringing a wealth of experience to you, geographically, in other diversity in other way and not track this issue up as a false choice in which it should not be. But we have the collaborate together and it should never be used as a way to suggest that we are not working to diversify our profession. While I am so appreciative of that statement and especially President Pringle how throughout and responding you have underscored again and again the importance of collaboration, I think, you know, at this time in our country's experience, we're learning across industries and professions that this skill and will and ability to engage in collaborative solution making is the way forward and anything that contributes to contention is counter our nations, best, and nations plural, best interest, right? So I really, really appreciate that you you, you, obliquely mention the community schools earlier in our past to podcasts, have focused on community schools but they're again, right, as in solution making for increased educational justice in this country, the basic premise is one of collaboration, it is certainly something that I know the N E A and the N E A foundation prioritized heavily. As we think about those kinds of collaborations now as we turn towards solutions and what can be done to turn around this crisis of teachers and other educators and education support professionals leaving classrooms in schools and school districts and their communities, what could be done collaboratively because we know it's a shared responsibility, it's a part of the public interest that there is adequate support for educators and so what can be done first and foremost around this issue of teacher pay, appropriate compensation, what are the recommendations that are being put forth by the N E A and that respect? So we're using strategies to address the issue of teacher pay. So first of all, we're pushing our partners, our NRLIs of course, but also others in business, philanthropy, they need to use their own bully puppets to say, we need to respect, celebrate, use that word before, honor and pay our teachers in a way that that's commensurate with the important work that they do and play in this society. We know that public education is the foundation of this democracy and so for those people who have made that choice to educate America's students, we've got to collectively own that responsibility to elevate the profession. So I wanted to say that. For us at the N E A, it is about using a variety of strategies. So it's a union of course, we're going to use our strategy of collective bargaining where we can and we have work with our locals to use that to not only be strongly for increases in pay, but to do a couple of things. First of all, you know, Sarah that we were fought, fought, fought, really hard to make sure that we had elected leaders and appointed leaders who believed in public education and would support our students, public schools and educators and so in the passage of the American Rescue Plan that didn't just happen, that was a lot of effort for that to make that happen, getting the right people in place and then making sure that they took on their responsibility to change what was happening. And that was a huge opportunity for a certainly round community schools for sure, but also around raising the pay of teachers and getting more, not just teachers, our supports, staff and as well as our counselors and nurses and all of the folks that we know we are seeing in the need. So using collective bargaining to pay for higher salaries is a strategy of course that we've used before. Not all of our states have the ability to use collective bargaining so we've been using strategies like the one we use in Louisiana where our affiliate there use the legislature to teach your salaries and pay salaries and we just benefit. And so we use a variety of strategies to advocate for and demand higher salaries. And we know that all of that then I said this before, I'm Sarah, so we use the American Rescue Plan to, in this moment address some of those things, but we've got to have that longer-tone strategy because we know that we've got to address the decades long, disinvestment in our public schools that brings us to where we are now. We can't teach your pay if our schools aren't being adequately resource. We have to address that at every level, have to address it at the local level. So fighting to raise revenues at the local level, changing how public schools are funded and having them tied to the housing. We know automatically sets up a system of inequity. So we have to address it at the local level. We have to address it at the state level. The majority of funding for our schools comes at the state level. So we have to absolutely fight that at the state legislature, fight for that at the state legislature and then of course the federal government's role. One of the things that people don't always tie to what I just said is the federal government's promise to fund the fund IDEA, which is the individuals with disabilities education act, the provides resources for our students with special needs at a rate of 40%. And they never did that. And that means that the local and state have to pick that up. And so the federal government has a role to play not just in general education funding, but specifically in special education funding. So funding is a key piece of the work we have to do to raise salaries for educators. And then lastly, I want to mention this, you know, we've talked about which, which we call a wage penalty gap, which is existed again forever. But after the pandemic, we saw it rise throughout the pandemic. It went from around 20% to now it's a little over 25%. That means that similarly situated professions in terms of experience and education teachers earn 25% less. That's not okay. That is a societal issue that we have to address from the highest levels of our government. It is a societal issue. Indeed, and there are so many things you said I'd like to pick up on. You said quickly, but I'd like to go back to something that the NEA foundation is also fierce about. And that is that the preservation and furtherance of public education is in the public interest. Public education is a public good. So I believe that as the NEA does such powerful work in collective bargaining and so forth, so is building public will for public education. And I'm just interested in your thoughts about that of course, you know, this is this also is not new. It does seem that a mid-Somony other really pressing issues the country is facing. There is this question of public education as a public good. Can you talk about absolutely, and I just would add a public good and that's the foundation of this democracy? Absolutely. Yes, we know. Yeah, and that's why, you know, that's our founding more principles that, you know, that every, every one of our students has access to a quality, high quality, public education. And we know that an educated citizen of students who are prepared to think critically and make and solve problems collaboratively, we know our absolutely essential to our country living into its promise. Yeah, we the people, we the people, we the people, all of us have that right to pursue happiness to be truly free. For that to be a reality for everyone, we've got to ensure that all of our students have that high quality public education. And it cannot be based on the zip code. It can't be based on the families, generational or current economic status. It can okay, it can't be based on race. It has to be based on their birthright as, you know, an American or for those who've come to our country as immigrants, making sure that they have those opportunities. I mean, they're not kept from those opportunities because they don't have funds to do it. So our country was founded on that. And we know that we have a whole lot of additional work to do, especially in public education because Sarah, we both know that the system of public education as it was established in this country was never designed to be a racial and socially just and at the most, it just wasn't, it wasn't and what helped us design. And that's why you, and you know, we, those of us, those of us who, I would call the believers in the folks who are upholding this every day, every, where, and every conversation that we continue to drive that home that we've got to transform that system into into one that works for all of our students. Because if we do that, if we create a system that works for our most marginalized students, it will increase the opportunity for all of our students. And that is how our country will live into its promise. I believe that very much myself as does the whole of the NEA foundation. I know, Becky, as we near the close of our time together, I'd like to ensure that even amid the many challenges that you've loosedated on this, on this call, what you see as, I'd like to lift up what you see as really promising and encouraging and what you, if you could, have a wish list of things that would happen that would provide that, that critical support that you've talked about for educators and the public support in particular, what's on your wish list for, if I, I don't mean to diminish it by calling it a wish list. I'm just trying to say in the most hopeful of perspectives, what are we looking for? So we're, we're looking for racial, social, and education justice for students, for educators, for communities. That's really at the core for me, it's at the core of everything. And you know, when people say to me, Becky, that's a big old aspirational vision, you just, you know, all students, all schools, all educators are excelled again, everyone knows it. And for us to do that, to first, as a country, to truly embrace that, first of all, to union, honestly, to the work toward that, you, you, you always hear a common theme whenever I talk, and you heard it today. Absolutely. And that, that is a core, that core value of partnership. We can't, we can't do it alone. Within, even within our own our own association, Sarah, I've been talking about the concept of dynamic alignment that, you know, I love to say with a large slavery union in this country. We have 51 state affiliates. We have 14,000 locals. We have 3 million members. Unless and until we are lined in a way that's dynamic, so it's, it's a constantly learning and with, within among each other, we're reaching across and helping each other, and ways that, that, that magnify that strength and power. In ways that we can win for our students all the time every day. Until unless that happens, we're not going to reach that, that full potential. So you always hear that. And everything I say when you, so when you talk about a wish list, it is that we continue that work together in a dynamic and aligned way toward racial, social, economic justice in this country. And, and that is, and everything we do, and I will tell you, Sarah, every decision I make is steeped in that. Everything we do reflects that collaborative and collective responsibility for every one of our students. What a wonderful vision and certainly one that that we share in as well. And, you know, it's a good place to, to start to turn toward home in the, in this time together. One of the things that we certainly believe in and one of the reasons that we launched this podcast is that we do think that the preservation of public education is a public responsibility and we, one of the things that we have learned is that those who are tuning into this podcast more and more, those who are not just proponents of public education and its preservation, but they are individuals who want to contribute in some way. They want to be involved in solution making and they're not all educators. They come from all walks. So I always like to ask those who are on our podcast, if you could speak to the listeners that there's something that everyone can do, as pertains to this issue of a teacher shortage. What, how can the average person who's not in the classroom, you know, or or if someone is, what, what would you hope we would be doing to support this important vision of education justice and education in social justice generally? Because again, we believe there is a role that everyone can play. So I would ask everyone whether you're in education or you're not in education to understand and own the responsibility regardless. And that necessarily means that you must or should begin or continue your journey of awareness, around racial and social justice, build your capacity and you can do that individually, reading, you know, I'd love to recommend to folks, the some of us. I have a text, an important way to understand, you know, historically how we got to where we are and understand the interconnection of all the systems that impact us even today. So I'd like to recommend that so you could take that individual journey, learn and read and I would, I would appoint folks to pay a side at justice because it has lots of resources so you can do that. And then reach out to others and have critical conversations so that you can continue that learning and building up your, your muscle and and that kind of thing. Build partnerships, that's one of the things that any a has been really focused on at the federal level. Yeah, I mentioned the Department of Education, I'll mention the Department of Labor. One of the things that we're really proud about is our partnership with them in establishing the, the registered apprenticeships for teachers. That's something completely, you know, a hundred million dollars of partner laborers put in to partner with us to have registered apprenticeships so that educators, inspiring educators, whether they're in education or not, can earn while they learn and be mentored by teachers. That's part of the attracting and retaining piece of things. So think about what partnerships you can engage in in your communities, whether it's with with civil rights organizations or with parents or organizations, create space for student voice, you know, invite students into the conversations and give them that space and support them in their fight. I'm so proud of them and the fight that they waged to around gun violence, huge, huge was they did with us. So create that space for for for students and then I'll go back to something I said earlier, Asura, you know, we have to as participants in this democracy. We have to pay attention to the people we put in positions of power. So that necessarily means asking right questions and holding people accountable. Yeah, not just holding a accountable. I like to say, you know, being that wind beneath their wings, so they can they can govern in a bold and righteous and focused and compelling and just wait. Those are the kinds of things people can do right now today. Join us in our movement. But is so awesome and response back. Yeah, my goodness. I will probably be pulling out that statement independent of the podcast, including it in the podcast, but that's what you have just said about how everyone can contribute to public education and preservation further into public education and supporting educators is a message that needs to be told in various contexts over and over again. So thank you so much for that. So present Pringle, I always like to close these podcasts by asking those we are interviewing. If there is anything that they might like to add. So I'd like to see is there anything that I have not asked you or that you would want to add to this important conversation as president of the NEA? Oh, say, you know, I shared earlier that I was in the class for over 30 years. And I have to tell you that in these last two and a half years, as we all struggle through a pandemic and try to keep our students and educate as a community safe and continue to learn and deal with the trauma of being in a global pandemic. I have never never been more proud to call myself a teacher. Be an educator. As I am in this moment, as I had the opportunity to not only honestly hold in my arms teachers from all of this country as a cry. And I gave space for them to share their fears and challenges, but to see the light in their eyes. When I asked them what they were most proud of, that they had done or what they are aspiring to do on my gunna syrup, the light in their eyes and what they shared with me about what they were doing them, the innovation, what they were learning, how they were helping each other, how they were taking care and not only their kids, but they were taking care of other other people's families, even as their own family was struggling as we both in this pandemic. I have just never been proud of. And I would ask for everyone to celebrate our educators and what they have done in this moment, what they've always done honestly, but it's just one of the highest need, how they stepped up in ways who could never imagine. Take that time, please, to celebrate them, to lift them up, to say thank you. And to let them know, we got you. We got you. Wow, well President Pringol, it has been my great honor to have this time with you and to bring your voice to people through this podcast, your passion, your conviction, your commitment to public education and to educators across this country. It's just palatable. It comes through not found of your voice in in ways that are just rich and wonderful. And I listeners not unique. I hope that you have heard from President Pringol that there is a role that you can play and it is critically important at this time that we lift up, celebrate, elevate the voices, the leadership, the contributions of educators to this country. President Pringol, thank you so, so, so much for being with the up close podcast. I'm sure that we will continue this conversation at some point in the future, but thank you, thank you for today.
