 Welcome to another teacher talk session tonight tonight. We are going to have our 120 fifth session and we are having a different educator from different part of the world as usual and tonight we have a teacher trainer and educational consultant Ron Marraine and I think he is American but right now he lives in his living in Germany and I'm going to invite him and when he comes we are going to start our live session with him. Let me invite him. In for the session when he comes we are going to start the waiting for him to join just a moment. I have invited him and I'm waiting just a moment. Let me write. So he came from here. There he is. Yes. Hello. Hello. How are you? I'm fine. It's wonderful to see you. Just a moment. I'm trying to arrange my half-form. Can you hear me? Sometimes it happens like this. I think now it's better. Can you hear me? Why is that happening? My half-form. I'm trying to hear it from there. No. Can you? Can you hear you? No. Wonderful. All right. Ron it's great to see you here and before starting our live session I would like to say thank very much for accepting my invitation for teacher talks. It's really great honor to have you. Thank you for inviting me. Wonderful. Thank you very much. I know that we are all busy and I know that you are also very busy. So if you already we can start. Sure. Okay. I know about you but maybe our followers would like to know about you. So can you tell us about yourself a little bit and a little bit about your experience too? Well, I'm an American but I live in Germany. I've lived in Europe most of my adult life. I am an American. Yeah. And I speak three different languages fluently. Of course English. And Spanish and German. Because I live in Germany. I speak German every day. German is the language of communication for me. I'm a professor at several universities here in Germany. As well as working in many other universities across the world. I do a lot of online learning, online teaching. And I have a company in the Netherlands called syntax solutions. And we are educational consultants helping midsize to large companies. Develop learning programs. And we also consult universities as well too. That's wonderful. Wonderful. Thank you. Thank you very much. Which means for about 35 years. Wow. It's a great great experience. Great experience. So by the way, there is a really nice comment if you can see it. And he is an educational rock star. Yes, there is a comment about you. Yes, thank you very much. It's a very good job. And all right. So thank you. Let's move to next question. What was your training point or points in your own education? Well, you know, I've had a long career. I actually studied education. But didn't actually start teaching until later on in my life. Because I moved into the corporate world where I did adult learning and worked for a very large company in London out of New York. And I worked in the personnel department, human resource management, human resource development. So got to see learning and education from the corporate world. And I think that was the debate, you know, my theory that I learned in education was a really good basis for me to start. But I had to do a lot of learning in order to really do my job well. And that job took me all over the world. I was able to work in New York, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Buenos Aires, Virginia, Switzerland, and London, of course. And that was great. So by the time I was 28, I had traveled a lot. You know, for years, a lot about adult education. So that was one of the milestones in my education. But that was pretty early in my career. And then I decided to take a job in Germany for two years as a consultant. And wound up staying here and I've been in Germany now since 1990. Wow, wonderful, great, really. You know, huge experience. It's really wonderful, I'm sure. Okay. So let's move to another question. And would you like that anything else? Well, you know, in the time that I've been here, I've held a lot of different jobs. Pretty much helped many jobs already in the academic world. And I did my PhD here in Germany and of course that led to me coming into the world of academia, which I had never planned. That was not a plan. It was just something that happened that way. And soon after, I opened up my first business here in Germany. And that led to me opening up five different schools. I was also the owner of school throughout Europe. I had two schools in Germany. I had a school in the Netherlands, a school in Spain, and also a school in Greece. Up for our schools in Greece and Spain, we were doing medical English, which was not medical English medical German. We were doing German. We were working in the European Community Project. And my schools in Germany were geared more towards teacher education. And I did that for about 18 years. And it was right before Corona that we decided that we would slowly cut those schools down because what we felt that the market was moving more towards online learning. And that was a very great decision because that decision was made right before Corona. So, you're lucky then. Do we just do the field that we needed office space anymore? Because everything we were doing was online anyway. And I was really, you know, doing a lot of online learning as well. So, it was a great decision. I'm glad we made that decision because then Corona came and we realized that if we would have stayed open, we probably would have gone bankrupt. Yeah, I'm sure you answered and you would have lost of times the school times about it because many had, I think. Yeah, many schools closed because of but for us the decision was the strategic decision. And as I said, I'm glad we made that decision. It was a great decision. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. God, you were the group. We made a great decision. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ron. And you have a huge experience about teaching and learning learning, of course. And I'm sure that during this experience and years, you have tried lots of methodologies and tries strategies and also use them in your lessons or try to transfer these to the other teachers during your training. So, and probably you have a kind of a philosophy. So, what is it? What is your philosophy of teaching? Well, I think when you go to school and study education, you learn a lot of theories. But as a young teacher, you got to get in there and just start doing it because you're not really going to have a highly developed teaching philosophy. It takes a while to develop that because you've got to have some experience, classroom experience. And you've got to be around other teachers as well because being around other teachers helps you to learn what they're doing. You exchange information but coming from the corporate world, learning works in a totally different way for adults. And pretty much constructive approaches to learning is very important for adults. Adults have to have hands-on experience. They need to have tasks and adults understand what task are because that's what they have every day at work. And they know that they have to be responsible to fulfilling those tasks. So, the level of responsibility is already built in to how adults learn in the corporate world. And that really developed, you know, my teaching philosophy as I moved into the academic world. And I have always been a constructiveist, take constructiveist approaches, and for teachers teaching in academic situations at school, whether that be primary school, secondary school, university, a good example of constructiveist approaches would be task-based learning, yes, project-based learning, phenomenon-based learning, all the PBLs. I wrote an article about, get your PBLs right, which I keep posting on my LinkedIn site as well as my Facebook site, because I have a lot of followers on social media. And it's important to know your methodologies, but if you really want to take constructiveist approaches to learning and teaching, you should know the minimum of task-based learning and know the difference between a task and an activity because they're not the same. And know all of your PBLs and you're going in the direction of being constructiveist in your classroom. So, that's really kind of influences my teaching philosophy, because I do believe, less I said in the beginning, that lawyers need to be the creators of content. And through constructiveist approaches, that will definitely happen. I understand, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for the information that to give about your philosophy of teaching. So, if I am not wrong, you are providing kind of a consultancy to the schools or the teachers when they need it. You give them a support if I'm not wrong. So, why do that on social media every day? Yeah, you do that. And how do you, for example, when they ask you teachers or schools, when they ask your support, and how do they help them, and what do they need most? And in every time when you help them, and are you successful about it or sometimes do you fail about it? Can you tell us about it? There are a lot of things that teachers need to know to be effective in the classroom. And technology is one of them. So, the integration of technology into teaching and learning is extremely important. We can just go back to the experience that teachers had worldwide when it comes to when the pandemic started. We could see that many teachers were not prepared for the pandemic because they had no experience with online learning and with technology. And another discovery that teachers, you know, that was one of those rude awakenings and that teaching online is not the same thing as teaching in the classroom. Yeah, right. This requires a totally different kind of pedagogical approach. So, technology is one thing that teachers need to have and knowing the difference between face-to-face learning and online learning and the different pedagogical approaches that they need, which leads to, again, them understanding frameworks. So, T-pack is a framework that I think many teachers need to be familiarized with and knowing that that's really one of the things that I think is very important. If you don't know what T-pack is, you can Google that. I don't think we have a time to get into the details of that. But another thing involved in T-pack, you know, technology is one of them, but pedagogical approaches and content, you know, a lot of people who teach online, who work for language schools, they don't sometimes have an educational background or they don't have a university degree, they didn't study to be a teacher. So, they got to learn all of those things. And yes, I do help private language schools I have before, but they're not my main clients. It's mostly universities. I work with a lot of professors, PhD students, who are, you know, doing their PhDs, they have to learn how to research, they have to speak English, they have to learn a lot of different skills. And the professors that I work with, that's why I have my job at the university that I work at, is I'm involved in an EMI program, which is English as a medium of instruction. I work with specialists, experts who are physicist, scientist, and, you know, I don't math the mathematicians and, you know, very complicated, you know, science taught me. So, I can't really, you know, tell them about their content, but how they deliver that, the pedagogical approaches of that they need to effectively, you know, do that in the classroom instead of lectures, and the different, you know, methodology that they can use online, learning how to use a language management, learning management systems, a technology, like I said, and also English, because they want to improve their English. Now, at the university, I work at we have a language department. I don't work in the language department, and I do not work with any professor who has not reached very high B1 level entry B2 level. They've got to get the basics of language behind them so that we can work together in a one-to-one coaching sessions to help them to improve their English, because they want to deliver their classes in English and help them with methodology as well, too. That's the answer. I see. Thank you. Thank you, Adam, I understand that this is a support that you've given the teachers or the schools. I do work shops at, you know, for teachers, organizations, and travel around the world doing that. Yeah. We're been to over 40 countries all over the world doing workshops and for, at different conferences, different teachers, organizations, and through that's very interesting because it did, you know, it was like a ticket to travel around the world, met a lot of people, I know a lot of people in the EFL world, and that was interesting, but the difference being that when you go to a conference, you know, there's maybe at the big conferences like T-SOUL or I at IELTFL, where there'll be 2,500, maybe 3,000 people, you know, everybody comes with a different learning context, learning environment, or their teaching primaries go to secondary school. So it's very hard to take something, you know, I try to be very general in nature when I'm working with teachers and teachers organizations because of the different contexts that they work in. But when I work for a particular university, like the one I work for here in Germany, and I work for several in Germany, that I understand their context, I understand what their problems are, and I do speak German so we could, you know, solve a lot of problems, but I can't help everybody, you can't help everybody, and while I do have a lot of people who follow me, and loyal followers, I think that they're discerning enough to know the, you know, that what I'm talking about are some things that they can apply in their classroom, and some of the things that won't be able to apply into their classroom, because of the, they're learning teaching context, and also the culture as well too, because of course, a lot of different things don't work in other cultures. Constructive is teaching is one thing that, you know, when you come from a culture where the teacher is the king or the queen and knows everything, and everything is teacher centered, it's very hard to work with students in a constructive his way when they've never been allowed to make decisions for themselves, they've no altitude director of learning, they're always looking for instruction and being told what to do, and then all of a sudden you walk to the room and you let them make decisions for themselves, that's a culture shock for them. So it takes a while for them to accept that kind of teaching and learning. I understand it's really sometimes really hard for them to adopt it. Right, and so far because we're here's an as hard for the students. The board, exactly, thank you very much. Thank you very much Ron. Let's move to another question. I would like to ask, I'm sure that you have, as I mentioned before, that you have a huge experience, and also you have lots of stories. I'm sure that you have a success story too. So is it possible to tell us one or two success stories of yours, something inspirational you know, what would like to share? Well, I think, you know, I'm 65 years old, and I have to say I've been very blessed in my career, but I work very hard. And I'm one of those people who just threw themselves into work, because I like what I do. And I've learned a lot in my journey as being a teacher. So we've had, I think, all of us could tell stories of success, but we probably have more stories of failure than we do with success, because that's the reality of teaching. I think. You know, we learning by doing, but you know, yes, there are a lot of things that I can say I'm very proud of. I'm very proud of the fact that I'm a risk attacker, and just leaving the United States, leaving my friends, leaving my family, leaving my culture, and moving to another country permanently was a big move in my life. But I did it when I was young and I stood a lot of energy. And glad I did that when I was a younger, because it was a great move, a very, very great move. And I'm very proud of that, that I had enough nerve to do it. And I think the other thing that I could say that I'm also very proud of in my career is the fact that I just took the risk of opening up a business and not knowing what was going to come. I had, you know, a lot of ideas of how I would want to do things. And I just gave it. And every day was a learning experience for me. And the first two years were very difficult, but I had a full-time job. So I didn't, you know, always get my whole-time job. And once the school became successful, when we started to grow and started to learn a lot about business and I studied business. I have an MBA in international business administration. And so all of those things I learned were theory, but when you have your own business, you start to see the things from, you know, firsthand. So I learned a lot there. I'm glad I survived that. And I could probably write a book about that. So owning a business in education is fun. But I was glad when I closed my schools. And I'm glad now for the, where I'm at now in my life. My life is a little bit easier, not so stressful. And I can enjoy all the things that I've worked for in my life, like my garden. I understand. Thank you. Thank you very much, Aron. And I would like to ask you that another question, something related with the education, and as we all know that the artificial intelligence is getting really bigger and bigger and takes, you know, the huge part in our, you know, the daily life, especially the social media. And also, I think it's, it's moving to every part of every part of the, the, the job. And also, it's also in the education. And what do you think? What do you think about AI and the language education? What's going to happen with it? Well, those are several questions. Okay, but let me just start by saying that everybody seems to, you know, have their all in an uproar about AI, but AI is not new. It's been around for a long time. Yes. If you Google, that's AI. And so we've been using AI and AI is integrated into everything that we do. Now, I have been using AI for many different reasons. Work time, many different projects. Teacher training is not new for me. I've been doing that for, you know, closer 30 years. And one of the things I had biggest problems I had there in teacher training was teaching teachers how to use technology in the classroom. And, you know, without even thinking that it was really AI as well too. But AI as we know it today, a lot of people relate that to chat GPT. And I think we've, you know, it's just just exploded in the last year that we have gotten past chat GPT because there are many different chat boxes that we can go to. So there's different, we have different alternatives now. For AI, we don't just need chat GPT. We can use many others. And I think that teachers do need to get on board. Just like they needed to get on board with technology integration into the classroom, that they needed to get on board with online learning and, you know, situations developed that we realize that we get need those skills. And I believe that in about the next two to five years, closer more to two years than five, that if a teacher doesn't know how to integrate artificial intelligence into how they plan, how they put lessons together, that they might not be able to get a good job. They'll probably be able to get a lower-paying job, but I think companies in the corporate world really need instructors, trainers, and some teachers who really are up to date with their AI skills. So it's not a game, it's again, not a warning, not something to instilled fear into teachers, because there's nothing to be afraid of. It's just another skill that you have to add to your skills, skillset, to, you know, be an effective teacher. So they should be getting on board. And any of the teachers here today follow me on social media, they'll see that I always post a lot of information about AI and different sites to go to, to learn more about it. And of course, I'll be doing a series of webinars about AI and lesson planning and instructional design, and how all those things really fit together. I'll be doing actually a workshop this coming weekend for the German Association of Community Colleges. They're having there and all that. And so yeah, I think it's just a skill that you just have to add to all the other skills that we need to effectively teach in the classroom. I understand, thank you, thank you very much, Rome. So I wanted to ask you another question, it's not something about AI, but differently, it's kind of the, to term instructional design. So this is really, I should I know either about it. So what is it? What is the instructional design and what is the role of in education? Well, as I said earlier, I came from a corporate background, and in the corporate world of learning and adult learning, we use the term instructional design. That is not new. It's not a new term. When you're a trainer and you're working with adults in a corporate learning environment, you do need to know how to put a course or a workshop together. And that means that you're going to, you've got to have some skills that you bring to the table, and you've got to be very organized. You have to know how to organize a workshop or some a course at a company. And that means that you have to know how to do needs analysis. And you've got to know what knowledge and skills those people at that company need. And you've got to develop skills. Are you got to develop tasks and projects around those so that they can learn because adults need on hand learning and they need task in order to learn something. And they don't have a lot of time. And you also have to know what skills and competencies they as participants need to bring to the table to learn effectively, as well as getting a sense of learning successfully. So this is important. And this is what instructional designers do. They know that. And they also know that the learners are there to fulfill a need. A gap that they have that they need this to go further in their career. So it's very connected to their work. And they understand how people learn adults. And we sometimes as teachers use terms interchangeably that is actually wrong like pedagogy. And we don't realize it. pedagogy really is about how young people learn primary school, secondary school, maybe even university. But people and companies and adults, we use, you know, that's Andrew Gaudy. And that's different principle of the ideas of teaching and learning. So how we teach adults might not work for how we need to teach young people. This is why I never talk about young learners primary school because I don't know anything about that. But I do know about secondary school, you know, about I do know. And that's very different because what happens in a primary school is different than what happens in a secondary school. And what happens in a university is also different. But instructional design is it's, I don't want to say it's a science. It's just a, but you can get a degree in it. You can go to school and learn it. But I don't think you really have to these days. There's so many great things on LinkedIn and social media, Google. There's online courses that you can take. I think it's better if you specialize in something. And whatever that you want to, you know, do an instructional design course in. Because, you know, before you collect, and you still can study at that university. Again, you don't have to. But I did. I did study that I wanted to learn more about that. And I did that in my mid 20s because this kid was part of my job. Now, teachers working in state schools and language schools, private language schools, they probably know a little bit about instructional design because they're doing less in planning. But so less in planning is the beginning of instructional design. But now with AI, you need to know what instructional design is because you need to be able to put together a 360 degree lesson plan. And that's different than just these lesson plans that you can find online, which are cookie cut and you just, you know, you're going to have to tailor them to your need and change them. But, and again, this is something that I haven't really talked too much about. But I will be talking about that in the next couple of months. This, what is the 360 degree lesson plan? Because instructional designers know what that is. They have to know what that is. So again, instruction design is a skill. It's a job. And it's a job like for adult learners. But you can use it for primary school and secondary school university. I understand. It's mostly about the corporate world. But teachers need to start learning how do they teach and learn in the corporate world. Because this is what we're preparing our learners for, especially at university, is to enter the corporate world. And of course, that leads us to another topic of the future learning, future proofing, many ideas that come with where are our students going to be in five years when they leave our classes, you know, at the university. I'm very much into future proofing and integrating that into what I do in the classroom with my business students. Because I do teach business students as well. And I want to make sure that they're learning the skills that they need to survive and to work effectively and have success in their careers. And I take a very instructional design approach when I put those classes together. I see. Thank you. Thank you very much for the information that you provide us here about instructional design. Thank you very much. And also, if I'm not wrong, we can find more information in your LinkedIn page. I think about instructional design. Am I right? Well, you could go to, you know, I'm not going to say that I'm a specialist in that, but I know what it is. But if you really want to go and learn more about that, go to YouTube and Google instructional design. And you're probably going to come up with the name Devlin Peck. And he has some of the best videos on learning about what instructional design is and all the different steps of that. And if you take the time, if you're a self-directed, self-regulated learner and that's who I cater to on social media, is that you will listen to those videos and learn so much. They'll answer all your questions. Devlin Peck on YouTube is the best teacher for instructional design. And they're free. You got it wonderful. So the after-decessions are definitely going check because I really wonder what do you think you're much for the information about it? And you just mentioned a term like I was going to ask you, but you mentioned it's self-directed learning, you said. And this also another very important term. So can you tell us about it? What is that? What is self-directed learning? And yes. Well, let me give you a little sort of maybe an analogy. And that is that when a teacher walks into the room and no matter, you know, they're going to be teacher-centered or student-centered. But it should be the goal of a teacher to make sure that their learners have a little bit of voice and choice in what takes place in the classroom. So, you know, self-directed learning is we might not see it, but there are a lot, you know, not everybody learns the same. And there are some people who are highly motivated. And they don't need people to tell them what to do. They just know that intuitively. They're just instinctive with that. And we can see that as teachers and state schools and maybe even language schools that people who are self-motivated and always do the homework, always do the task. They're always there. They're just motivated. We don't have to motivate them. But you know, self-directed person empowers themselves. They want to learn. They like learning and they have their own strategies of learning and they make decisions for themselves. They create activities and tasks for themselves to learn. And they go out on into Google, on the internet. And they find resources for themselves to learn. And they like to learn in groups a lot of times. Some self-directed learners learn by themselves. But for them, it's important to learning groups. So, they'll form little study groups or something. And we see that as well at schools. And they're very effective in their learning strategies. They know what works for them. They know what doesn't work. They know what they like. They know what they don't like. And they are very critical sometimes about what they're learning and how they're learning. And they're usually the first ones to give you feedback in the classroom. Because they know what they want. And it's great to have learners like that. But not everyone is that way. And maybe from what I just said, you might think that a self-directed learner is an extravert. But not always so. A lot of times they're introverts. A lot of people think that I'm some kind of big whatever extravert in life speaking, whatever. But I'm actually a very quiet person in my private life. And it takes a lot of energy and nerve for me to get up and speak in front of people even though I've done it so many times. But I'm a self-directed learner. I've always been. I've always made decisions for myself and found ways for myself. And I always find other people like me who like learning, who are self-motivated, we don't have to motivate ourselves. And you know, when you're a self-direct and I think teachers dream of having a classroom filled with self-directed learners. But if you really have, if you're lucky enough, and I have in my life, in my career, to have a lot of self-directed learners, I turn those learners into my assistance in the classroom because they want extra task. They want something else to do because they already know what's happening. They're really in touch with everything. They have a very high sense of reality. And again, they know what they want. And they're always the one who step forward and ask if you need any help or anything. And I always take advantage of that because we're going to have different kinds of learners in our classroom. And you definitely want to seek out the self-directed learners. And don't think that they're the extraverts because sometimes the extraverts are not always the self-directed learners. But it's kind of the great things to have a self-directed learners in your classrooms. You became also, if anything, about the teacher's site, also teachers become motivated. I think if I'm not wrong, we also become more motivated to see this have directed learners in your classroom. I think we want to believe that maybe it's something we do in the classroom that leads them to self-directed learning. And I think to a certain extent, we can have an influence on that in the classroom because maybe if we're just more student-centered, really clear about our task and the projects that we give students and the responsibilities that we give them that they begin to understand how learning works. And then they want to be part of their learning process. So this is important for me and I try to do that and I can't say that I have success all the time because we never really know what motivates or demotivates a person no matter what they tell us. Because we don't know what's going on in their private life. And when you're working with the adults, adults don't usually talk about all those things, especially in the corporate world. But students, there is a social aspect of learning where they do share private things with one another. And this is why collaborative learning is extremely important to keep students motivated. And hopefully if you know who you're highly motivated self-directed learners are, and you make sure that you separate them correctly in groups when you're doing collaborative learning, you can make self-directed learning contagious actually, if you know how to work with that. But it takes a while I think to understand how that works. And again, it's not something you're going to just learn one day after leaving university. You got to get into the classroom and just start learning what really learning is about and the dynamics of learning. But definitely self-directed learning is one of those phenomena that happens in learning. Something that we all wish for because in the end, I think it's important that we see that our learners are doing things by themselves. They're making good decisions for themselves. And we just have to be just on the side guiding the and managing the process of learning. And when you get to that point, when you know your classroom can manage itself, then you've got a group of self-directed learners. Thank you. Thank you, Ron, for giving a lot of information about self-directed learning to us. Thank you very much. And I would like to move to another question. So I know that you have, you know, you've been giving lots of presentations or training sessions in your career so far. So when you think about them sessions or presentation, physically face to face, what was over the most interesting situation or situations that you faced? Well, this interesting doesn't always mean something positive. But maybe I just said that interesting, but if you want to say something vice versa, another problem. Because, you know, I can say something on both sides there. I think it's interesting that a lot of teachers, you know, I have a face book side called webinars for English teachers, which we have about 35,000 teachers there all over the world, who come there and I always post free webinars that are taking place and whatever. Now, during Corona, that was really important because a lot of teachers got to get a lot of information that they really needed to, you know, to help them get through Corona. And I met a lot of great people from that site, all over the world. And I have to say that one of the things that really is something I noticed that maybe I didn't like was that teacher signed up for a webinar and they don't even know how Zoom works. They don't know how to work Microsoft. They don't know how to work Word. They don't know how to work Google. And they don't realize that if you're going to be doing online learning, especially you as a teacher, you have to have those skills. You have to bring those skills to the table and you don't have to be a master at them, but you should know the basics. And if you don't, well, then that's going to be bad for the person doing the webinar because, you know, they want to do something about maybe AI and you don't know how to work Google and get to the document and log on and don't even have a Google address or whatever. This makes it so complicated and frustrating. And, you know, I'm going to be quite honest with you. I just throw those people out now because I can't deal with it anymore. I just get impatient with it. And on the good side, there's so many teachers out there that this is the one thing that makes me feel that I really do feel I'm filling a niche in the market. You know, I feel very uncomfortable asking for money and making people pay for things. But, and I know that everybody, you know, there's parts of Africa, North Africa, the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia, South America, Central America, and the other teachers that follow me come from these countries, and these geographical areas of the world. And, you know, they don't have money to pay for all these expensive webinars. And I believe that if you're a teacher and you really like your job, you see it as a career for yourself that you're going to take the opportunity that's offered to you from some of the websites that I run. And I make sure that I really run a clean ship. I don't let a lot of spam on there. I check what's, you know, really on those sides. You will see that even on my social media sites mean personally. I don't put private things there, politics, pictures of, you know, memes that are crazy or whatever, of cats and squirrels and dogs or whatever. You know, it's just really focused about education and pedagogical things, a technology, AI. And free webinars where you can learn, because I do believe that if you want to be an effective teacher in the classroom, money is not a barrier. There are so many things out there that are for free. Take advantage of those things. Uh, and I know I have me. And I just want to make sure that teachers know that that you don't need to have a lot of money to learn and to get better and be a better teacher in the classroom and to learn how to improve your team back. And even your content knowledge, I think teachers so we're teaching, you know, grammar syllabus oriented classes. Well, they definitely are going to have a problem because this morning, I googled English online grammar and got, I think, 250 million results. Wow. Why would somebody teach you to teach them grammar when they can get it for free on Google on the internet? And I'll go to YouTube. Now, I know there's a lot of influencers out there who are making money from that. But usually they're making money, not because they're selling the class. It's because they have some great grammar lessons that are free and they just make money from the advertising. But they're not trying to exaggerate. You are right, a totally agree. And wrong, there's a question from the followers. Can I ask it? Sure. I will divert into the screen. Brack is asking, how do you blend culture and realize context into language teaching? Well, I'm going to have to turn that question around in is how do you not deal with culture and you're doing language teaching? Because language is about culture. And if you're teaching English, this becomes more difficult because it doesn't make a difference if you're doing Arabic or Spanish or German. You know, German is not only spoken in Germany. German is the most widely spoken language in Europe. On the continent. English is, so there is German as language forunk, there's English as language forunk Spanish. Look how many countries Spanish is spoken in. There's so many. And if you look at Spanish, I'd like to start with Spanish. Not everyone who speaks Spanish, shares the same culture. Not everyone who speaks Arabic shares the same culture. Not everyone who speaks English shares the same culture. So you do need to understand, you know, cultural aspects of language. And learning about learning a new language is definitely going to open your eyes to how other cultures work, how people see themselves. So you can't separate the two. You can't try to do that. But I think it makes for a very dry learning experience because culture is a very integral part of language learning. And teachers make that decision for themselves whether they're going to teach British English. And I always think that that's sort of strange because if you're going to teach British English, have you lived in a country? What do you know about the culture? Is it just theoretical? Do you know, if you're like me, I'm an American. I think I'm always shocked if how many people have these ideas of the United States, but it's all from Hollywood movies. It's not reality when they start to realize what it is. They're sort of shocked in a lot of ways. You know, I've traveled throughout the, you know, North Africa in the Middle East. And I know that there's a big difference between, you know, Morocco and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, these are different cultures. And a lot of them in under their different dialects of Arabic. So you've got to know about culture. And you should always teach about culture and not just the differences that we have, but the similarities that we have as well to. I think that's important. I know. I did. Thank you. Thank you very much for the answer. Let's move to another another question for one. So, Ron, how do you see yourself in 10 years? Will you still be doing this job or are you going to throw in other jobs? Well, I just noticed that there's somebody there in her name is Grace. I noticed that we came to something. And Grace lives in Mexico. She's from Argentina. And you know, I lived in work in Mexico. And I have a home in the United States. I have a home in Spain. I have a home in Germany as well. So I hope that if everything goes to plan, I will definitely just enjoy my retirement and travel to my different homes. And definitely make sure that I get a house as well. A little apartment in Mexico. Because I like traveling. It's just part of what I like to do. And I'm going to probably retire in a few years. But I don't think I'm going to quit teaching. I think that's somebody's blood after a while. So I like that. But I know I'll probably do you know webinars still. But Germany's cold. And I don't like the winters here. That's what I like our house in Spain. And it's getting our my house in the United States in Texas. It's very hot there. So I don't think I'm going to retire there. But definitely what travel. So I think maybe even in five years, I'm just going to enjoy my retirement. Wonderful. Wonderful. There's also another comment there from Anthony. I say, Antonio. I know Antonio is a friend. Mm. He also says really thank you. He says thank you to you. And for the things that you have taught him. It's a really wonderful to see this comments here. And let me ask you another question, room. It's like, you know, sometimes people who'd like to have in some difficult situations, all Irish, I could have that superpower and to deal with this problem with people's sadists. So when you think about yourself, if you could have one superpower to use in the class, Victor, as a teacher, what would it be and how would it help you? Well, I think I wish I could have a superpower of mind reading. Well, that I could really read the minds of my learners and understand them. Not because I want to know everything about them, but definitely we'll like to know, what's in their minds? What did they want? Because our learners don't always express what they really want. And all the years that I've had in experience in the classroom, what they say to you, might not actually be what they really want. And I think if you had the superpower of mind reading, that you're able, you don't need to do what needs analysis. I think you should start going with what they want. Yeah, what they need. The learners don't always know what they need. They'll tell you what they want. But what they want is not always what they need. And also just getting into the minds of people to understand how what really is important to get motivated into the learning process. I think it's a lot easier with adults. I think anyone who's a primary school teacher, I don't think that we as other teachers recognize the very difficult job that they have. Because they're doing more than just teaching. They're socializing young people. Their job is totally different than what we do in secondary school and at the university or the corporate world. So it's important to, like I said, you know, we're talking about superpowers here. I definitely would like to be able to give you a reminder of my own. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much for your superpower to tell us. Okay. And by the way, just two questions left. You know, the time flies from this really, really, you know, the wonderful moments we are having here. Thanks to you. And let me ask you the first question before the last one. Let's finish this interview and you step outside the home and find a lot of ticket and up with the $10 million what would you do? Well, first of all, Chen Nili is not very much money. I think money is really good. It was not a long money. Okay. But I probably would give half a bit away. But just don't need that much money. You just, I already planted my trees and already have my car and have my house. And so I mean, I thought it's not as if I need to buy a new furniture or anything, nothing like that. I mean, oh, I probably would get a personal trainer and I'm nutritionist and a cook to cook for me in my retirement. But I know probably I would probably give half of it away. And I sort of know where I would give it away, too. But it would all be to people who, one thing I learned during Corona is I didn't realize, you know, everybody thinks Germany's a very rich country. And it is. It's the economic powerhouse of Europe. But there are still a lot of people here in Germany who don't have access to the internet, who don't have a laptop, who don't have an iPhone. Here we are talking on an iPhone. I'm talking to you, you know, for my iPhone. But Corona made me open my eyes to that and I worked on a project to make sure that we could get as many laptops to as many teenagers as possible to make sure they had the same chances to learn as everybody else. And that was really an eye-opening experience for me. So I think that we should not forget that no matter where we live at, there's going to be people who need to have access to the internet, need the equipment, and we need to do what we can to help them. And not in the sense that I pity them, but because I want to give to people what was given to me, I like to get back what was given to me. I've met a lot of great people in my life who've been great mentors, great teachers, and they gave a lot to me. And when I'm in the classroom, I try to remember them. And I just know that one of my mentors, I don't think she ever let me pay for lunch. She always paid out of her own money. So sort it, it would be like giving back. So if I'm on the 10 million, yes, I would probably give after that. Oh, I got it. Okay, thank you. And here is the last question, and I think the the real difficult one. And what is your motto? Well, if you follow me on social media, you probably should already know the answer to that question. But I keep it on you, Lansing. And you know, I believe that when you are grown up and act like a grown-up, okay, that you've got to be critical about things. You've got to, you know, scrutinize things. You've got to break things down and ask questions and not just accept everything that's thrown at you. And if you kind of make decisions for your own self-development and personal growth. And this is why I have on my LinkedIn side learning for the discernment. Because we need to be more discerning about what we learn and what we need to learn and make good decisions in that way. And that's my motto is learning for the discerning. I've made some mistakes in decisions that I've made for myself about learning. But I think I've made more good decisions than bad decisions. I think the bad decisions were just based on I made them in the last minute. Do really think about it. And the ones that I really think about, I do it. I do it. I got it. So I consider myself a discerning person. And I think we as teachers need to be discerning about our learning. That's my motto. Learning for that, sir. This learning. I see. Thank you. Thank you very much, Ron. Thank you very much. Okay, so that's all my question, Ron. And before ending our last sessions, would you like to add anything else? Well, I have to thank you for inviting me. And I don't know how many people are here. But definitely it was an actually a lot of the names that I know. And so if I load to all of you and for those who don't know me, follow me on social media. There's a lot of great things out there. Webinars for English teachers on Facebook, on my personal side from Ron Mirai, I post things daily about teaching, technology, go to goga goga things, identical things. It's all free. And I'm not trying to sell you anything. It's just there because I like to share with my colleagues. And I also share those things on LinkedIn. So you can follow me on LinkedIn too. And thank you. Well, come for letting me have this opportunity to promote that, not myself, but to sidestens themselves. Because I think teachers can benefit from those. Definitely. And before ending, I would like to say one more time. Thank you very much. And for being with us tonight, Ron, that was really wonderful. And thank you very much for your suggestions for advice. And especially the most important thing is your time. You spend your time here with us. That was marvelous and very meaningful for us. Thank you very much. And Ron Ron Mirai, was with us tonight.
