 Welcome everybody to this panel on Lorewen and education. So I'm joined by Remco, Al and Mark. Should we start with some introductions maybe? Yeah. Mark, why don't you go ahead? Sure. Hi, I'm Mark Stanley. I run a small business called Fingertude in the UK. And I guess my involvement with education is being around teaching Lorewen and the principles of IoT to primary school, secondary school, and university. Is that enough of an introduction? I'm Al from Sensational Systems. We are primarily distributors of IoT hardware and devices, and a lot of Lorewen. We're based in Edinburgh, in the UK, and also now in the Netherlands. And we work quite closely with the University of Edinburgh, and they have many projects in education. So that's been an interesting world to get into. All right. I'm Remco. I'm the chairman of IoT Aplodoren. That is the association that came out of the TT and Aplodoren community. And I'm teaching still at the University of Applied Sciences, where I'm working with a program of embedded systems engineering. And I've got 30 years of experience in telecommunication. Sounds good. Welcome, everybody. I'm Ben Oleyenka, and I do technical content for the things industries. So that means a lot of writing about how to use Lorewen products and then also trying to create awareness about Lorewen as a solution. So the first question is, how do you see Lorewen being used in education? Mark? So my involvement has been really so most of my customers are local government in the UK. And they are keen to engage with local communities, particularly around things like Lorewen. And in the UK, the teaching of technology is probably not as it should be in the schools. So they often look for outside support. So in South Wales, I have been working with Comarthenshire Council doing a really fun two-session run-through of IoT with nine-year-olds. So this is originally teaching them about sensors and radio and then deploying a load of sensors in the school and then coming back six weeks later and doing a session all on the data that we have gathered from that and talking about things like data security and stuff like that. I've been doing workshops with secondary education in a technical college. And I hire students as well. So 17, 18-year-old students, I will hire them for projects over the summer so they get some real work experience. And then I guess the third bit would be working with universities. So we developed a personal safety solution for Reading University, developed with students at the university that has since been taken on and it's now a safety application for the whole town of Reading. So anyone who lives there can make use of that. Yeah, I think that should cover it. So I've been working with the University of Edinburgh quite a lot. They had some funding. So they have a reasonable amount of money to spend in IoT devices and solutions. And it's got to be focused in our area of the country, which is the southeast of Scotland. So this money is to be spent in benefiting the people and the environment and all these kind of things. So one of the things they really wanted to focus on is education, more about data than about the technology itself. So they see that there's a real gap in education in the UK, especially when it comes to data. And the next generation is going to have to be able to analyze data and understand it better and more automatically. And really, that's just not being taught very well. So their project is to put CO2 sensors, LOROAM CO2 sensors, and gateways into every school in the region, which is 550 schools. We've deployed about half now. And they've built an educational program around those that they are delivering through the teachers. So they're educating the educators how to teach these kids about data science. And the kids in schools have now got real world data to look at. So they move the sensors around, and they see what happens. They leave them in their rooms, and they see the levels go up. They open the windows. They see them come down. So in this case, the LOROAM is an interesting component of it, but it's not the key thing. It is more about the data and understanding what it means and getting the reasons and the understanding there. So that's the key thing there. And our part of this project has been helping with the delivery of it. So obviously, there's a lot of gateways to get out. There's a lot of sensors to get out and configuring all this stuff and getting all delivered to all these different schools and dealing with all these different educational authorities. So it's a big logistical thing. But we went into one of the schools, and it was really fun. Like, they had some kids that were last year at primary school, which I think is, well, 10, 11, that sort of age. And they had, you know, there was these four girls that had been first to really test this stuff out. And they were so keen and so interested. And they were like, this is really cool. And then we brought in some other sensors for them to look at. And they're like, all right, what does this one do? What does this one do? What does this one do? And they just wanted to know everything. They were just soaking it up. So that was really cool. So they're now looking at expanding this project and seeing what else they can put out. Like, weather stations. And, you know, so they can detect rainfall and particulates in the air and all that. And they can find out more about their environment. So it's been really interesting. Yeah, well, I'm using Lora One in my program in my classes. And for me in the classes, Lora One is a vehicle. I mean, Lora One, as we all know, is not fit for all purposes. As for every purpose, there's a different protocol or whatever that you need to apply. And Lora One is a vehicle for me to teach my students in seven weeks the magic that comes with designing IoT devices, defining IoT solutions in there. Because engineering an IoT solution is a five-dimensional chess, play a chess that you've got. On one hand, you've got power, low power budget, from the battery, low power, you've got coverage, you've got data rate, you've got latency, you've got whatever the data comes through, yes or no. All kind of things that if you design an IoT solution, and that's what I'm teaching my students, Lora One is capable of offering you that. And the fun thing about Lora One is that, I mean, it's a modern standard, it's a relative recent standard, although 2016, 2017, there's still a reason. It's secure by design, it's with low power in mind. And what's very nice about Lora One standard in my course is that it's a standard, it's only this thick. You can read it in an evening, not necessarily. It's not a fun evening, is it? Well, you sleep very well afterwards. But you can read it in an evening and then you don't understand everything, but you can start with it. If you go for a modern standard like narrowband or LT-Cadema or whatever, I don't know whether the stack of paper fits here from the floor up to the ceiling, and I can deal with that in seven weeks. So Lora One is for me a vehicle that I use to have use cases, they come with a use case, and they have to implement it. And they have to think also about it, whether Lora One is the right technology of choice. And of course I've decided to use Lora One, you get an indoor gateway from me, you get a nice device to prototype on, but you may challenge me in my class and say, okay, you've chosen Lora One, you should have chosen narrowband. And then I say, good idea. Why? Come up with a reasoning. And therefore Lora One for me is a vehicle to be able to teach my students and make them the new engineers that will contribute to all the sensors and all the networks that we're going to deploy and applications with, for example, what we see here on this fair. It is an amazing, like the end-to-end bit of Lora One, you can just about get your whole arms around, and you can develop a device, an end device on a sensor, you can get it configured to a network server, you can understand the radio side of things, you can get the data out of the other end and onto the internet. And there aren't many strands of technology where you can actually understand the whole end-to-end piece relatively quickly, you know, so as a student, it's something you can pick up and really feel like you've got a good grip on it. Every piece that is in the chain from the node, from the sensor up to the presentation in there, you'll find it everywhere in every other technology in every use case again. Maybe a bit differently implemented, but the foundation is the same everywhere. It's just a chain and that's the nice thing about Lora One. And you can run it all yourself, you can do every part yourself, you're not reliant on an operator. And it's what also is very nice is, and that's also very important in modern education, depending on the need, the interest of the student, you can divert within the range of Lora One, okay, he's more interested in low power, then you dig into low power. Oh, he's like, want to know about the back end, oh, here's TTS, here's Chirpsack, what's that? You've got a server implemented, do it yourself, and come up with the results. And then all these individual initiatives, they're all brought together into the same project, which works in the end. Yeah. That sounds like a really interesting variety of examples there. Yeah. Do you actually get your students to read the Lora One standard? Yeah. And what fun is, I mean, I start with a presentation on Lora One, and then there are a couple of videos, which unfortunately are V2 videos, then I always have to translate, yeah, okay, you prefer that one, but nevertheless, and then after three weeks, they all get a challenge. Do things foundation training and the exam on here, and 75% of them really take the exam and get the badge. And that's also quite interesting, because then they have also the element of competition in there. So yes, they go in there, and I have weekly, I have questions, I challenge them, and I come up with, I confront them in their engineering decisions with, okay, the standard says this, how do you address that? And then we've got a very interesting discussion with you guys. I wrote some of those questions, and I haven't read the Lora One standard in its entirety, I don't think that. Yeah. You've got some homework now then. Yeah, yeah, well that's tonight. I mean, if you have trouble sleeping, read the whole thing. On the train maybe. Sure is a disadvantage about the Lora One standards. I mean, you can still sleep in it when you put it on your pillow, and it's heavy on your head when you start sleeping. Okay, good. I think that you guys touched on this a little bit, but why do you think it's important to use Lora One, or maybe even other types of IoT in education? One thing that you said made me immediately think about the gender gap in STEM. You mentioned that you have a group of girls who are really excited about the census. Yeah. Yeah, so maybe we can collaborate. That was a funny one. So this was one of the first schools that they deployed this in as a test case. So we went over to see them and kind of chat about it, and I did a little talk about my bit of the world and stuff. But apparently they kind of asked the class to put their hands up if they were interested in joining and doing this stuff first. And it was these four girls that just went, they went straight into it. And they just really ran with it. So now, and what was really interesting is these girls who are like 10 or 11 are now dragging in all of their classmates and like, this is cool. And then everybody else is looking over their shoulders and going, oh yeah, they didn't. That's great, that's interesting. That's better than just stuff on a whiteboard. So that really works. So they've like added, they've become cheerleaders for the whole thing and like getting people involved. And so that's really really good. But rolling it out across all the schools, obviously you've got a nominal 50-50 mix of genders and schools. So right, you've got all those kids there, you've got a captive audience to talk to. So every kid of that age in our region of Scotland is going to be learning about this stuff. So it's not that, it's not going to be a divided thing. You're all going to get a look at it, or get a chance to play with it, and that's how it should be. So hopefully, as a father of a daughter, I'm kind of hoping that this gender gap will close and we'll see how it goes. But I think this is a really good start. Yeah. I think what's very important is about Loroana is that it is so accessible. And with that, you have more youngsters, kids coming in, being able to start with it. And they have very rapidly, they have the experience of success. And when the experience of success is there, then the fun comes in and all these things facilitate in the learning. And I think Loroana as a protocol, if you see it as not as a means, but as something that you can use in what you want to obtain, then that is very much supportive on that one. I suppose that you're saying that, obviously, you can do that, the whole piece. Like you can do the whole thing from end to end. But you can also quite easily skip large sections of it. So you can hide the difficult bits and say, OK, so here's your sensor. Let's not worry about the network server bit. That just works, let's say, on some dashboards. So you can start with a nice overview and work down. When I did an engineering degree, my lecturer called it a process of diminishing deception. Yeah. Then first year, everything's cool, everything's easy. Look at this shiny stuff. And then in next year, it's like, remember I said that was easy. Well, actually, peel back a layer. And then by the end of the time, you wanted to kill yourself because you're now down at the atoms. Yeah, you simply level up. Yeah, yeah. But it's a way you can start at the top and work your way down kind of nicely, can't you? Yeah. Yeah, I hired Tracy, who had just finished her A-levels. She hadn't done as well as she wanted. So she was going to resit them so that she could go to university. So she came to work for me for a year. She came up with the idea for the Personal Safety app. And we pitched that to the council together. And she got £100,000 worth of funding, which as someone who is, right, she's 19 at the time, that's a real sort of endorsement for your idea. And that's just through learning a bit about Laura Wan and what potential it had. And then going on to actually deliver it was, it's been a real growth for her. She went back, absolutely aced the A-level. She's done a degree, a master, she's doing a PhD now, still involved in technology, which, as you said at the beginning, the gender gap is a real problem. And this is one way or one example of someone who's beaten that and really doing well in it. So... That's a really inspiring story. I think with Laura Wan and IoT, you're able to plant a seed in these youngsters where they are sensible or sensitive to technology. And this piece of interest is growing in there. And at some moment, it can take short or long time, it blossoms, and then they are capable of doing some really nice things, much nicer things than we have done so far with IoT, with Laura Wan, for example. Yeah. What would you say is unique about using Laura Wan in education? The diversity. I think for us, it's the variety of things you can do with it. The different applications, different sensors. So many different sensors that we're not teaching the protocol, but we're teaching how to use these things. And it's like, okay, so you can get weather stations, pest control, you can have the environmental things being monitored, you can do soil sensors, all sorts of stuff. And I guess we do quite a lot in higher-level education as well and research. So when you go up the stack, you've got a lot of research going on and there's people here doing all these kind of things, research projects, and they want a sensor for this and a sensor for that. And like, well, Laura Wan does all of this stuff now, so you can always find the right devices for them. And then that enables their research to happen that much more easily. So the variety of use cases allows you to make them wonder. Mm. I mean, they come up with a sensor with an ultrasound height meter and then they go, okay, what do I use this for? And then you come up within the context of global warming or, for example, the flood network, which is in the UK. Yep. Where you have there an actual purpose of flooding and then you translate it to what happened in Rue Mont a couple of years ago in the Netherlands and you look at what's happening currently in Eastern Europe with the raining, then you get context to it and that's all possible with the use of Laura Wan and the variety, the diversity of that one. And so it works the other way around as well where they can come to you and say, we want to measure this. Yeah. And you go, oh, yeah, I have a thing for that. And not necessarily the thing you thought of, but we know how to do that. So we can always find something. Yeah, true. I mean, we had a reverse due cash project in there where they had to do all kinds of things and there was one guy that came up, yeah, I wanted to do some communication with the box. Well, okay. Consider Laura Wan. And there are some limitations, which you ran in rapidly into and you had to address it. So we have very much a learning experience on that one. Yeah, that's all possible. I think there's something great if you've got Laura Wan in a town as well, because you can take the stuff outside of the school system. I mean, Marco's project with the junior IoT challenges is absolutely fantastic. And if you haven't seen it, it's well worth going to talk to. But this idea that you can start with something in school and you can think about how you might apply it to your own home or your garden or like kids love the idea of being able to see where their pet cat is gone in the garden. And that's something you can actually realize. They can do that. And I think that means that they're thinking about it more than just in the lesson time. Al, you also mentioned that you can conceal complicated parts of the system and then later make them simple. And I think Laura Wan is interesting in that you can you can run a gateway and explain how to set that up and what it does. And then you can go outside and use a gateway that's managed by somebody else. So you have both of these aspects where you're plugging into a system that is bigger than you, but then also you're able to relatively quickly set that up and understand it. Yeah, and there's so many resources online as well for learning. So, you know, kids are brilliant at finding the how-to videos. Just better research is on the web than we are. Yeah, yeah. But we also like the TTI videos. Like you make some nice videos that, you know, make things easy and understandable. But we like Johann's video, which is like, was it Laura Wan in an hour or 30 minutes or something crazy? Basically, it goes from end to end. And whenever we've got a new person that we're saying, right, here's a video, covers everything. It's hard work, right? Sit down, have a cup of coffee. Yeah. And it starts out really easy. It's like, so you've got gateways and devices. And it's like, bang, spreading factors, bang, ADR. Like it gets all the detail. But you can, yeah, the whole thing can be done in an hour. And you sit and concentrate. You can like, yeah, you pick up an awful lot. So when we have new people starting, like saying, you know, we can, we can onboard them quite quickly into the Laura Wan world with a few of these videos and get them going. And they understand a whole lot of it. Yeah. I remember watching that the first time and not really understanding anything. Yeah, you have to watch a few times. You have to watch a few times and then use stuff. It tests. You know, so like each time, yeah. Yeah. And just it's like the hands-on aspect that then makes those things that are actually already in your brain like sit, I think. Yeah. Where do you see the future of Laura Wan in education or in IoT in education and STEM in education? Well, I see the future in as much as Birmingham City University, Dr. Adela Neba. He was here in, I think, 2017, 2018 and then started teaching Laura Wan in his bachelor degree with students back then. I'm now working with people who've been through that program now at research level, still at the university, putting projects together that actually involve sort of using Laura Wan to do other research. And I think that's really exciting. And I guess at the much younger end, in Wales again, I was, one of the schools was in a town and the kids there had done this a couple of weeks earlier. They'd been running businesses, like virtual businesses at school. And they were really interested in how you could apply Laura, like when we'd been through the workshops I was doing with them, how you could apply that to their business and manage, they were talking about, you know, football going in and out the shops, could you tell this? And this is a nine-year-old kid and I think that's brilliant. And then I was at another school, which is much more rural. So all the kids come from farming backgrounds and their ability to decrypt encoded messages. So I would write something up in encoded on the board. And by the time I'd finished writing, they would be there going, I know what that is. And I think it's very exciting. You know, if we can get these skills into people young enough and the interest and enthusiasm that comes with it, then hopefully that carries through. Yeah, I think for me the scale now, now that we are seeing much bigger roll-out of stuff, so we're finally with the Seton Reunion Project, we're rolling out to all of the schools. It's taken a long time to get all the councils and education authorities to actually agree to get these devices into their schools, which we now have much more agreement, so this project is going faster, getting them out there. So we'll be covering thousands and thousands of kids, which is really great. But also you've got now much bigger deployments of sensors like environmental sensors, which means you've got much more data to work with. So now there's a whole other bunch of research and another education avenues that open up, just based on the data that's being captured at much bigger scale. And I think that's really interesting from teaching kids about data and how to use that. That's really interesting. When we deployed the sensors in the primary school, I thought maybe this is an in with the facilities side of things on the school. But it was actually the teachers who were worried that I was going to take it away at the end because they were using the temperature and humidity data and the particulates outside with the cars, using that in their other lessons so that they could get the kids to plot charts and that kind of thing. And I think that's, you're absolutely right. These new data streams are going to provide a lot of raw material. I think Laura won, we can all say Laura won is here to stay. I mean, a couple of years or so we were in doubt, but now we know for sure Laura won is here to stay. And I think with the changes that we see in society and in climate and everything too, and all the abilities that we've got, machine learning really grew. The vehicle, the train is still there. The only thing is that at some points we are going to do some things differently. Before we talked about edge computing, now it's called machine learning which we still move to the edge. And we're going to do these things more and more practically. So we're still going to work with Laura won with this chain of information in there. And we're going to enhance parts in that and study more on that and find new opportunities on that one on this chain, like AI, like displaying, like addressing big issues or big challenges that we've got in these societies in our societies. So yeah, I think it's only enabling us to grow further on that one. That's the way I will look at it. I saw a presentation from Edge Impulse about using AI to generate data sets that you don't have to actually do any work to collect. And I thought that was interesting. So maybe kids will learn to analyze data using data that they've actually collected and then scale that using data sets that are generated or data sets that are, you know, it gives them a perspective of what the data means and then an ability to understand it on a much bigger scale later as well to be really interesting. I hope we don't lose kids with clipboards. They're just doing little tallies. Counting cars and yeah. Yeah, I imagine everyone's done that. Nowadays you use sensor networks. Yeah. You can automate that. More sensor networks. My last question is, what is your most inspirational story from having used LoroNN in education? The fact that a student comes to me, sir, or well, it was an ACN student professor, I was in your classes and now I'm in a project, I'm doing these things on that one. It's the best reward you could get. They come up, you've planted the seeds, they carry it along with them and at some moment it comes out of the basket and hey, I'm going to use these, I've got a purpose for that and then you're successful. That's the feeling that I get. I think with those girls in the Roslyn Primary School, when one of them was just fascinated, wanting to know what every sensor did and I said this does this and then I turned around and she was taking the sensor and talking to another classmate saying, this is a sensor and it does this, isn't this? Oh, okay, cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, okay. You'll be good at that. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Oh, yeah. So some of the students I've worked with will be listening to this, so I'm not going to pick a favorite, but I would say, so I've hired 16 students now and for me, the inspirational bit is seeing what they become because I'm only ever going to give them their first job in IT before they go on to something else, but when they go on, they are that much more work-ready and sort of better equipped to join in the tech world and seeing what they become is fantastic. It's very rewarding. You can give a few examples. Sorry? You can give a few examples. Well, I've talked about Tracy, so yeah, going from not doing too well at her A levels and really being quite anti the education and the technology thing to now be doing a degree that goes across two countries and she's working with driverless vehicles and the idea of how you can use sensors and the environment to make passengers feel more comfortable in cars without drivers. I think I'm going to be grateful for whatever she produces. But there are... Well, I've got a guy who... He worked with me for a few weeks over the summer. I don't think I had very much to do with this at all. He spent the whole time arguing with me about what programming language we should use and then he did a great job. We were doing a digital playground for an agricultural college in Northwest Wales. And he helped write that and he was absolutely brilliant. But he went on... He decided not to go to university. He got a job with a startup in London. It's probably worth more than all of us now. So that was good. And then there are others who went from me to Cisco and have been getting promoted through there. Another guy who's become a real data whiz. Most of them go to university and then into technology. It's been very good. It sounds really special. What programming language was he... What was the right answer? So I was... Let's see, at the time... So on that project it was Node.js and JavaScript. And he was strongly advocating Rust. So he was way ahead of his time. And inter-functional programming. And that was the... He went to work for a company that was using Rust. And yeah, I don't think he ever looked back. He might have been right. Any other closing words? No. Thank you for having us. Thanks so much. Yeah. Thank you Remco. Thank you Al. Thank you Mark. Thank you for sharing the passion that you have in education. Yeah. So it was fun to be here. Good to have soulmates here on this day. On this day, on this discussion. This is also the last session on this stage. So we can say goodbye to everybody. Bye. Thank you.
