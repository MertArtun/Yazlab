How are you today? I'm good. You are right. I never taken no for a question. Well, that's why I wanted to use this nickname today to say you take no for an answer because we have two very special guests that were not easy to get a hold on. No, we're not easy. Ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for B.O.E. Canada's Dear Dr. Brown and Bimmel Capadia. Thank you. Thanks for having us. Thanks for having us. Guys, thank you so much. You guys are so busy. I know you're schedule is so tight. We have a lecture coming up in just a few days. So really taking a few moments that come down to the studio to say hi to us and talk to a little bit about what you plan to do. Once elected, we really do appreciate that. Oh, are you guys? By the way, Jeff Bennett, he wanted to stop by too, but he had a prior family obligation, which prevented him from attending. So Jeff, we love you too. But in any case, we do have a dear Dr. and Bimmel. So, Iliana, I know you have 900 questions for them. 900, no, I have more than 900. But how are you guys? How's the stress level? It's good. You know, it's been a wild ride, but it's been really gratifying. And we've had an amazing time talking to everyone in our camp, when we've been campaigning. I mean, just talking to our community, I think, has been so uplifting throughout all this. So it's been good. It's been a lot, right? I mean, I think we all underestimated a little bit of how much work goes into the campaign, while trying to manage your family, while trying to manage work, while trying to manage your own personal lives. But as Dierger said, it's been, you know, we're getting closer to the end here and a lot of the positives of the people we've met, people we've met along the way, people we've spoken with, things we've learned, it's been, it's been Karen is through. And by the way, we have to give a big shout out to all the volunteers that have been helping us. Absolutely. They've been all over the place. They've been canvassing for us. They've been on the socials. They've been knocking door to door. They've been helping us with merch, with, with, with, with punkards, with flyers, with whatever it may be. So we wouldn't be here. This part is, that part is easy. Well, they're making our part look easy with all this up yet. There's a lot of negatives when you run for office because how time consuming is, but the reward, the rewarding aspects of it. Years from now, you'll look back and say, it was the volunteers that we met. It was a people along the way. We met the issues that we addressed. And yeah, I certainly appreciate that because, look, you guys, this is a volunteer work job if elected. It's in a lot of ways of stanclets. In a lot of ways, people are going to say, we're going to walk up to you to supermarket and walk up to you in town and they're going to say, why can't you do this or that? So stepping up to the plate is really appreciated. So I guess my first question to you, and then Elie Andres gonna ask all the other questions. That's how we roll around here on the self-tax podcast. What made you guys decide to run for office? That's the first place. Good question. I need to go first. Okay. You know, when I first moved to Maplewood, I went to the board meetings all the time. I actually do policy for a living. I work for the government accountability office. So policy evaluation, how to make government more efficient, more effective, work for the people is what I do. I had so what I studied. And so I thought this is the way I can give back locally. When I went to the board meetings at that time, they were still, you know, they'd go 11 12 p.m. I had two little kids and I just, I couldn't take it on at that point in my life. Fast forward now, my daughter last year was the Board of Ed Rep. And so, you know, I had been following the Board somewhat over the years, but especially last year, I followed it because she was on the board. And last year was, I mean, between, you know, the push to get rid of honors, the, you know, the super-intendent, the, that intense meeting in November, the budget, the cuts to the arts, the cuts to the teachers. It was just, it was a lot. It was a lot. And I felt, it felt like to me kind of a now or never moment in a way I think, I know Bimmel's been feeling this way too. It's kind of like, what is going on? You know, this doesn't reflect who our community is. And so I thought, you know, if it's now or never moment, I have this skill set. I have the time in my life right now to serve. So let me try and help be part of the solution and get us back on track. So I like the fact that you, you basically follow any daughter's footsteps. She loves some big, big feet to the end. I would imagine, she's like, Mar, I'm not gonna come back to handle this. But I'll give them a hug. So I think for me, a little bit similar in that I've got my kids entered the district during COVID. And so they entered kindergarten and they were in preschool at the time. And I think everybody was forced to pay attention a little bit more to school. What was happening? Whether it be on Zoom or trying to do in person or, you know, some of the hybrid learning. But a lot of the issues that were probably plaguing the district were coming to the forefront, particularly with everything that's happening on the education side, right? And now you saw the fractures within the board of ed, you saw the fractures with the leadership. You saw the intentional distance that was being put from the parents to the teachers. So something just wasn't adding up. And I think even if you, as we got out of and dismounted COVID, parents that were involved, really didn't rebound back. They still stayed in a building. You had to be a little bit more vigilant in terms of what's happening. So I think a lot of these things that you've taken for granted were no longer taken for granted. And so as a result, I followed along a little bit more closer. And the spirit to want to run probably happened with Tony and Jeff's run last year. And I remember all of the things that you said, wow, there's an opportunity here to make some changes. Exactly right. They almost won. They almost won. And these guys, they, you know, they were saying a lot of things that we were thinking. They were representing a lot of things that represented what was at stake. Some of the shortfalls and the behaviors and, you know, policy decisions. So I went to a meeting, agreed that where I, you know, I became a lot more interested in what they were saying. And then who would have thought that that would have been? Yeah. And so when you're later, but you know, similar to what Deerjer was saying in terms of where you are in your life. And all this stuff is funny is we get into the end of this campaign run, whether it's winner or lose. You sort of wonder, how did you end up here? And while we go through that journey, we just talked about, I actually think a lot about now. My mother was a social worker. And never really paid attention to that as she was an immigrant that came in and walked away from a lot of that life behind her. But around this time, my two older brothers, there was one's eight years old and the other is four years old in the me. Around the same age as that I'm that right now. My brother started a nonprofit for overseas for African India, an education and water, water safety and water clean water. My brother became chancellor of his alma mater. And now here I am in the board of Ed, so it's a, it's a very uncorrected. The very uncorred, native, unc communicated path that we've all ended up, sort of thinking about what's next in our lives. And this functional family calling. It's an unintentional, right? It's an unintentional family. And I won't reveal my age totally, but I am starting. But I am starting to think about what's next. And I think this, this board of Ed, run could be a signal of some things that where I strongly believe in service. And then service should be nothing that's like, you know, shouldn't be short term of show is be a long term thing, but you know what you need to step it at some point. Yeah, and certainly, you know, I've told us before I've a friend of mine, he's in another township where there's less focus on everything. Like here we have a paparazzi and so much so to speak, the village grain and and you've got the social media sites and everybody seems to know what's going on. You have seven people running for office right now. He basically ran. He's and he said, if I'd want to run for a board of Ed, he said, I'll run and he basically go, congratulations. Yeah, basically this town's a little bit different. Yeah, there's a focus, there's a magnifying glass. How are you finding that? Are you finding your life is really changed in a good way and in a not so good way? You're thoughts on this one so far and what you've experienced. I've been talking a lot. You know, I think it's been on one hand. I haven't spent really any time. I wasn't even on Facebook before this campaign began. So in that sense, I've been above the fray, I think. It's been some of what's been going on in Facebook's been pretty disheartening at times in terms of people saying things about me that are certainly not true. But when that happens, I just call them all or Jeff and I say, I'm going to go out in Canvas and it just makes me feel so much better because I know the negativity that you might read. It's a few people. It's not and it does not represent who we are in so many by any means. And so that it's been disheartening there, but then when I go out and talk to people, it's so much the it lifts me up so much more, you know. So so it's been a little bit of a roller coaster in that regard. But I wouldn't change it for anything because I've learned so much from our community. I feel like. Again, I say this over and over. It's it's just awesome where we live. We have so many talented individuals from all walks of life diversity, you know, by every definition of the word. And so I really feel like this is such a special opportunity to try and get our district to match that. And I've been so like we'll said our volunteers, our friends, our neighbors. That's just been so wonderful. You know, I drive up my street and I see all these signs and I just, you know, it's so warm. It's wonderful. I was telling me the other day, I was I don't go to South Orange very often, but today that I went, I was surprised to see how many of your lawn signs like long streets. I turn around more and I'm like, guys, got south orange. It's like a purple river. Yeah, I was a purple river. How did you guys can't miss all those people? Like, I'm like, they really are like stepping it up here. That's true. Yeah, you really, you know what? Yeah. One thing is, hey, I'll take you alongside, but they have to note it take you alongside. Yeah. That took the volunteers and yourselves and coordinating people to come out and say, hey, we got you back. That's a, I want to be a heck of a challenge. Yes. It was a challenge for sure, but it was one that we signed up for, right? And I think so much of this was knocking on doors old school stud, right? I mean, we knocked on so many doors where somebody said, I lived here for 12, 20 years and no one's ever knocked on my door. Oh, I'm not on door. I'm not on door. But for the board of ed, so I think they've appreciated that freshness and putting a name to the face, not just digital avatar that's out there with a, you know, putting some personality behind it. And, you know, go back to your earlier question of like, what we went, what we learned out of this stuff. I mean, this town is wild. That's what I mean. I mean, for not being as involved in the, in knowing the board and knowing all the different, all the different pockets of communications that are out there, just learning about all these groups, all these, you know, different constituents or different plot lines and, you know, different things that are happening. It's, you know, you're just, you're just binging this content all the time, just trying to figure out like how do I navigate this stuff. But if anything, what you're dimensioned of what's happening on social, right, you cannot use that as an indicator as to what the pulse of the town is, right, it's no different than what's happening on the national scale, even global scale, right, you have to double source triple source check yourself and what's happening on here, it's easy to be a keyboard hero, it's easy to be a text, you know, it's right to say something, it's not true and in the second person says, well, I read it online and people tend to run with it. And it's not going to be a shout out to a well, you know, and you have these different, you know, buy your domes of where their own content is happening, they're not even talking to each other and all this stuff, right, so it's like, it's other part, part to the internet that no idea you've been existed. And again, so this is South Orange, sooma is a microcosm of what's actually happening on our national scale and this is just a board of election scale, right, think about what's the thing about all the misinformation that's out there on the national scale. Right, right, talk about misinformation and I want to touch on this briefly, but I don't want to spend too much time on it. Michelle Obama once said, when they go low, we go high, I feel your opponents went low with a flyer that they was in their name, they claim or a run at least told me he learned a bit as I learned of it. Directed at that you're running mate. I guess we could, running mate, I guess what we called a running mate. There was a group of former board of bath and it endorsed the, and while we were in Bethany and they signed it and I didn't, yeah, there was some that's kindly. It goes debunked, clearly debunked and that was wrong and it has no place for anything like that, it thoughts on on that. Yeah, how did you guys feel when you guys like, I'm sure your phone was blowing when that came out and a lot of people had questions, how did you feel when you read it like, you know, I think, you know, having that, you know, having that pit in your stomach when, you know, you're about to see something bad unfold or you get a, you know, a bad turn of the card or something like that. You know, there's a car crash on that. Yeah, you're about to see it. And I think for a deal, and by the way, she should come in next year is I think that's where we thought, okay, this is unfortunate. This is a, this is a side of the campaign that we thought might could have thought could happen, but we didn't think it would, right, and look, misinformation aside, there was a few things, there was a, there was a false narrative that was built, but there was also a fallacy of things that happened to get to that spot. I think the one thing that everybody should remember all your listeners is that that original flyer was actually submitted to, you know, one of the local, one of the local trades happened to tap or village green, whatever was any got rejected. Correct. It wasn't, it wasn't fact checked. It wasn't second sourced. It was, you didn't get it. And, and Oppo comment or a quote, you know, they put it up. It was, so they got to meet. So it was a, they put it up and then they realized quickly that it was reckless. Yeah. And then they put up on their own website, so they doubled down a second time. All right. So it's a realizing, this was inappropriate and wrong and, and, and, and, and, and, and not sense, they, they doubled down. But they are afraid that they might get sued, and that's why they took it down. It's, well, it's hard to say. Yeah. But I think the journalist just, you know, he said, now put it on. It said board of Ed stuff. I'll take it and then he said, and this is the tap into a Fred. I know Fred. I think Fred said, oh, we read it. He was like, nah, not for me. And then, when, you know, when we looked at a little bit further, we also saw that it was a sponsored post. So you, it paid a play. Look, I come from media journalists. So you get a paid a play. So again, some things that are there. But, look, at the end of it here, the message that was there. And I don't, we don't need to recap it because once you deposit that stuff, it's stuff and people's brains, it stays there. But this is a volunteer position. You mentioned it's a fanceless position. It's a volunteer position. We're doing this for all the right reasons. When you make insinuations like that, you put somebody's career, you put somebody's family, you put their friends, you put a lot of things at jeopardy. Yes. At what cost does winning mean to do that? I do think they even thought about that. It was like they wanted to destruction fall. I don't care what we're taking. It's just we're destroying it. How do you feel, uh, brown is about this? I mean, I think that was probably the lowest point of our campaign. For sure. I feel like, you know, like Bimmel said, just to blatantly put something out there that completely is misleading, not the truth, and can be life destroying. Uh, was just, it was unbelievable really because, again, I don't think it represents who we are as a community. And I don't think it represents who we want as leaders in our district either. I think, uh, yeah, I was kind of ambivalent to the whole process. I don't know anybody. That well. But when you see something like that, you're like, okay, not them. Yeah, that was basically my thought. Not them. If that's what they're going to do, that doesn't work. And I think that the back left backlash was swift. Right. I mean, I think you saw, you saw the community around me. Yeah, everybody was like, okay, a line. A rubicon was just crossed. Yeah. And now there's no going back to that. And, uh, are you surprised that having apologized to Jeff about this? Yeah. I'm surprised. I'm shocked, actually. I really thought they would, like, put out a statement and say, look, I'm sorry, you know, whatever. We didn't mean to go that far. You know, yeah, I think they're could have been from both sides because, I don't know, I don't know, but I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. But I think they were one of our own, and nothing, they haven't apologized, yeah. They haven't said, we have nothing to do with this, like, it feels like they are supporting this. Which is kind of disappointing. Sometimes you get to foreign trees. Have something to do with it. Foreigner trees. You know, that's, yeah, yeah, yeah, my number. But basically, I think hopefully do time, they'll say, wow. That's right. And it's weak. And it's weak. We also at the debate, the second debate, we gave them a chance to actually denounce it and they didn't take it. Now, that was a good opportunity to say something. But moving forward, if you get on the board, when you get on the board, what's the first thing you want to do? What did you want to do? What did you want? First thing you have to hand out. What's the first thing you're going to do? That first thing, if you could, just affect change immediately. What would that be? What? Oh, actually the bargently. The first bargently. Yeah, I think the budget is number one. You want to see the details? What exactly are there spending money? I mean, if you don't have a sound budget, if you don't have a budget that thinks over the years, you really, you can't do anything. And we have so many issues. We have to make progress on these equity recommendations. There are special education department. It's shocking how many stories we've heard about how that's feeling so many families and so many students. We can't, and I think part of the budget also relates to the bossing situation, because I think there is an opportunity there for some efficiencies without changing the initiative without, we support the intentional integration initiative and the rebalancing, but we think we can do it smarter. That's related to the budget. Certainly the budget, but also I think it's about meeting with the super, meeting with his administration and meeting with the other members of the board, because I do think the only way we're all going to succeed is if we start to take the temperature down and start to work like colleagues. Great. Great. Yeah, I think one of the first things that we would do is I think we try and get that spirit of collaboration going again. I think we'd want to bring the people that felt outside inside again, bring the teachers closer, bring the students closer, bring the parents closer, just to be the listening vehicle for that stuff. And, you know, I think part of the reasons why I also dear to NIR running is that you can only do so much from the sideline. And I think by getting into the board of edu, we're dealing with as much perfect information as possible. And I think it'll be our duty to be as transparent as possible to the community and try and get to the spot where we can, if decisions were being made, why were they being made, why was it communicated in a certain way? Again, it's easy to shake your fist from the sidelines. Yeah, we've all done that, right? But let's, if the other night can get in there, we are making our promise that we want to be accountable. We want to be transparent. We want to open the lines of communication. And by the way, that's not a board of edu, that thing. That's anything. I think as possible, you guys can try to make the board transparent because I know you guys are aware about this invoice, about hiring an outside person for the guidance thing. And apparently half of the board wasn't aware that this was happening. And they didn't know about the invoice. You think it's possible. You guys can make that like the mystery seconded in the way. I think is that what you're, the other way they found it was because of an old bra someone made. Like, okay, we fixed this. There's more transparent. Like, you guys are not into dark. Like, oh my God, I didn't know. That doesn't look like. Well, it seems like it was in 83,000, 500 pay to an outside consultant. 83,500 dollars. And I guess it was divided into two. It was divided into two. It was secretive. It was not secretive. Some people, what's your take on that? What's your feeling about that? That's why I'm talking about transparency. Like, how can we fix this? You know, I think that, you know, a, I do think that Mr. Bing, I think we've to give him some grace, right? This, what didn't run here. You know, yes. I think the first part of this didn't happen on his watch. No, I did not. So I think, you know, I appreciated the message that he sent out. I think he is trying to be more transparent in his communications. He's trying to be more candid. And in our community, even when you're transparent and candid, you're going to get, you're going to get hate, right? I mean, just social. Social. But having a board that will support his transparency and be transparent with him and try and be honest with him and be okay with him and the board admitting to mistakes. You know, I think that's one of the things that I feel like I noticed with this situation, with the director of guidance, it feels like no one is admitting to mistakes, right? And, and, and I don't have an ego. I mean, I'm, you know, I'm just a parent. Bimmel's just a parent. You know, we're just trying to do the best that we can. Sometimes we might make mistakes. And that's okay. Perfect. You know. And also being accountable to ourselves as leaders, hopefully by doing that, we can then create, you know, lead by example in a way so that other board members will act similarly. Right. With your children in mind, again, your parents, your kids are in the school system right now. This is power. This is the biggest, your children. The most important party of life and you're trying to give, not only them, but all these kids better opportunities in a school system. That's been. And the news, rather regularly over the last couple years, I friends in national news, I was a, a news producer for a long time, like jumping, hey, you're schools and the news again. Yeah. And hearing this for years. So there's, there's trouble and paradise. And I think you, you can start to correct that by emulating the behavior that you want to see, right? So with Mr. Bing is trying to get ahead of it, trying to, he's doing the best he can. Yeah, I'm sorry. You got Delta loaded deck. He's getting started. He gets, he gets, he's your, eloquently said, he deserves some grace. He deserves time to get there. But, you know, the leadership that he's trying to showcase, the board should reflect that. And it's a trickle down, right? Everyone should behave, model their behavior off of that. It's okay to get it wrong. It's okay to, well, sometimes it's not okay to get it wrong. But what, what it should be is the more that you can communicate this stuff out, the less other people are filling in the voids of information. Right. And I mean, I think that's what got us into this invoice mess is that there was just too much gaps of communication and silence that other people are starting to fill and wonder and question and, and all these things. That's what you look. You could have got ahead of it a lot earlier. And I'm sure if you were to ask Mr. Bing right now, he would, if he was looking back, he would get what we don't, maybe we should have done X, Y and Z instead of whatever it is. But we don't. We're kind of agreed that they should have hired that person to do the guidance, canceler and you're talking about the consultants. The consultant, I'm sorry. Yeah, did you agree with that? Or you would have handled it a different way? I would, I would not have let go of somebody in order to have that same person be replaced by a consultant unless there was like a wide derelection of duty or there was something that was there. I don't think that does not seem to be the case. So people believe it was like a waste of money. That that money could have used for that person to just got left. They could have used that for his salary. We still got left with a lot of kids not having the classes that they wanted. Oh, yes. We see lines around the block of kids trying to get into class and I'm reading online that some kids still don't have the classes necessary to get in the college. And parents are like, oh, no, you're not. And I'm, I'm, I don't know if the Spanish class or what, but there's, there's classes kids are not in. Who's the beaten? Yeah. That's, that's a scary situation. I think that dropped the bowl here. Who do we think? It's hard to know because some people in the board seem, they claim to know that they knew about, you know, they said that they knew about this. So I, I don't want to speculate. But I do agree what we spent pretty much 75% of this guy's salary or so on this consultant. And we got nothing essentially in return. And this was, you know, I think the director of guidance salaries like 137 or something. So that's a full years of work, right? That's not just putting together a master schedule. So, you know, what I'd like to do is kind of look forward. At the last board meeting, they presented this idea of the principle doing the schedule with two part-time counselors, helping him and then we're going to reimagine the director of guidance role. And it feels like maybe we just need to pause and really take a look at what do we need as a district in terms of getting our master schedule together if we need mental health, make, how do we make that part of it? But we constantly, it feels like we're constantly putting on band aids. And we think about band aids for one year at a time instead of really thinking it through. Even this new, you know, a, reimagine director of guidance, the first year they're going to be funded with a grant that we got, a one-year grant. Well, then I'm thinking to myself, how are you going to fund the person beyond this first year, right? And maybe maybe those questions are being asked behind closed doors, but our trust is solo, right? The parents' trust is low, the teachers' trust is low, the students' trust are low. So at this point, we're at a place where we need to over-communicate, right? So that these, you know, people don't fill in the gaps on Facebook with false information. I think that's where we want to try and come in is over-communicating away and help the super over-communicate. And by the way, it's not always misinformation, right? Sometimes you need the citizens to actually fill in the gaps correctly, right? It's not being done, right? I mean, I think we've got some very, you know, tenacious board watchers and people who really care about the community that are trying to do the right thing when they don't see it being done on the other end of it, right? So it's not just misinformation. Like, you need those warriors that are out there trying to like, you know, dig through the garbage cans and figure out what's going on, right? And that's, and that's, that's important. Yeah, I mean, what if we hadn't, what if someone hadn't Oprah then for me? Shatsin, that's right. Yeah, yeah. Well, what would have happened? Right, yeah. It's, uh, right, that's right. That's, that's someone I've actually got to the effort of, of finding what was going on here. Um, it wasn't, again, and we were talking about transparency and things of that nature. This was the, uh, not transparent. So we really don't know who dropped the ball, who hired that person. Yeah. You don't know yet? I think it's hard to know from where dear to an IR, right? Yeah, you guys would have, you know, that would be the The four of us together are now, uh, I'm not going to know as much as what we're in there. That's why we want to get in there to understand, you know, what went into the decision making and how we got to where we are. And, and by the way, I mean, dear to and I talk about this a lot with Jeff as well, is that some of these things that we're talking about are basics. Like a schedule has been happening at the high school level at the school level for decades. And I don't understand why that has to be something that needs to be reimagined or rethought. Like these are just, I don't know. Does seem to be basic table stakes that we should be able to do with the as they just are. Well, you guys find out who was the plan. We'll come. We'll come. There was a call. Give us a call. So we're going to take a quick break here. Uh, commercial break. We'll be back in just a bit. I, I've got the board. It's spelled B O R E D.

We are having great conversation. All right, yeah. Yeah, really, I'm having the time in my life with Deirdre Brown. Deirdre Brown. Hey, you know, it's our first candidate coming to our podcast final. We're in Bimmocopaddi. That's right. Yes, we do have candidates finally willing to sit down with us for these hard hitting questions, Eliana. I think you and I are the next 60 minutes, perhaps, you know, they're when they're coming up next on 60 minutes. I'm working on a lot of these questions. When you guys were candidates, did you guys see any other annex chairs? We'll save that for the next summer talks podcast. That's for a specific to the election. That's a G-rated summer talks podcast, right? So the after-hour summer talks podcast. That's right. I did see a pineapple. Yeah, I did see that. Yes, I did. How am I going to? But we actually wanted to talk about Eliana. You had a question about the teachers. Yeah, yeah, I've been to a couple of debates, and it seems like teachers, things is not really talked about. I know that right now, teachers are not very happy. They're not even comfortable. They don't know where they're going. I'm sure most of them are thinking of leaving. There's no. There's no. There's no. What are they? What are they losing teachers? Good teachers. We're losing teachers around happy. We've had Rosio Lopez on who's the teachers, union president, and she says, you know, the morale is not high, right now. Exactly. The morale, you know, and now with this contract that it's not going on. Contribute their past, it seems to be like, hey, they be those better opportunities and other districts, and teachers who have the skills and the experience, our head and the other districts. What are your thoughts on all that? Yeah. You want to go? OK, yeah. So I think we're in almost no member now, right? And the fact that a contract negotiation has dragged out this long is, it's almost an almost untenable. In any negotiation, we've said it before on the trail, is that it shouldn't be something where either side is so far away in their demands that it's going to take a long time to get to the middle. You kind of know where it's going to go, right? And I think what could have happened here in the beginning is, like, we all know the teachers deserve a contract. We all know they deserve a race. We all know that we need to repreciate the teachers. I don't think these things are given and they're understood. So if you actually go into that in a negotiation, you can get to the right spot really fast. And it shouldn't become anti-agnistic. Nor should you be using your social media, your own social media, or the public to actually use as negotiating leverage. These are just tactics that will just pin each other, pin people against each other. And you actually lose sight of what you're trying to get done. So that's an unfortunate thing. But I think for Deer Droneye, just over the campaign of getting actually to talk to a lot of the teachers. Have you? We have. We've been really fortunate with that. We've... What's their feelings? What did you get from them? They're really unhappy. We've met with some, uh, certain, certain folks in the so-called, and we're, and, um, and yeah, I mean, I think there is a overarching, low morale in the sense of just not being listened to, or brought to the table, or being even appreciated and supported. One of the, one of the things that we learned and Deer Droneye, as well about this, is that they hadn't been brought into any policy decisions since 2020. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So these teachers are on the front lines of most of the decisions that get made from the administration and the district. And there should be ample time and opportunity to bring them in on the upfront, or get a chance for their feedback. That is one of the first things that we should just try and correct, right? That's like the football players coming off the field, and you're not saying, well, what's going on out there? What did you say? What happened? You're right, as he is. Right, I mean, that's, you asked the people that are in the, that are in the, Mr. the battle in the middle of it. And they're, that's his 2020. That's, that's, that's amazing. Yeah. They feel like they're blind. They don't even know what's going on, on the appreciate. And yeah. And I think, I mean, we've already learned so much, and I would imagine, we'll learn so much more when on the board, if we try and bring, and bring the teachers in to talk about policy ideas, we have monitoring how policies are going. You know, they, they gave us a lot of feedback about their experiences with the intentional integration initiatives. Oh, that's a good thing. Better than them. Right. Exactly. When we had that question about meals for children, and then, them not getting their meals, because they were moved to different school, the teachers had talked to us about that before. That question at the debate. Oh, the breakfast. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, that they used to have in said, four of them, now that they changed to another school, they don't get the breakfast. Mm-hmm. And so, and little, this is a very small example. But one teacher was talking about in their room, the construction workers hung the hooks up so high, and so close together. A, the children can't reach them, and B, you know, you're going to be spreading life. Right? And so that's a very, very small example. But I think with the intentional integration initiative, kids not getting meals, kids not getting the special education supports that should have followed them. I mean, these are the things that the teachers see right every day. And we should be absolutely tapping into their expertise and their experience. And I think another part of, you know, going back to the teachers' in-pass is because our budget has not been transparent for so long. You know, we used to do more reporting publicly prior to 2020, than we've been doing under burnside. I think there's this, also, it goes back to lack of trust. Because they don't necessarily believe that the district doesn't have the money. I mean, no one really knows, right? Where are the money? Yes, I have the community, I really believe we have the money, and the other half of the money. We don't have the money. A lot of teachers like, they have the money. And they're just holding into it. What are your thoughts about that? Well, so you can't blame them for their logic, right? So, play it out. Say, there's a, there's a budget shortfall. You have the, the reduction in force. You talk about supplies being cut, teachers being cut, power professionals being cut, director of guidance being cut. But yet we can find 83K for a consultant. And you don't have a contract yet, and you're worried about where the money is going, or where it's coming from. Of course, the teachers are going to make the money. And they're higher the power as a gun, and they're higher the power as a gun. But yeah. So again, those things like that, you can't, of course, you can draw a line through that stuff, and you can't, you can't fall for the logic of wondering, is there something there? And again, communication, right, knowing what's, if you have an opaque budget process for the last few years, you're, you're going to be, you're only dealing with the information that's being handed to you, and then otherwise you're digging for it. Well, a little shout out to Marshall School and the teachers there. I'm friendly with quite a few of them. Um, these are two candidates right now that have you back. So, um, Hey, shout out to Marshall, and we have Marshall, okay, shout out to Marshall, and we have Marshall, and we have Marshall, but that's specifically Marshall. I have some good friends there. These are concerns that they have. I think you just, we'll have their own concerns. Sure. Yeah, and I'll just, I mean, I'll add, I mean, my daughter has had some, I'm, I mean, my, both my kids have had some amazing teachers, but at the high school, uh, and I'm, I'm worried that my son, who's an eighth grader, will not have, have those teachers. You know, I think that's how, how low it's feeling right now. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, this, look, the, the, I'm willing to take, if I was to have a, unofficial polling of, of residents in South Orange, Maplewood, I guarantee you a lot of parents would be able to name most of their teachers growing up. I agree. Absolutely. And I would guarantee you that they could not name, Hat and you really have as many of their bosses after they had graduated. Right, that's true. Oh, that's true. So, this, we all know that teachers are, leaves such a high impression as to shaping of who you are, what you want to be, how to behave. They, I mean, after the parents, they are the, the, the people that are seen and on the front lines of what your child is going through in shape. And they're like tattoos in your memory, right? Right, right, right of your life. You have to try to remember the last 10 World Series winners. You can't do it, but you can't remember the top 10 teachers. Yeah, you know, you could list it probably real quickly. I know I can't, Mr. Hunt, top of the list, you miss Colbert. They go, say, no, I mean, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Mr. Hunt, hey, hey. And I remember Mr. Hunt's real, yeah, yeah. I'm keeping, you know, I'm not on Facebook as much and stuff. I would be more because of the campaign. But the only person I was seeing touch, after all these years, more than some of my high school friends, was actually my art teacher for my school. Oh, yeah. And so that, that's something to be said. That's, again, I'm not gonna date myself too. Yeah. And that's almost 30 years later. And you're still in touch. I just all right, yeah. You should call Mr. So and so on. It's always, you know, as a parent, a quick tangent, I always feel very weird when I meet my kids' teachers and try and call them by their first name. Yeah, it's just like a new one. I want to be like, yeah. I'm the self-admisturizing. How are you doing? It's not the ethical. You call them first name? I go and miss it. I go and miss your miss. Oh, yeah. It's the end of the game. That's funny. Yeah, yeah. I'm doing a special book called The Bull. You're a teacher. You're that your title, Mr. Yes, yes. Unless it's Doctor. But that's usually, it's actually in the college level, right? All of a sudden, you know, but I'm a school district and the parents always refer to me as Mrs. Castellia. They never do my first name. So I guess the question is, Mrs. Castellia. Oh, Ms. Castellia. It's respect. Yeah. Respect. Yes. Yeah. If they're probably not my four-year-old, you know, I can't go to the school. I feel so wrong when they do the Mrs. Castellia. Yeah. I'm not. Yeah, so I'm going to call my wife, man. She was like, why don't you call me, man? Like, because you were like 40 years older than her. But she didn't like that. Back. Sorry. I shouldn't have told that. Sorry. But getting back to what we're talking about. Dear, what does you question? And I hope I'm not throwing a curveball at you. Fairway, fairway. The, the, the, the, you were again by your opponents. It seemed like they kind of said something about you, not really having Frank Sanchez as back during that whole mess. And that wasn't true. Much sharing a little bit about, you know, that whole situation. I mean, you were a friend of Frank. I mean, we're all in terms of purposes. Yes. As many of us in the community. Yes. I am actually friends with Frank and I am a friend of Frank. Okay. How you talk to Frank? Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, Mr. Sanchez has been, you know, so great with my daughter in the high school. I mean, they have such a wonderful relationship, especially just because if they're working together when she was on the board. But regardless of that, I mean, if you're here in the high school, Mr. Sanchez, there was not an event that you went to that he was not, he is not there, you know, whether it's Martin Luther, Martin Luther King Day celebration, a football game, a chorus concert. You know, he is our high schools biggest cheerleader in fan. And I think he has brought this sense of community and pride that has really been lacking. And he really seems to be able to relate to so many of the students. So he's, I mean, so when when what happened last year happened, I was, I was extremely upset. It was, I think he was, his treatment was terrible by our district. And I was a big friend of Frank. I went to the rally. I donated. I had a sign. I posted and asked other people to donate. So, you know, certainly when I wrote about that and said, I guess I said, I was a proponent of friends of Frank. And I think verbally I said, I was a supporter. Yeah. I was there. Yeah. I mean, I just meant I was a huge supporter of that initiative. I'm very appreciative of the people who started that initiative. And you were responsible, like, I made the group. No, I was a little more vulnerable. Yeah. But you were on support. I mean, you were there. When he got retired, I'm sure you have the, like, so many others in the community. Yeah. You had your fist pumped in the air. Right. And I think, you know, I certainly, it's kind of like me saying, I'm a huge supporter of Kamala Harris. Right. I don't think anyone assumes that I'm meaning I'm running Kamala Harris's campaign. Right. Where you're done? Yeah. So, I mean, that's how I viewed it. That might be easier by the way. Right. And then running before the bad end, so I'm about to run. Yeah. But no, I didn't intend for it to come across that way. And I am appreciative to those people because that was a, that was a great campaign. I think it really showed the community support. And so much of our community loves Mr. Sanchez. And what he's done for the high school. Well, he's back. And I think, you know, you were a big part of that. So thank you for supporting him. The kids love him, parents love him. You know, I don't know him. Not everybody. You know what? Everybody I speak to speaks to the world of them. Right, Atlanta. I mean, very few people I've met have anything negative say, but I'm going back to you guys. Okay, because he got his job back. Now we got to get you guys. Got to get to your job. You're volunteer job. Is there anything that, well, you know, seen Hall today. Here's a good question actually. Well, here I am. I'm saying good question. I'm telling myself, I'm asking a good question. See, Hall prepped today had an incident. It was basically, it was a lockdown. Security. I'm not exactly sure about the specifics, but obviously it was very frightening for the children. It turned out to be, the police were nothing happened, not quid. Security's a big concern with our school systems too, with our schools. What do you thoughts on security? Are we secure enough? Do we need more security? How do we protect these kids? It's a dangerous world today. I mean, and this, this is a question actually brought up last night by a student at the debate. And today I had a, I had a friend text me saying is everything okay at the school, maplewood school. And so I, you know, I immediately, I was shaking. I thought it was the Columbia High School, then I found out it was seen Hall, but I was shaking. We've so many people in our community, their kids go to school there. Yes, that's true. It really brought it home. For the past three years, the student board, representatives have brought up security as a number one issue to our board of education and to the superintendent. Many times, and still, you know, we still, we still aren't taking it as seriously as I think we need to. You know, last year there were kids that came into the school. We just had a kid come into the school a week or two ago. You know, as a member of the board, I hope that, you know, I would love to work with Mr. Valice. I think, you know, he's the head of our security. I'm sure he has got wonderful ideas on what more we can do. I think it'll involve, you know, having security guards that are trained, possibly thinking about what are those security guards paid? I mean, certainly they should be paid in the amount commensurate with the importance of the job. We need standard operating procedures and we need expectations. I mean, I think I'm not sure what the high school is where kids are now, but last year, kids were expected to wear their ideas, but I don't really think that was an expectation. Kids really didn't wear their ideas. And so if no one's wearing ideas, you don't know who is should be in the building in who shouldn't be. And so I don't know where that is today, hopefully it's better, but security, I do think needs to be taken seriously. Yeah, and I think it's one of those unfortunate realities that we're in right now. And everything that we've heard so far and what happened at CETEN Hall, well, you know, obviously thankfully nothing serious happened, but protocols were followed. It sounds like the students knew exactly what they needed to do. Again, unfortunately, that has to be a routine that they need to practice, but the students knew what they had to do. Protocols were in place, the police responded accordingly. So that there's an upside in terms of at least you know that there was something in terms of something might have worked. God forbid that was going to be a grim reality. Again, it still stinks that this is the one that we have to live in. It's always heartbreaking when you see, you know, numbers outside the windows and why that has to be the case now, which is also unfortunate. But we're a lot of these security things for me having two kids in elementary school. It's a bit new of hearing a lot of this stuff because when I go, John, my kid that's South Mountain, it looks pretty secure. It looks like that's the right thing. But again, I who knows who happens at the high school level when you have, when you have, and they should, they should have mobility. The kids should be able to room free. They should be able to do the things that they need to do as teenagers, right? We all remember what it was like growing up in. I know, ladies, you said that you went through the windows. I said that when, yes, it's a climate of second, the English class was second floor. You could jump out and it was kind of bushes there. And we used to do all the time. I could say, we just have to jump right up. I could say with confidence at least two of us in this room have done that. You know, and then you'd have to go around. That was like, you have to go through the door and help the principal. But now you know, you wouldn't get in so quickly. Did you have your help from a Jew then? The Jew from the Jew. I used to have a Jew from, which is like, you know, Jewish curly hair. And she called, what's you called, from? I've heard from you. But anyway, it was like, yeah, as you could see, it's long gone. Yes, but back in the day, I had a wonderful head of hair. I don't think anybody has to worry about shooting in every now. You know, we'll go in and out and like that. No, you never, never crushed your mother. Ah, the good old day. But we were young and beautiful. Oh, it's hard to be a kid now that it was a weird one. We were a kids. Even the ID, I know the kids have the, with the ID, is my kid when he left for school, he's 25 now. But you know, I, I was, if your head wasn't attached to your shoulders, you forget that too. He would forget his book bag. He'd forget, you know, the homework. He would, my daughter. Two sneakers. Wrong. Those aren't matching sneakers. And now you're asking to bring an ID also. I don't know. It just, I understand the issue, but you will really put in the burden on kids to put it on. But you're going to want that. Exactly. The kind of ideas they have to be vigilant. They have to have their, you know, literally they had on a swivel. They have to understand all these things. These. Why can they leave the ID at school? Because in the school district, where I work, the teachers collect them when they're leaving. They collect the idea when they come back and they give it to them. That way, it doesn't get lost. Maybe they should do that. You perhaps, my daughter, you know, many times I have to drive the ID to my daughter because they won't let her just go. And I guess it's a time consuming situation, especially without having to, I mean, what, how many kids are in the Columbia? I just got the thousands, three times. I mean, it's like a little city, right? And also it's like, take a lot of time to. You. Yeah. I think we just need to, you know, it's like so many things in our district. Take a step back and look at what we're doing. What are other districts doing and doing well? And how do we copy that? You know, right? Right. And so, you know, the IDs, maybe that is like, I don't know. I mean, maybe that is a good way to do it. Yeah, they collect them. But what is, is what's your message to the thousands of families in the community? And so many of them, maybe private school, maybe, you know, maybe this is not working. What's your message moving forward to these parents that, I said, maybe I get to get my kid out of the school system? What would you say to them if they, you're not going to door and I said, I think I'm taking my kid out. What do you think I should? I know there's so many of them in seeding, you know, seed and prep, like a lot. I mean, I think that's kind of why we're running. In a way, you know, I think we see that. We've felt it in some ways ourselves. You know, why can't why is our district not serving all of our kids? Our community's awesome. I mean, I talked to parents. They've sent their kids to private school. They don't want to move because they love our community. But it's a shame that you're paying for these taxes and you don't feel like you're, your school can serve your child. And so for us, it's kind of like, help, you know, come on board with us. We're just parents. We're the voice of parents. We can bring that to the board. And it's about level setting in a way. It's level setting the temperament of the board working with the superintendent. And then getting back to basics, you know, the bushing, the budgeting, scheduling guidance. These are things that are very, you know, every school district has to do on an annual basis. And we just seem to be faltering with it in recent years. And I think if we can get those things on track. And by the way, we need to get those things on track because we haven't. We do have these important equity recommendations. We have these important special education recommendations. We have to rebuild our arts programs. We have to be able to provide athletic facilities for all of our students. You know, this is just part of being a school district. And so for us, it's kind of like, let's re-center. It feels like in recent years, we like to just throw things on the wall and see if they work. Yes. And we don't really think them through. We don't think them through one more planning. And we don't think through every single ramification of them. And I, you know, I think for us, we'll bring that temperament of, okay, let's bring people in. Let's think of ideas. And let's workshop these ideas all the way through before we start to implement them. And then when we implement them, let's make sure the teachers are prepared to implement them. Let's make sure the administrations prepare to implement them. And then as we're implementing them, let's use data to see what are our goals. Are we making progress? You know, these are things that you do when you're implementing policy. It's not, it's not rocket science, but it seems like we've struggled with that in recent years. And I, and I, if we can do that, I truly believe we have, we have such a wonderful community. We have a chance at a new beginning with a new superintendent. It feels like with the right leadership behind him, which is thoughtful, which is accountable, transparent, bringing together the people that have been felt, you know, the parents, the teachers, the students that have been left out on the sidelines. It feels like we really, we can get back on track. And we can't serve all of our students. Yeah, I think when the, what we owe it to ourselves to have the district match the community, right? It's what we all talked about. It's what we all strive for. And if there is that deviance, that deviation between what the district and what the town looks like, parents will then make that decision to take their kids out of district or put them in the school, we'd rather it not be fit a company where they see this no other path. And if we can get those basics right, then let it be a decision what they make is right for their kid. Because, by the way, I mean, not every kid is built for public school. Sometimes it might make sense to go to boarding school or private school, whatever it is that they had that access, they had that choice to do. So fine, but let's not make it because there's no other option because they've given up on the public school system. When you give up on the public school system, it's a downward spiral for everything. And it's really hard to get out of that, right? So this is a spot right now and due to set it perfectly with everything that we're talking about in terms of our campaign. This is that moment, right? We are at an inflection point. You hear that a lot at the federal level, at the nation level, and all that stuff, but it is in our town. This is a critical, critical moment in terms of where we decide to be as a district. So the stakes are high. The voters have a choice. They know the things are important for them. And we have to reflect that. And I think we've done a pretty darn good job of going on our listening to our hearing, trying to understand, absorb as much as we can, communicate at the stuff out as much as we can to the rest of the, to anybody who's listening to your listeners, to the voters, to the people that are attending the debates, the people on social to when we're going door to door, because we have to reinstall confidence in the neighborhoods. We have to reinstall confidence into the teachers, the students, the parents, and that's going to take, that's going to take nine board members, it's going to take an effective administration, it's going to take new leadership, it's going to take a lot of buy-in to get us to where we need to be. And you can't do it by having division. You can't do it by divisiveness, right? I think the community is ready. There we're playing, I'm telling you, there's a lot of the, I don't have the drama, I don't have the transparency. And the negative, the negativity, the negativity, not that is, it just, I read someone, and post online, they should all go and have a clean slate with nine and the fresh people. If you can close your eyes and think for a moment, what the district should look like, you'll quickly find out that it is worth saving, it is worth fighting for, and it is worth voting for. So yeah, we have a choice, and it's not, you know, when we talk about that, putting your stomach that we said at the top, right? Like we all kind of got that a little bit. And the parent talked about that last night asked about the drama going on, like, can you? And yeah, the response was a little weak, I'll be honest with you. I was hoping that someone, not talking about you, we talked about the others, that are in the thing, I was hoping like, no, we didn't know more drama, like I wanted to feel that. They're like, we're willing to do that. Because a lot of people feel like the fortivist divided into, you got the soldier warriors group and then you got the other group. And then that's where the victory starts because they have their own agenda, and then there's another agenda, you know? Well, I'd say, look, a agenda is, that's a tough work, right? It was when you came to help. But what you did is they got their being influenced by the social group. And as people that you think they're influenced, and they're like, absolutely. Well, this politics, this politics, exactly. On a local level, which I think has gotten a little out of control, that's my take. Hi, guys. Look down. You guys got that? I don't know if we have it. I mean, I mean, are you going to be those board of eight? You're going to call them out? You did wrong. That's not. Are you going to be that? Are you going to be the quiet one? Like, I'm not going to touch that. Like, I'm not putting you in this spot. But, you know, some people like to see that. They've been called out if they didn't see it. Yeah, I think, look, I think, Deer's going to have the right tone, tenor, temperament to have polite discord. Yeah. It doesn't mean, putting somebody, it doesn't mean talking at, doesn't mean talking down to, it doesn't mean negative body language. It doesn't mean, you know, gaslighting or, you know, whatever behaviors that we might see out there before. But it is taking it head on and calling them out. And by the way, we would expect the same thing. Deer's your own, I and Jeff would expect the same exact thing. If we were saying something incorrect or behaving incorrectly, you got to be able to. What are you like about you guys? You guys are very approachable. Like, even though I didn't know you guys, you guys didn't have that cold front. Well, there's just a approachable compare to you. Ah, you know, because, yeah, they are. Yeah, they are. They are very lovely people. People come and, so if you're basing in vote on them being lovely, they are lovely, but they're also, as you can hear, they know what they're talking about, they're prepared, they're ready to go. Oh, I can vote for a candidate that ignores me or don't give me the minute to hear me out or anything. I'm sorry, if you give me the wrong look and you pass by, I'm not giving you my vote. I know, I'm not giving you my vote for me. I'm pretty good. But I have the most important question to me so the night and so many people are talking about it on the social media sites, on the long side, how did you decide whose name came first, second and third? Oh, that's everybody wants to know. That's a great question. A theoretical order, isn't it? No, that would be Bennett Brown, Capadia. You guys did it out for a better quarter or no? No, no. Your brown Bennett Brown. Yes, brown, because the way that's for him. That's right. It was chivalry. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. You had to be in the bean and you're like, I guess, I'm last. Yeah. It's a ring on with the fun section. Yeah. I know you guys are on time. You got things you got to do. But you have a minute for Eliana's fun with the question. What's your question? Yeah, she's a good thing. She loves Eliana. I was asking her people personal questions. Hi, do you have a question? That's me Mrs. Noz. You have a favorite restaurant and hopefully it's coded or sponsored. Well, if you had plenty of people, but the code understands that there are other restaurants too. And he's dying to be here. For me and buy is here, but what's a favorite place to go? Like, hey, let's go over there. Like, you're going to. Where am I running for a cold beer? I will say, well, pepper, cold beer. But it used to be reservoir pizza. Well, it was a wonderful. It was a casual link. Great pizza. Casually, you got to respect that. Don't I never know where to park anymore? Because that grab a lot. I'm always breaking the law a little bit when I go there. But bunnies pizza has a lot of time spots. That's a classic. That's great. So I've only discovered it maybe a couple months ago. So have you met Leslie? She's always sitting there and she's there on the, on the taking the order. Yeah, I have to get her out of there. So, yeah. If you introduce yourself, she's lovely. I have to introduce yourself. She will never forget her. Never forget her. I'm in. I'm a Sabatino's pizza. Sabatino's pizza. I'm in a business with just there. I am getting, we, we, we there for that. But I might have been a little hard to get a pizza that day. But yes, Sabatino's he just opened what five, six years ago. And, you know, he's, yeah, I mean, he's got to go on on. You know, we live some talented people in this community. And, and our school's are some two very, I mean, you go to the, the sites, there's the, the, the, the people who lived here a long time ago, whatever, remember when we lived in Southart, they talk about this place glowingly. Talk about the restaurants and, and where they went after school and grunnings ice cream and, uh, I don't know if kids today are going to have that same thought moving forward. It's been a rough last couple of years. But, uh, it, this, as you said, this is a wonderful community. And, and we're happy wonderful people are want to, want to, the next generation of leadership. And I think that's what you guys represent. Yeah, and I think, I mean, I do think that our kids, I mean, there is a sense of community here, right? That's why we're all so passionate. And I think that does rub off on our kids. So I do hope that, you know, maybe, you know, the bear was made off of, uh, Beggos, Beggos, Chateau. And, um, maybe, you know, 20 years from now, they'll be another TV show made off of the Beggos Chateau. That's right. Yes. That's right. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. That's right. That's right. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. That's right. That's right. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, you're right. So anyway. You're one last question. Because I know these guys got to run. Yeah. Well, we're not gonna win all I should. I know you guys said that you guys haven't been on Facebook. Like recently, you became part of Facebook and probably Instagram too. Breathing everybody. You got a favorite poster. Like someone you read here, like, oh, I like the how that people express or talk. Like anyone jumps in mind. As far as posters are concerned. Yeah, I'm posting. And from any group can be from your company. She's our lounge or talk. As long as you don't say, Chris Traskin. I don't even think. I love Chris. I cannot, you know, I am not. You can't have a podcast. No, honestly, honestly, what happened was once the whole thing with Mr. Sanchez happened to me, I have not been on Facebook. You just told me, read. I don't even read. You don't. No, because I just, I feel like I just don't want to see the talks. I just don't, I don't want to be exposed. I don't blame it. You know what? It's, it's great when someone says something nice about you. But, you know, even on this podcast, I've read, I've had, I'm someone saying something rude about my mind. I know what it is like. I was like, oh, that's just how it's going to be. But then it rules your day. You know what I'm saying? I'm on. I'm just like, I'll read 10 or anything about it. So one person will say something negative. And then that's what's sticking in my head. Right. And I mean, I do have, I do have friends that will text me. And they'll show me certain things. You know, they'll show me all the positive stuff. And they'll be like, oh, someone said this, but everyone else said this. So they'll be like, I'll help me feel better. And they kind of give me the play by play. But I don't need to see it myself. Look, if we talk about this social impacts of what it does to the kids. And stuff like that. Imagine what happens to, to, it happens to adults too. And now for a little bit of a campaign. And now for your trying to win votes. And you're trying to go with some ants, competitive. Yeah, it's a, it's a tough place to be. So I commend Deirdre for for the interesting stuff. Yeah, we can't restrain. I will admit that the banter on on so much talks is pretty funny. Yeah. Oh, really? Yeah. I can't remember some of the guys names, but the ones that they get, you know, they give you crap Lee and stuff like that. So Jay, hey, well, so that some good humor in there. Very, very hard to hear. Yeah. Now it's, it's, right. I go, things get heated, but I think generally speaking, it's always the same situation where I call it a mess. But you're online, you know, you fight and then you run into the guy and you realize he's nice. He's nice. And that was what's nice again about the podcast and having you guys come in because again, it was an opportunity to meet you as opposed to just seeing you at a, in a debate where questions are being fired actually. Too many to say answer. No, no. I don't know how you can win. Many answers. One minute. I know. You're never finished your thought. Right. Yeah. Yeah. But people in the second. I know. Right. Right. But they put the 30 seconds. And you can see a pretty sweaty guy. That's what we're talking about. You got a sneeze, right? And that's like 30 seconds. I can watch out. Right. I think you got 30 seconds left. Yeah. If you say board of ed, that's, it's the board of ed education. You lost a second. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's the view's acronym. So every minute count. Every minute count. Every second count. Every second count. So we are, so we are, Eliana, I think we are. I am asking everybody, please come out and vote for Brown, Bennett, and Capadia. Yeah. That's, I am. But for the guys, I think you got the vote. The judgment of the right temperament. I know Jeff Well, he is, he's brilliant. He's a brilliant guy. He's been there before. And you guys, you guys are ready for this. So, uh, Eliana. How bi is because they came to the park. They got, I got, I'm not sure. That's right. So anyway, guys, I guess we'll, uh, we should call today. So I'm sure I'll see you guys in the vote because I got a vote. So probably see one of you guys doing. And chances are you guys, what's this week? You have to be knocking on doors. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we'll be at Halloween down in the village tomorrow. Oh, you guys, I'm going to be there. Old school campaign. Old school campaign. Old school campaign. Now, can on doors, ground in pound, will be at the parade. We'll be out there and Halloween. Have you guys, can the other candidates campaigning at the same place? How do you guys get along when both of you guys are campaigning? It's like, it's like, west side story. Ah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, they're over there. Let's go this way. The room is like new and from side, I felt like, oh, room. Right? I think it's been, it's been, it's been collegial for the last year. That's what you guys are. Cam, guys. And you see one of their signs. And do you guys go inside of the house? Would you just skip? You walk by. Yeah. You know, you guys, you respect the sign. Yeah. You respect the sign. Yeah. I ran for office, uh, uh, uh, uh, maple attach to committee. I did run like, like, you guys are running for a reason. I ran just to try to be popular. But, uh, but I spent a 45 minutes with this one guy. And I told him what I was going to do when I was going to make these changes. And everything was going to be great. And I asked guy, you're long. So I don't know. And he said, let me think about the laws. I go there the next day. So you want the law and study had delucous law and sign. Oh, it's one. Yeah. It feels best for you. I. Oh, I got it. It's not really. It's interesting. You look at it. It's not even a district leader, which I didn't know. I was an amateur. I just remember the next day I had my sign in the car. Like, you know, I think I'll get it then. That's funny. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess we'll call it an evening. Oh, I forget. Any store. I'm trying to write things up. I'm trying to write any stores and doors. And you guys sometimes I see like there's some business that put the, Yeah, we saw the see there is that urban castle on valley in, in the Maplewood. Mm-hmm. You wish kniter to go stop there. It's a quarter. It's tough to get businesses because they don't want to run. Right. They don't want, well, you know, Yeah. I don't want to get my door to you. And they're, they're, there's supporters. I'm going to come in and, you know, so that's, it's, it's, it's a tough spot to put a business in, but occasionally they, Oh, I got you 20 volts. I have 20 people every year that's me. Who should we work for board of ed because they do the in-home. And they're not into the board of ed like thing. Yeah. Well, actually from Bonnie's put my sign up when I was running, I was running a major. Let's go. Let's go. I was running on the South RNG. I got to do something that my sign was in South RNG. I was in South RNG. I was in South RNG. So that is good. So yeah, my 20 people are giving you three. There. So you got 20 people. Thank you. I mean, thank you so much for having us. I want to spend a lot of fun. Guys, you're a lot of fun. Thank you for your time. Thank you. All right.
