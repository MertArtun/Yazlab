Identify objects around you in English. The first way to stop translating in your head is to identify the objects around you in your target language. So if you're studying English, that means you look at the objects around the room. Look at the things in your life. Don't think of them in your native language first. Think of them in your target language first. So if I look around the room, I see a computer. I shouldn't think my native language word. I should think my target language word. So start with the items and the situations in your everyday life. If I say computer in English, maybe I should say computer in Japanese. I should say not, I don't know, water in English. I should say omizu in Japanese. So start associating the words in your target language with your everyday life now. So if you're studying English, that means start getting familiar with the things in your everyday life in English. Repeat phrases you hear native speakers use. Tip number two is to repeat the phrases that you hear native speakers use. So if you're watching this channel for example, or you're watching a TV show or a movie, listen for the way that native speakers make those phrases. If you hear a phrase you have never heard before, or you hear an interesting combination of words, try to repeat them yourself. Don't just listen, try to save them yourself. If you're in a public space and it's difficult for you to do that, find practice in a place where you feel more comfortable. Maybe if you have some private space to practice, just repeat them. Get your mouth used to saying the words the way that the speakers the native speakers do. So if you never actually say words, if you're only taking in, if you're only listening and you're not actually producing the language, it's kind of hard to to practice and to really hone your pronunciation, to improve your pronunciation. So when you listen to native speakers, try to repeat after them. So for example, if you're studying English, you can try to repeat after this video. You can repeat after the things I'm saying because maybe I'm using an expression or I'm using a certain series of vocabulary words together, the way a native speaker would, and it's maybe a good idea to try to practice the ways that native speakers put their words together. So try to repeat after native speakers, especially when you're looking at media, and you can do this when you're reading books too. You can try to read out loud, interesting lines of books that you find or something that maybe is difficult for you. Very nice practice tip. Make a situation where you can't escape into your native language. Make a situation where you can't escape into your native language essentially means immerse yourself. Of course, going to that country or going to a place where you can speak only that language is very difficult for some of you. Totally understand. But if in your life, you can create a situation in your library, in your room, in your house, somewhere for just an hour, or I don't know, maybe a day, I don't know what your schedule is like, but if you can create a situation or create an environment where you have no choice, but to use that language, and you cannot escape, meaning you cannot go back to using your native language as a crutch. You can't use the native language at all. It forces you to use the language that you're studying. So of course, if you are lucky enough to live in the country or to live in a place where people speak the language you're studying, great, but you have to go out and interact with people. You have to put yourself in a place where you have no choice but to speak. It's very hard, and it's very scary, and it's very embarrassing at first. But if you take time to find places and to make environments that are comfortable for you, where you feel comfortable making mistakes and asking questions, it's very valuable for your learning process. This is actually something that I did totally. I totally did this. My Japanese wasn't very good for a long time, but then I started making friends who could not speak English. Actually, I just did this through finding hobbies. There was a hobby that I had. I joined a group. I joined actually a school to where I could learn how to do that hobby. And everything was taught only in Japanese, and the people in my class only spoke Japanese mostly. And then maybe we would go off for drinks and food. Late at night, or on the weekends, and everybody spoke only Japanese. And if I couldn't communicate even simply in Japanese, I had no hope of keeping that friendship together. So it forced me to study. It forced me to think about the words they were using, and to try to learn those words, those patterns, as well as how to produce them naturally myself. So I was learning the vocabulary words. The people around me were using, and learning how to apply them on my own. That was only possible because I had no escape in those situations. So try to do that even if you can do it yourself in your house. It's super helpful. I think watch TV and movies in your target language without subtitles. Tip number four is to watch TV and movies in your target language without subtitles. Without subtitles. So I think that watching with subtitles can be very beneficial. So if I'm watching something or if you want to watch something with subtitles on, great. But I sometimes find that I can in my case, I think too much about reading the subtitles, and I forget to listen. So maybe if you've seen a movie in your target language a few times with the subtitles on, try turning the subtitles off. And think about the characters body language, the words they're using, you can always look that up later, look up the words you don't know in a dictionary, but try to do it where you're focusing completely on the way that people are using their words, try not to use the subtitles. So kind of play around with it a little bit. If there's a word that's difficult for you to hear, you can actually turn on the subtitles in the native language of the movie as well. That's something that I've done. Like if I wanted to study Japanese, it's very useful when the actual words spoken in Japanese appear on the screen. Sometimes it's easier for me to catch a word if I see it visually and I hear it at the same time. So another way to kind of explore how you can use TV and movies is to actually turn on the closed captions, like the the the words on the screen in the native language of the movie. So this is sort of two points in one. So one watch movies without subtitles, meaning subtitles in your native language. And hint two is to watch movies with closed captioning on, but the closed captioning is in your target language, not in your native language. So you can try those two things with TV and with movies. Don't bring a dictionary to your lesson. Tip number five is don't bring a dictionary to your lesson. Okay, so give me a second here. So I understand the dictionaries. It was especially electronic dictionaries. We have them on our phones now are very, very convenient. Of course, it's important to use them and it's a great resource to have. However, one thing that really bothers me and that I think is detrimental. It's not helpful for students is when students are in a lesson and they're practicing conversation and they reach a point in the conversation where they don't know the word they want to use. They know it in their native language and they don't know how to say it in their target language. They pull out their dictionary. They say to the person listening to them, their practice partner in their lesson where they have a limited period of time just a moment. And then they look it up on their phone. It takes a few seconds the flow of the conversation stops and then they say a word. It's like, whoa, no, that's not, you don't have that ability. You don't have the ability to do that in a conversation with a native speaker. Most people, like if you go to a bank and try to open a bank account, are you really going to pull out your dictionary and sit there and try to communicate, you know, just a moment, just a moment. As you look up each word, you don't know. No, or if you do, that's not a real conversation. So instead, try using a different strategy. By that, I mean, if you find a word you don't know in conversation, explain the word to your conversation partner. Maybe they know the word. If you're speaking with a native speaker, this is a chance for them to teach you a word. I find that when people take the time to teach me a word, I remember the word much better than just looking it up on my dictionary. So try to resist. Maybe you can bring a dictionary to your lesson, but don't use it or try not to use it in your conversation practice. It's just, it destroys the flow of a conversation. So instead, practice the skill of describing the vocabulary word you want to use and learn how to ask the meaning of a word or learn how to ask for a vocabulary word from your partner. So you can use an expression, like, ah, what's the word that means? Puppa-bla, or, um, you know, it's this thing that does this and this and this. So this is an opportunity for you to describe characteristics of something or find a different way. You can use your body language. You can use whatever you have a lot of tools, but try not to use a dictionary in a conversation because it's not realistic. Train responses to common questions. Number six is a quick one. I think number six, hint number six, I have is just to train responses to common questions. Train responses to common questions. So for example, a very common question in English is, hey, how are you? You should know how to answer this question. Just have a default response. Hey, how are you? I'm good. If it takes you a long time to answer the question, hey, how are you? You need to practice. I think that's a pretty good, uh, a pretty good indicator. So for example, sometimes I ask students a question, like that they haven't quite gotten the idea of how to respond just yet. They, they, they're not so quick at responding. I say, uh, hey, how are you? And they say, yes. And then they think, and they go, I am, uh, I'm a good. That's a very common question. So think about just a default response that you can spit out that you can quickly say. If it's how is your weekend or hey, what's up? Or what do you want to do for dinner tonight? Think about like just a handful, meaning just a few responses to those questions and train them quickly. Just how are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm okay. How are you? Not bad. There's three. So it's just training responses to those questions. There's no reason to be surprised by a question, like how are you? Like that's a very common question. So for those common questions, train responses. So that we've got a bunch of videos, especially beginner level videos for some example responses you can do. So don't get stuck with these little questions. Just train a few responses. Practice a few responses till they feel natural to you. It'll save you time and it'll help the person asking the question to move forward in the conversation. Hey, study with materials that don't provide a translation. The next tip is to study with materials that don't provide a translation. So by this I mean, if you're using worksheets or some kind of textbook or whatever, and it has your target language, the language you're studying, and it has your native language next to it. While this can be useful, I feel that if you can studying your materials only in your target language and then simplify explanations for more detailed points. Also in your target language can be a little bit better. So I don't want to say like you should only study things in your target language and nothing from your native language because of course it can be helpful sometimes to look up a word or to understand a grammar point in your native language. But where possible, if you can find something that provides simplified explanations in your target language, it can be really, really helpful. Because again, you're thinking you're learning to think on like a simpler and a more basic level about the language you're studying in the language that you're studying. So this can be really, really good. So finding some materials to use where there's no translation. Maybe you can practice of course with with books and with written materials, but also with like video materials as well. So there are a variety of different ways that you can find materials in your target language in video and TV. So some things to think about there are the level of vocabulary words people are using in the media content you're watching. Who the media content is intended for? Children, young adults, adults, the speed at which the speaker is talking. So like I have the ability to change the level of difficulty of videos based on the rate of speech, the vocabulary words that I use and how many like idioms and things I use. So I could make a video very difficult. We could make a like a very difficult video series by leveling up our vocabulary. So by speaking very quickly or as you might see in like our English in three-minute series, we can also use very simple vocabulary and speak it a low rate of speech. So maybe right now this is a very intermediate level video. So please think about that. So not just for written materials, but also for your audio and visual materials. Think about who your audience is, the level of the material and so on. It can be really fun and it can be helpful to think about your target language in your target language. All right, we're almost done. Study phrases in addition to single vocabulary. The next tip is study phrases in addition to single vocabulary words. So yes, of course vocabulary is important, but I find it personally very, very useful to look at how a vocabulary word is used in a phrase because sometimes using it in a phrase helps you understand the nuance of that vocabulary word really, really well. So if I like a word like crazy, for example, in English, depending on the situation where the word crazy is used, it could mean something different. It could mean like a person who is mentally confused or mixed up. It could also mean something really good. It could mean something really bad. So if we look only at the word crazy, it's quite difficult to understand really the meaning of the word, but if you look at the way the word is used in a phrase, you can get a lot more information. So take a look at the way people use words in phrases, not just a single vocabulary words. You can learn a lot more that way, I think. Do your daily activities in English? Where possible? The next step is to do your daily activities in your target language. So if you're studying English, that means try to do some daily activities in English if possible. So this can be very, very boring stuff, but just think about it when you're doing the activity. So like right now, I'm filming a video for Englishclass101.com or I'm going to work. I'm cooking breakfast. I'm doing the laundry. What do I have to do tomorrow? So try thinking about your everyday life in English if you're studying English. Try thinking about your everyday activities that people that you meet. What are you doing? So this is a way to help you practice your verbs. So if you don't know, if you're, I don't know, you're doing something at work and you're like, oh my gosh, how do I explain the, what's the verb for, you know, a picture? Like I want to bubble up a picture. What's the word? You can check a dictionary at that point and go, oh, it's draw. I need to use the verb draw for draw a picture. So you can find these little gaps in your everyday life. These little gaps in your knowledge. If you think about your everyday activities in your target language, if you don't think about it in your target language, you might not realize you have vocabulary gaps or phrase gaps here and there. So this is a really good and kind of funny actually way to study. Use a learner dictionary for new words. The last tip is to use a learner's dictionary for new words. So in English, there are learners dictionaries available in English. So my favorite, my personal favorite is Maryam Webster. Maryam Webster is a fantastic dictionary resource. They're so interesting and they have tons of like historical information. I really do just sit and like read things on the dictionary, page lately. It's true. But of course there's a definition. There's a meaning for word. There are example sentences for words. But Maryam Webster also has what's called a learner's dictionary. If you find a word that you don't recognize, you can check it in a dictionary, in a learner's dictionary, and it gives you a simplified, a simple explanation, in simple English of that word. So instead of checking it in your native language, you can check it in your target language. So again, this helps you to understand the word that you are, that you're focused on. But you understand it from the language you're studying not from your native language. So using a learner's dictionary can be really really useful as well. All right, 10 ways to report speech. Let's go say. The first word is say, say as a verb. Say is a very neutral word. You can use to report someone's speech to explain something someone said in the past. So for example, he said the barbecue was canceled, which is a simple neutral report. Tell. The next verb is tell. Tell is used when one person is giving information to another to tell someone something they did not know before. Don't say tell me your phone number. That's weird. But like can you tell me where the station is? Can you tell me where to buy a hamburger? Can you tell me where to pick up my new car? Like, so giving someone information they don't know or on the other hand, explaining something one way to another person. So don't tell me what I can't do is a very good lost reference if you've ever watched lost. So tell another example sentence, my boss told me I was doing a good job. Speak. The next one is speak. Speak. So we use speak. When we're talking about language ability, like I speak English, I speak Japanese. We can use speak in the past tense to report something. But it usually sounds a little more formal. So like I spoke to my boss about or I spoke to my parents about or I spoke to my boyfriend or girlfriend about blah blah blah. That using speak instead of talked makes it sound a little bit more formal. So you can use speak, but it's going to sound polite. In his sentence, my colleague spoke with me about an upcoming project. Was like, okay, the next one, the next two actually are very, very casual expressions. So when you're speaking with friends and you're kind of talking about a quick, maybe somewhat emotional conversation, you will hear native speakers, especially Americans, perhaps this is unique somewhat to Americans. Use the phrase was like, I was like, he was like, she was like, this is a very casual way to report speech. And you'll hear it often very, very quickly together. So someone will say, I was like, what? And then she was like, no, and then I was like, yeah, that's the kind of pattern you'll hear it in very, very quick ways to report speech, but the subject changes. I was like, he was like, she was like, we were like, this is a way to share what happens quickly. Instead of I said he said she said, which might sound a little too formal, we can use I was like, he was like to do that instead. So this is a really fun one. And if you can use this, uh, naturally, I think that it'll really help you sound more natural too. So in his sentence, and then he was like, I love that movie. Was all the next one is also a similar to was like, we have the expression was all. So it was all, uh, don't worry about all, all does not have the meaning of the whole of something or a complete something. Instead, was all this set phrase is used to report speech. Usually, this one is used when there's some kind of emotional, uh, emotional aspect to your conversation. Or it's a little dramatic or maybe a little exciting. We use it the same way as was like in that very, very quick style of speaking. And then he was like, and I was all, and then she was like, and I was all, we use those together. But I was all has a little more emphasis. I feel I tend to use it when my, when I want to express a stronger emotion. And I was all no way, or I was all what? So you can use it for those very like surprised emotions or maybe angry emotions, was like and was all are both used in very casual situations. So in a sentence, and I was all, oh my god, me too. Talk. The next word is talk. So talk, similar to, uh, say, is a fairly neutral verb when reporting speech. You'll use it in a situation where someone is giving new information, to you. But maybe it's a two way conversation. So for example, we talked about blah, blah, blah, for a topic, or my boss talked to me about blah, blah, blah. So maybe new information is being exchanged, but the conversation is two way. There are multiple participants. With tell, it's like the nuance is sort of one person is reporting information, giving information, with talk to there's an exchange happening there. So keep in mind when you use the word talk, you will say either I talked to or I talked with someone, and then you'll usually have a topic. So I talked to my friend about blah, blah, blah. I talked to my friend about my new apartment. I talked to my boss about arrays. I talked to my boss. No, I talked to my dog about what dogs do. So there's some kind of, there's some kind of exchange happening there. You'll need to use two or with when you're referring to the person or entity you're talking to, and you'll use about to refer to the subject. So you can use this one, um, yeah, when you want to discuss exchanges of information. So in a sentence, she talked to me about my family. Let's go to the next one. The next one is mentioned. mentioned is used when something is just, there's just one small point in a conversation like just a little side note or maybe it's not the focus of a conversation, but just something someone says, quickly or there's just a little thing that you hear, oh, you mentioned something about blah, blah, blah, blah, or you mentioned that a new project like it's, it's maybe not the focus of the conversation, but something that you heard a little bit about. That's, that's when we use the verb mentioned. We can also use it in a statement, like, please mention any skills you have on a resume. So it's the nuance is sort of like a, like just a little bit of information is when we use mentioned. So in a sentence, our manager mentioned upcoming changes at the company to go on and on. Okay, the next expression is to go on and on. So to go on and on means just to talk for a very long time. So maybe have a co-worker or a friend or family member that just talks and does not stop talking. We say to go on and on, that's the expression we use. So in a sentence, the speaker at the seminar was going on and on about the topic. If you really want to emphasize it, you can say I was going on and on and on and on and on and on, not really emphasizes that the person continues to speak. So if you know somebody who does that a lot, you can use this expression to talk about them. According to the next expression here is according to, according to is used actually in the news or like to officially report something. So according to sources or according to the police, according to the government official, according to my teacher, according to my mother, these are like direct reports of information and their direct reports of information from a specific source. So according to the newspaper, my neighborhood has 50,000 amazing ramen shops. That's not true. But if I want to, instead of just saying, my neighborhood has 50,000 amazing ramen shops, I'm giving a source for that. So according to my newspaper, this is where I got the information. So this is important to use in news, in newspapers, in any kind of official documentation, you will see and hear according to these cases. In a sentence, according to a witness at the scene, the suspect escaped report. Great. So the next one is report. So report, similar to according to, we use report in more official situation. So to officially share information like to report to the police to report to your teacher to report to your boss. Sometimes it means to submit documentation like to give someone a written report. Sometimes it's to share information officially, just with your voice, to report news or to report an update. So when you want to give an official information, we'll use the verb report. So in a sentence, sources in the area report that the accident was not serious. Thank goodness. All right. Top 10 must no phrases for the restaurant. Let's get started. A table for three, please. A table for three, please. You tell them the number of people that you are total so that the host can bring you to an appropriate table. A table for two, please, a table for five, please. Could I please see a menu? Could I please see a menu? Usually menus are given to you as soon as you sit down at your table. But if that's not the case and you need to ask, this is a polite way to do it. Could I please see a menu? I'd like to try this dish. I'd like to try this dish. When looking at a menu, hopefully you'll find something you want to eat. I'd like to try this dish. Could you leave out the onions? Could you leave out the onions? If there's an ingredient in the dish that you're ordering, that you don't want, you can always ask the waiter if it could be prepared without that ingredient. So for example, I might say, could I get the burger but with no cheese? Could you pass the salt? Could you pass the salt? When you're at a restaurant, especially if you're at a big table with a lot of people, you might not always be able to reach things. So you would ask, could you pass me the salt? Could you pass me the ketchup? Could you pass me another napkin? waiter, waiter, a waiter is someone who takes your order and brings you food. In America and in many other Western countries, it's more polite to call a waiter to your table by simply saying, excuse me, or if you see another waiter walking by but it's not your waiter, you can always say, excuse me, if you see our waiter, could you please let them know to come to our table? Is there any dairy in this dish? Is there any dairy in this dish? This is something you would say if you have a dairy allergy, a dairy intolerance, or you just don't like dairy? You're asking the waiter about the ingredients in a particular dish. I do this all the time. Is there any cheese in this? No? Okay. And if there is an ingredient that you don't want, for example, onions, you could say, are there any onions in this? And the waiter might say yes. And if you don't want it, you could always request, could you leave out the onions? Could you prepare it without the onions, please? Can we get separate checks? Can we get separate checks? This is actually something that's very common especially in America. If you might go out with a group of friends or even if you're on a date, sometimes you might want to get separate checks. Pay for your own things. That way, you can all pay separately just for what you yourself ordered and you won't have to worry about owing each other money or calculating off a big huge bill. Are there any specials today? Are there any specials today? A special out of restaurant? Is a dish that isn't usually on the menu? It's something that's special, but it's a special that the chef is offering that day or that week or that month. So sometimes if you don't see what the specials are, you'd ask your waiter. Excuse me, are there any specials today? Could we have the bill please? Could we have the bill please? This is how you request that the check or the bill comes to your table. Can we get the check please? Could we get the bill please? You're asking this to your waiter who will then bring you the check and you can pay. Penn words that you can use at a bar. Let's go to buy a round. The first expression is to buy a round. To buy a round means to buy a round of drinks essentially. A round of drinks means one drink for everyone in your group, one drink for everyone in your party. By the way the word party is used to mean group at a bar or restaurant. The number of people in your party is the number of people in your group. So to buy a round means to buy a drink for everybody. In a sentence, our boss began the party by buying everyone around. In a different sentence, you're buying the next round. On the rocks, the next expression is on the rocks, on the rocks is a way to order a drink. When you say on the rocks, it means you're drink on ice only. So rocks are the ice in your glass. So you can imagine the ice, the pieces of ice in your glass, the ice cubes or an ice ball. These are like rocks. So saying I'd like whiskey. For example, on the rocks means just whiskey served over ice. That's what on the rocks mean. So in a sentence, I'd like a gin on the rocks. Straight up. The next expression is straight up. So a straight up drink is different from an on the rock drink. A straight up drink is chilled with ice, but it's strained. So there's no ice in the drink, but it has been chilled with ice. So a straight up drink, there's nothing else in the glass, but it is a chilled drink. In a sentence, I'd like a martini straight up. Some people use the word straight or straight up, but they mean neat, which is the next word we're going to talk about. So keep in mind straight or straight up means chilled. That's one of the key points here. So yeah, martini straight up is a chilled martini. Need. So the next expression is neat. To order a drink neat means the drink is not chilled and there is no ice. It's just the alcohol. It's just the liquor. There's nothing special about it. A neat drink is only the drink. That's it. Nothing happens to it. So in a sentence, I'd like a whiskey neat. Pint. Half-pint. The next expression is really two expressions. These are words you use when you order beer. They are pint and half-pint. Depending on the country that you live in, pint can be different size. They vary by a few milliliters depending on the country where you live in. A half-pint then is roughly half of the pint size. So a half-pint and a pint are two ways, two sizes we use to order beer. In a sentence, can I have a half-pint of this stout? Chaser. The next expression is chaser. So a chaser is something you use to follow an alcoholic drink. Chaser is often used after shots, so shots are small drinks that are usually kind of strong in alcohol content and they have a very strong taste. So some people like to have something after that. They call it a chaser. So the image is that the second drink is chasing the first drink into your body. You can think of it that way. The chaser is a non-alcoholic drink, so it could be water, it could be soda, it could be something like that juice, maybe. So chaser. In a sentence, shots of tequila are often followed with chacers. To be tipsy. The next word is to be tipsy. To be tipsy is a way to describe your feeling when you're drinking. So if you can imagine when you're standing straight up, when you're standing as regular, you're very confident and tall and you don't move very much. But if you feel tipsy, this comes from the verb to tip like this. So something tips to one side or another, think of your body in this way. So we use the word tipsy, the adjective tipsy, to describe this feeling. Maybe you're not so steady on your feet. You could tip over. At any time, that's called being tipsy from alcohol. Okay. So in a sentence, let's see, I'm a little tipsy. I need some water to be drunk. The next expression is to be drunk. So we talked about the word tipsy. So tipsy is a little bit like a little unsteady, but drunk is just a mess. You're just a disaster. You're being noisy, you're being loud. It's difficult to control your body or your friend's body, whatever. So drunk is usually seen as a negative thing. So yeah, so drunk expresses, yeah, it's just not pretty. Sometimes. So in a sentence, your friend is drunk. Let's take him home to call it a night. The next expression is to call it a night. To call it a night means to decide to finish at the bar, to go home. You're ready to be done. So here I'm going to call it. I'm going to say, this is tonight. Tonight is finished. So in a sentence, it's been a long evening. I'm going to call it a night.

The next word is deodorant. So deodorant is the product you might put on your body to prevent unpleasant smell. So usually it goes in this region. So this is called the arm pit. This region. So arm and then pit. So like yeah, kind of this k-vish area in your arm. We call the arm pit. But it's common to apply deodorant. Here you might put it in other areas on your body. But the goal is to prevent bad smells or to in some cases just stop sweating completely. So this is deodorant. Well deodorant actually if I'm going to be strict here, deodorant is used to stop unpleasant smells. Anti-perse-parent is used to prevent sweating. So perspiring comes from perspire. So to perspire means to sweat. Antimines not or stop. So an anti-perse-parent is an a product to make you stop sweating. So deodorant is the smell one. Anti-perse-parent is the sweat one.

And then, so is your transition phrase. So for example, oh my god. So I have to tell you about this movie I saw or, oh my god. So I saw my neighbor in the shopping mall this morning. Or, oh my god. So, did you see my new dog? It's kind of weird one. Usually it's about a person not about a dog, but who knows? You won't believe what happened to me the other day. The next expression is, you won't believe what happened to me the other day. You won't believe what happened to me the other day. Meaning something happened to you and you think it's going to be a surprise to the person listening to you? You won't believe what happened to me the other day. So it's a very fast phrase because it sounds like you want to share very quickly. Like you won't believe what happened to me. You can drop the other day if you want or you can say you won't believe what happened to me this morning. You won't believe what happened to me last night. You won't believe what happened to me this weekend. You won't believe what happened to me over my winter vacation so that you won't believe what happened to me gets very, very quick and short. So, example, you won't believe what happened to me the other day. I ran into my ex-boss, or you won't believe what happened to me the other day. I tripped and fell down a flight of stairs, or you won't believe what happened to me the other day. I got a new parrot. Sure, I don't know. Maybe one of you can use that. Guess what? The next phrase is very short. The next phrase is like an exclamation, so an excited statement and a question. Guess what? Guess what? So guess what? Is inviting the listener to guess what happened to you? Guess what? The full question would be guess what happened or guess what happened to me. But we only say guess what? So guess what? And sometimes the listener guesses and sometimes the what? Usually the listener just says what? So meaning you should continue the story. So if you say guess what? I quit my job or guess what? I saw my best friend with a new guy I haven't seen before. Another example? Guess what? I got a new car. Something like that. So some kind of shocking like difficult to guess situation. I haven't told you about this yet. The next expression is I haven't told you about this yet. I haven't told you about this yet. So have not becomes haven't. I haven't told you about this yet. So maybe you've told you have told other people, but this specific person maybe you have not told that person your news or some information yet. But this yet implies you are planning to or you want to tell them this. So it's kind of creates a little suspense. I haven't told you about this yet. So we could use this like I haven't told you about this yet. I'm going to France next summer or I haven't told you about this yet, but I broke up with my boyfriend last night. Or I haven't told you about this yet, but I'm throwing a big party for my co-worker this weekend. Can you come? Other examples? I haven't told you about this yet. I saw my boss out for dinner with someone who's not his wife. Oh my god, that's not true. That's not true. Or I haven't told you about this yet. I heard that the company is going to go bankrupt. Also not true. Okay, so those are some pretty juicy juicy gossip. That's an expression we use. We say juicy gossip is something that's like really, really interesting gossip or really interesting story about people we say juicy gossip for that. Have you heard about the next expression is have you heard about blah, blah, blah, blah? Have you heard about can be followed with a noun phrase? Have you heard about a person? You can use a person or have you heard about a situation. You can use both. You can use an object too. So have you heard about the new iPhone or have you heard about the new office policies? You can use that for pretty much anything you want to inform your listener about. So have you heard about is usually said very quickly. Have you heard about so the you becomes shortened to yeah. Have you heard about blah, blah, blah? So have you heard about the new secretary? Have you heard about our new boss? Have you heard about my co-worker quitting his job? Have you heard about the neighbors above us? They're moving. So you can use people here for a gossip expressions or you can use objects in this expression just to introduce something new. Very useful phrase. Have you heard about my mom? Sorry mom, I don't know why you came into that one. Okay. So the other day the next expression is kind of like the beginning to a story. So maybe this can be for gossip. Maybe it can just be like a story something interesting or maybe boring that happened to you. The expression is so the other day. So the other day, the other day, here means not today. Some other day, which day it doesn't really matter. It's not really important. But we say the other day, some day in the past, this expression is used for. So we can say so the other day, I was sitting at my desk in the office when my manager came and asked if he could speak to me. Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, or so the other day I was shopping in a random to my ex-boyfriend. Or so the other day I was renting a car and the former president of the United States came into the car rental shop. What? All right. So the other day, just some day in the past. So I was talking with and the next one you can use maybe for gossip sometimes, but also you can use for making plans. It's so I was talking with someone and blah blah blah. So I was talking with someone. Means you were having a conversation at another time with a person and you want to kind of report information or share something from that conversation with the person listening now. So I might say so I was talking with Risa and I think that we should plan a part of for this weekend. What do you think? So I was talking with my team about this and I think that we should make some changes. So that's a very kind of everyday work situation use of this phrase. But you can also use it for gossip. Like so I was talking to my best friend and I think I'm going to move. Or I was talking to my parents and I think it's best if we break up. Oh, so it can be for plans. It can be for gossip. It can be for just any conversation plus a report. What's up with? The next expression is kind of a little like mysterious. Then the expression is what's up with blah blah. Usually what's up with person for gossip? Meaning there's like the nuance here is there's some problem where it seems like something's wrong with this person. They're unhappy. They're sad. They're angry. Some kind of negative emotion. We use this. So it's like what's up with Stephens? I haven't heard from him lately. What's up with your brother? He seems really upset or what's up with your neighbor? Why is he so noisy? Or what's up with your boss? He's so strict. So it sounds like there's some problem. We usually use this intonation. What's up with what's up with? To introduce somebody who has a problem. We don't say what's up. It's not that. It's not that sort of hello expression. It's an expression for a problem. You can also use a noun phrase that is not a person here. What's up with this new office policy? Or what's up with this new rule at work? Or what's up with this new item on the menu at this restaurant? It's super weird. So what's up with blah blah blah has sort of a negative nuance. You can use it for people to talk about strange behavior. What's up with you? Have you heard from lately? The next expression is have you heard from blah blah lately? Have you heard from person lately? Have you heard from Stephens lately? I haven't seen him. Have you heard from your mom lately? Have you heard from your dad lately? Have you heard from your brother lately? Have you heard from your landlord lately? I don't know why you hear from your landlord. But have you heard from someone lately? There is sort of in a little bit of an expectation that you are in contact with the person involved in this sentence. Like you have some relationship. Maybe it's a family relationship, romantic relationship, professional relationship. There's some relationship with this person. And lately it's like have you heard from them recently? In the last few days and the last few weeks. So you can use this if for example you are looking for someone or you're worried about someone. You can use this here. You can also use it just to check in about some other person without asking that person directly. So like if I want to ask about using recent my example, Rises, our Japanese channel host, if I want to ask about how Risa is, but I don't want to ask Risa. I know maybe she's busy or I don't know for some reason I it's difficult to talk to her. I can ask like I co-worker. I can say, hey have you heard from Risa lately? It seems she's really busy or have you heard from someone so lately? It seems they're busy. So if I want to ask about another person, but I don't want to bother this person or that something makes it difficult. I can use have you heard from Boba Blah recently or lately to ask about a very useful phrase. I have to tell you about next expression. the next expression is I have to tell you about Boba Blah. I have to tell you so have to become have to. I have to tell you about has a nice, hmm if sound I have to tell you about, that. I have to tell you about my weekend. I have to tell you about Stephens, I have to tell you about my mom, I have to tell you about my my boyfriend, I should tell you about my girlfriend, whatever it is, some person used at the end of the sentence creates a nuance like there's exciting news about that person. Or I have to tell you about this thing that happened. You can use a situation at the end of the sentence too, but you're using I have to at the beginning of the sentence. So that sounds like really important. Like I feel it's so important. It's my responsibility to tell you because this is so exciting. Of course you can use this in more boring situations as well. Like I have to tell you about the new office policy. You can use it in that way with a very flat intonation, but for gossip purposes, I have to tell you about Bopopopop. It sounds really good. So what do you have to tell somebody about? I have to tell you about this new idea I have for a business, or I have to tell you about what happened to me last night. Okay, so there are these really exciting ways that we can introduce things that happen or that we can talk about people or whatever. Okay, 10 words for talking about space. Planet. The first word is planets. Planet. So planets are those really, really big things that we have in our solar system. Now there are officially eight because Pluto is no longer considered a planet. In my example sentence, Pluto used to be considered a planet. The next word is star star. So stars are those very, very bright objects that you can see in the sky sometimes at night. The closest star to us is the sun. The sun is a star, and we can see a lot of other stars if we look up into the night sky sometimes. In a sentence, it's hard to see stars from big cities. Solar system. The next expression is solar system. So solar system, in our case, here on planet Earth, refers to the system of planets and objects which are near our star. So our solar system now there are eight planets in our solar system used to be nine planets. Sorry, again, Pluto. Eight planets in our solar system. And then we can talk about other objects which may be enter our solar system like comets, for example, or a meteor or some other events might happen in space within our solar system. So our solar system is the area surrounding our sun and our planets that we know of. In a sentence, Mercury is part of our solar system. Comment. The next expression is comment. A comment is actually an icy body that is slightly melting and then releasing gases. So that's what produces that look a comment. Okay. In a sentence, comets are really cool. Meteor. All right. So yes, the next word is meteor or meteor or just meteor. So essentially, meteor is a different from comets because comets are made of ice. Meteors, however, are made of rock. So these are two different kinds of objects that can move around in space. In a sentence, lots of meteors burn up before they pass through the atmosphere. Meteor, right? The next word is meteor, right? Meteor, right. So this is an important distinction that many people don't know about actually. It strikes me crazy too. So a meteor is the space rock. It's in space or it's in the atmosphere. A meteor, right, however, is the rock. If the meteor makes it, if the meteor can pass through the Earth's atmosphere and fall to the surface of the Earth, that rock then is called a meteor, right? So in space, in the atmosphere, it's a meteor when it falls to Earth. It is a meteor, right? That becomes a meteor, right, when it hits the Earth. So fun facts. Okay. That's the difference between the two. In a sentence, have you ever seen a meteor, right? Supernova. Supernova, supernova. So the explosion of a star is a huge event. A supernova is the name of it. So the star explodes. And that's what we call it. It's called a supernova, a star explosion. In a sentence, supernovas must be incredible things. Black hole. All right, the next expression is black hole. Black hole, black holes are the subject of a lot of study. They have intense gravitational pull. So meaning they have very strong gravity. Black holes will pull other objects into them. It is said that like a time stops in a black hole or in like if you get too close to a black hole if you get too close to the event horizon of a black hole, you yourself will be pulled into that hole too. It's pretty crazy. So like the event horizon is the point in which there's no turning back from like you can't you can't escape essentially as a gravitational pull of a black hole once you're within the event horizon of that space. It's like crazy. You're done for. All this kind of stuff. So interesting. So in a sentence, black holes are mysterious. Galaxy. Okay. All right. So the next word is galaxy. Galaxy, before we talked about the expression solar system. So solar system is kind of our region of space. The region we're familiar with. But the next step up. So if you think of the solar system as kind of your neighborhood a little bit, you could think of maybe the galaxy as like your city or your country, maybe it's sort of the next step out. So a galaxy is made up of lots and lots of stars, maybe other planets, other solar system, many other solar systems in one galaxy. So I think yeah, we belong to the Milky Way galaxy, I believe. In a sentence, our galaxy is made of lots of different stars and planets. Earth. The next expression is Earth. Earth. Earth is our planet. Earth is the planet we live on. Earth is. Yeah, habitable. Meaning humans can live here. This word I included in this vocabulary list because it is a very good word to practice your pronunciation. It is the word Earth. Earth that are in the TH sound can be difficult to pronounce together. Earth. Earth. Earth. So this is a great word to use to practice your pronunciation. Earth. So in a sentence, our planet is called Earth. 10 words for talking about sleep. Let's go. To wake up. The first word is to wake up. To wake up is to open your eyes, probably in your bed or the place where you are sleeping. To wake up is to become conscious. To become awake every day you wake up, presumably, hopefully. In a sentence, I woke up three times last night to get up, to get out of bed. All right. The next word is to get up or to get out of bed. So that means to physically move your body from your bed out of bed. To stand up from your bed to get out of your bed. We say to get up or to get out of bed. In a sentence, I got up at eight o'clock this morning. To snooze. The next word is to snooze. So we have to snooze and alarm and also to snooze. So to snooze means to take a short sleep. To have a short sleeping time. Or to snooze and alarm is when your alarm goes off in the morning, you have a button, most alarm clocks have some button. You can press so the alarm will turn on again in like five or ten minutes or something. So to snooze and alarm is to ask your alarm to wake you up again a few minutes later. That's to snooze. So we have to snooze and alarm and to snooze, meaning like a short light sleep. It is a dance. I always snooze my alarm at least once. That is usually true. To over sleep. The next word is to over sleep. To over sleep means to sleep too much or to sleep late. Actually, no, it doesn't mean to sleep late. To sleep late means just to sleep until a late time in the day. Over sleep means sleeping beyond the time you wanted to get up. So for example, if my alarm is set for eight o'clock, but I wake up at nine o'clock, I over slept. I slept beyond my wake up time. So we can use over sleep to talk about times when you sleep too much. You sleep more than your body needs you to. So maybe your body needs depending on the person like six to nine hours or so. But if you sleep like 14 hours, we can say that's over sleeping. You're sleeping too much. That's the nuance here. And as I said, I over slept on my first day of work. NAP. The next word is NAP. NAP is a short sleep. So a NAP is maybe 30 minutes, one hour just a short sleep, a short rest. So a lot of people will take a NAP in the afternoon, for example, or maybe children actually take NAPs, for example, in preschool or when they're very, very young, they have an afternoon NAP, a short sleep. Like, yeah, just a like an hour or so, I imagine. In a sentence, I love NAPs. Actually, I do like NAPs. I don't like NAPs because when I take a NAP, it becomes a sleep. It's always like I wake up four hours later and I'm like, okay, well, I've destroyed my sleep schedule. Dream. The next word is dream. Dream. So dreams are those, those visions, those images you see, those X may be experiences. It seems like you have when you are asleep. In a sentence, I always have weird dreams. NAP. NAP. So the next word is NAP. NAP. NAP. NAP. NAP. Which means bad dream or scary dream, negative dream. So children may be have nightmares a lot. They wake up crying or they're really upset by nightmares, monsters, terrifying things happening and so on. And a sentence, do you ever have nightmares to go to bed? The next word is to go to bed. So before we talked about to get up or to get out of bed, this is the opposite. To go to bed means to get in your bed, to try to go to sleep, to go to bed. In a sentence, I usually go to bed fairly late to hit the hay, to hit the sack. The next expression is kind of a, I don't know, a slang expression. We have to hit the hay and to hit the sack. These both mean to go to bed. They both mean to try to fall asleep, but we just use them in more casual situations. The image here of hit the hay is with your body hitting hay, like laying down in hay. I believe historically because a hay was used to stuff things that people slept on. So that's why we have this expression to hit the hay with your body. Same thing for to hit the sack. So a sack full of something soft to sleep on is where this expression comes from. In a sentence, I think I'm going to hit the hay to fall asleep. The next expression, it is to fall asleep. To fall asleep, you're in bed and you finally, you lose consciousness. You stop being aware. You are asleep. In that moment, we say you fall asleep. In a sentence, it takes me a long time to fall asleep. All right. Want to speak real English from your first lesson?

The first word is definitely definitely is definitely a word that Americans over use. We use it to put emphasis at the end of a phrase to put emphasis at the end of a sentence. Party last week was so great. Yeah, definitely. Or to agree with somebody like that. Oh god. Literally. This in the last few days. I've seen the word literally so many times on the internet and used in just such stupid ways. The word literally means actually or truly something. This is literally the best hamburger I've ever eaten. So literally meaning truly or actually would mean that in that person's entire life that is the best hamburger they've ever eaten. However, it gets misused a lot in sentences. George Bush was literally supporting the war and Iraq or something like that. Taking a phrase like that literally would have to mean that the president, the former president would be physically supporting a war with his body. Onward. Onward. hilarious. hilarious is the next word. I like to use the word hilarious when something is actually funny. hilarious of course means something that is really funny. Super funny. It's a step above funny. Maybe two steps three steps. I don't know. However, people like to use this word in place of laughter. So for example, friends are talking. And instead of just laughing, the friend will say, that's hilarious. Well, if it's so hilarious, just laugh. Oh, this must be the last one. Because this is the worst one. This word is like I've probably said it several times already today for the purposes of this video. The word like is used as a filler word. So the same as something such as um or um or um for example, we use like as a filler word when we're trying to think of something. It's not uncommon to hear the word repeated like three, four, five times in a row when someone is thinking they'll say, oh, you know that party that I went to like like like do you know who is there? It just invades your speech sometimes when you're trying to think of something and no other filler words come out, but the word like does. Ah, this wasn't the last word. There is another one. Seriously. Seriously is used. Oh, it's good for any time you receive bad news. Well, not from your boss. It's a really casual word. But if you hear something um like your friend lost their job and you can sympathize with them or maybe empathize with them by saying seriously, oh, that's too bad. Or oh, tell me like all your problems. Oh my god, I just used like, oh good. Oh, I hate myself. Want to speed up your language learning? Take your very first lesson with us.
