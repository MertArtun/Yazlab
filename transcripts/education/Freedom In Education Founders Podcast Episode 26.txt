 Hi, welcome to the Freedom in Education Founders podcast. Our nonprofit organization was born out of frustration over what was and wasn't being taught in the classroom and how little parents and classroom teachers had to say about it. Together we can restore high quality education for all students so they can thrive and flourish as virtuous adults. We're glad you're joining us and hope we can offer some hope, encouragement, and most of all solutions to regarding the problems facing education in America today. I'm so excited about my guests today. Lindsay and I will let her pronounce her last name with Big Sky Life Books, talking about one of my very favorite topics. Lindsay is the former chief clerk for the Montana House of Representatives who served under three speakers of the house. She has 15 years experience in state politics. She's married and a homeschooling mother of three children and she is the founder of Big Sky Life Books, which is an online children's bookstore serving as a trusted resource of wholesome books for children. And I frequent her site often. Lindsay, welcome to the podcast and thank you so much for joining me today. Can you pronounce your last name for our audience? Thank you for having me. Yeah, Lindsay Brogandue. And that is Dutch. Dutch, okay. I think I knew that a while ago. So Lindsay and I actually met about a year and a half ago. We discovered this wonderful site that, well, I don't know if it's a good thing, I discovered it because I've been a frequent customer since then, but I am actually so thrilled that Big Sky Life Books is in existence. And why don't you share with the audience sort of how you made the move from 15 years in state politics to running this wholesome, beautiful online bookstore for children? Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Thank you so much for having me. Let's see. I think I had my first child and I went through a legislative session leaving him and just decided to step away from that and focus on my kids. Now we have three. And with the children came a lot more books and just the love of reading my kids. And I also married somebody who loves going to bookstores, used bookstores. We don't have very many new bookstores anymore. So we would go to these used bookstores and I was looking in the children's sections and you just saw all of these agendas being pushed specifically like Barnes & Noble and chapters. I know there are good books, Corduroy, Curious George, like all the great vintage favorites, but you couldn't find them. And it was it was kind of discouraging. So and I also talked to some elderly friends who wanted to buy books for their grandkids and they didn't have a bookstore to go thumb through them and you know, you shop online and you don't know what's what's beneath that cover. So I just I had a dream actually a couple of years ago and I just dreamt like, what if we had a room or an online store where everything was pre-read, everything was wholesome. People could trust anything in there. There was no agendas, no inappropriate content. And you could just judge a book by its cover. And if it looked pretty, you knew it was wholesome on the inside. And so I had this dream and I woke up and told my husband and he said, well, let's do it. Let's, you know, build an online children's bookstore and he's the tech behind all of it. So I mean, hundreds of hours have gone into it, but it's just been a joy. And people have a source they can go to that they can trust everything in there. And that's just been so fun to be able to provide that. Yeah, I've seen your videos of you packing these books and I just like it's weird. I just sit there and watch it because I just love watching like what book did they order? It really is in your room, your storehouse of the books is just amazing. So when we met about a year and a half ago, you were really kind of just getting off the ground. But I've watched your the the market for what you're you're selling just explode over the last year and a half. I know people who are so thankful for it and I've just watched it explode. So talk a little bit about when you first started and where you are today and how that's very different. Oh, my goodness. Yes. I remember when we launched the business and we had a friend over and we got that first shop of IDing. Oh, I got an order and it was my friend who was saying that that was our first customer, which is such a gift. And friends and family were so supportive. But I remember when it was the first order from someone I had never met. And now orders come through every day and it's so much fun to see what people have put picked out from our site. It's just it's really fun every time, you know, you get an order and oh, what did they choose? And you get to pack it up. But along the way, it has been a lot of work. You know, it is also hard to navigate Google and being able to rank. So if someone puts in wholesome books for children, we pop up. So my husband's worked really hard on that so that we have, you know, SEO worked out and we're showing up. And there's been so many people with platforms that have also shared about us to help spread the word. So I think that's been the biggest gift people that have, you know, been excited about it, like you all and shared about it. And that has just kind of spurred on the growth to where we are now. And so we I think we just celebrated two years, two years. So yeah, it's been a lot of work, but it's been a lot of fun. Now we order books from 50 might be more than 50 now, different publishers. So and I think we're around 800 books in our shop. We also started with collections. My biggest thing was I would see book bloggers, they would have like a Thanksgiving collection or a Christmas collection. And it was all wholesome. And I would click on it to buy it and it would take me to Amazon. And I was like, well, I don't I love this collection. I don't really want to support Amazon. So initially we started with just collections. I think we had about 45 collections. And then the demand was there to buy them individually. So we now offer the collection still because I love the ones we put together. But you can also order all of them individually as well. And no, I actually love your collections as a teacher. If you know, if you're focusing on one particular thing, well, I loved you had a patriotic collection. And so I was able to, you know, incorporate that into my classroom. But then some of your collections are about certain characteristics, you know, honesty, courage. I love the courage collection. That's so, you know, you have one on inventors and scientists. And so I think that that is remarkable and hope that teachers will take advantage of the fact that you have already put together collections that that they can feel very comfortable in ordering for their classroom, even if with all the millions of things that they have going on, they can put them on their shelves and not worry about, you know, what a student is going to open up and read and, you know, a parent being upset. So I really love the collections. And of course, if anybody is giving a gift for babies, you've got lots of great collections for babies, too. They're so much fun. Yeah, doing the character traits was really exciting for us. I don't know of another bookstore that sorts their books by character trait. And I think reading books on courage and perseverance and integrity and instilling those values as the child's reading about them. It was so important for us. And it has been a big hit with our with our audience as well. Yeah. And you have, you know, stories about real people. You know, many of your books are are nonfiction. And so they're real people who exemplified courage. And and then we were talking, you know, before about the scientists that you have on there. Granted, in one of the collections there, it's a mouse telling the story, but it's telling the true story of this real person who, you know, sort of followed their curiosity to to discover certain things that we are very thankful for today. So and then you you start when we first met, you were sort of catering to babies and younger children and then elementary. But since then, you've branched out. So you now have books that are like nine to 12 year olds, maybe middle school range. Can you talk about some of those? Yeah. And I do have several of those. I don't know. We were at 20, 20 chapter books on our site right now with more being added every month. But, you know, this one, Snow Treasure is just a hit from my childhood. It's a true story of courage. And I mean, I think it's for all ages. I did a read aloud with my young kids. But then if a child was reading it themselves, then you would get into the eight to 12 year old range. And then we just added this one, which I'm sure nobody will know about because it's so brand new. Sure, Hope is actually for ages 12 on up. And adults, I read this book. It was incredible. It was major crime, major laugh, faith in family and values are interwoven through the entire story. It is a fabulous book. So that one, age 12 and up, but it would be a great read if you read it with your kids, if you had mature 10 to 12 year olds as well. So, yeah. And of course, where the red burn grows is a great one for all ages. So we let's great until you get to the end. I know we have some vintage favorites. I really love, you know, the whole thing with this is we don't need to recreate the wheel. There are so many great wholesome books that are already written. So I want to just pull those in. Of course, we have a vintage collection on our site as well, but with chapter books as well. If we have a lot of the old great ones and then we have new ones that are being written as well that are fully wholesome, fully vetted and pre read and ready for ready for all kids. That's so reassuring for parents because, you know, as as their kids get older, I have four kids who were voracious readers throughout their entire. And, you know, at any given time, they could have four different huge chapter books. There was no way in the world that I could, you know, vet everything they were reading and know that it was all good and wholesome. So that is actually an incredible thing for parents to know that they can order books for their preteens or teens from your website. Eventually you'll have more and then and just trust that that they're, you know, not going to run into any contentious material in there that, you know, this shirt, some of the books are going to be sad. There might be books about war, that kind of thing, but we aren't going to be pushing an agenda in some of those books. So I was listening to a podcast last week and there was it was a podcast about classics. And they talked about the reason that they're classics is because they've been stress tested over time. And that's what makes them classics. And when I think about some of the books, like where the red fern grows or, you know, little house on the prairie even granted, those aren't maybe as stress tested over such a period of time. But they are like the if you present one of those books to someone today, you know, an adult today, they're going to fondly remember those books from their childhood and know that it was worth reading and they would read it again as an adult. I've probably read Charlotte's Web now a dozen times to different groups of students and every time I'm like, this is the best book ever. It just is. So, yeah, so I don't yeah, I'm like you. I don't we don't need to reinvent the wheel necessary. And there are stories worth reading and retelling to to children today and and letting them experience that. So that's that's really exciting that you're branching off into that. And I know you'll have your work cut out for you because it is harder to screen chapter books than it is picture books. I know we've had such a such a demand for it. People are clamoring for the chapter books. So, you know, we're also going to be releasing all the missionary biographies, Christian heroes, then and now those will be coming to our shop. So, yeah, a lot of them coming down the pipeline. So stay tuned. Yeah. So I don't want to put you on the spot, but I would love to know because we've gotten this question from parents, teachers, as well as school leaders about alternative book fair vendors. And I'm thinking about the books that you offer. You know, you have some faith based books, you have some secular books, you have some a little bit for everything. Do you see yourself somewhere down the road offering that as an option for schools? Wow, you know, I haven't asked. I haven't asked this question. And I think right now there are some good options. I haven't taken a deep dive into them, but I know there's a couple of good options for, you know, scholastic book fair alternatives for me to do that. It would, you know, you're buying massive quantities from the publisher in order to get a discount enough to do the book fair. So there's more logistics involved. You know, I have wanted to, you know, in the old days, when scholastic would have that thin paper booklet that you could, you know, circle what you wanted. I wanted to put all of our books in, I guess not all, but a lot of our books and one of those just so that people can flip through and see what we have. I just thought that'd be so much fun. So book fairs, I don't know. I think I would I would probably first do a deep dive into the ones that are doing it currently and see. But I also I have talked to a couple of schools to see how we can do an alternative. Maybe provide a source for the librarian to be purchasing books for their library, noting that everything is pre-read and vetted. So I think to start, we're working with some libraries to do that. We already have some libraries that purchase from us. So that might be our first step towards that book fair. I don't know. That's that's quite entertaining. Well, I'm planting a seed because I certainly would love to one day when I have grandchildren who go to a book fair, I would love for them to have those books there to buy. And you're talking about the school book fairs, right? Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. But I love that you are working with libraries and that they are refilling their shelves with with books from from you. One of the things so for our audience, maybe if you don't know, we have hosted a good book drive where we raised money and were able to send wholesome book bundles to classrooms all across the country. And we were able to raise about ten thousand dollars, which meant lots of books going into classrooms. The teachers were absolutely thrilled to receive these books. And one of the elementary schools that we sent a bundle to and we sent big Skylife books to them, I was told that this school was a book desert. And that really broke my heart because I'm thinking I bet every student probably has a Chromebook or an iPad that they're on, but they're they're missing out on books. And so I don't know if parents really understand how many really good books have been discarded. And I use that word on purpose because you can open up the flap of the book and see the word discard off of the shelves. And they've ushered in, you know, iPads or Chromebooks and have really tossed out. So I would encourage parents to recommend, you know, people like Big Skylife books as, you know, hey, we need to refill our shelves. Let's look to Big Skylife books and we can trust that they're going to be good wholesome books that, you know, we don't have to worry about any agendas being pushed or inappropriate material popping up that we didn't know was in there. So I hope parents and any teachers that are listening will know, you know, this is a good opportunity if they're needing to restock their empty bookshelves. But that was so much fun last year. We we sent so many book bundles all over the country. And that was such a gift for me to be able to send them and then for you all to raise the money to get them to the schools. That was incredible. And seeing the pictures also of them being delivered and the kids reading them. And, you know, it's also, you know, there might not be inappropriate content in our books, but there's also so much rich value in them. You know, when the kids are reading them, it's not just fluff. It's actually they're learning about great explorers or they're learning about courage and these character traits are automatically being instilled in these kids through these incredible stories that they'll just remember. And so I love I love that we're able to get our books through you all into the schools. It's fantastic. And we're we're planning on doing it again this year. And we are hoping to double the number of bundles that go out. So that's the goal. So if anybody's listening and wants to, you know, write us a check, just know that the money is going to good use and the teachers were so appreciative. We went to Denver, Colorado to a teacher summit this summer. And we actually got to meet a couple of the teachers who were recipients of the bundles. And they were just I mean, they were thanking me. I'm like, the books didn't come for me and the money didn't come for me. But you're very welcome because what a wonderful thing to send. So they were so appreciative. But it's funny that you say that these are wonderful books that that these students will remember, you know, the lessons that they learn in there. Because at that summit, we had a display of a wholesome book bundle from Big Sky Life Books. It was, you know, just one. And I think Poky Little Puppy was in there. Big and your fancy. There were there were a couple of just well, I think we had about five books up there. The reaction of the teachers coming to our table and seeing these books that they remembered from their childhood was priceless. And it's like, think about that. Think about how much these books mean to you today as a whole grown adult, some of them not that young. And think about how that's going to impact these children's day to read that. And those are the books that we need to be putting into the hands of children. And that's why I'm so glad that we partnered with Big Sky Life Books and are able to send books that that you're selling like that into these classrooms. It may be the only place that some of these children, you know, experienced these beautiful stories. So it's so true that we sent books to one city here in Montana through you all. And the students there, 99 percent of them are below the poverty line. And so they don't have a bookshelf full of, you know, amazing books at home. They don't even have food. They're not even getting lunch, dinner, breakfast at home. But we were able to through you all to send these books to their classrooms so that they're actually going to see these rich stories in the classroom at their school. So that was that was so neat to see the pictures of these kids just cherishing these books. And, you know, you talk about wanting to put all your books in a in a paper, like a scholastic thing, because that's how they did that. And and I think that putting the books in their hands, not saying, open up that app and read that book, but they get to they get to turn the page. They get to go back and look at that picture of the pokey little puppy that they want to see again. And they, you know, it's it's the whole experience is something that they'll remember forever. And so I love that that we're able to do that together. And again, maybe there's somebody in the audience just like really wanted to support this and it would be fantastic. So yeah, it's still isn't it still on your website, the link to donate. Yeah, I mean, find the link on our website, freedomanded.org. And of course, you know, we're here to talk about wonderful books with Big Sky Life Books. So you can visit Lindsay's website. It's bigskylifebooks.com. I'm pretty sure it's yeah. Thumbs up automatically for me when I. So. But it's it's fun to search through the collections. It's fun to sort of reminisce about those wonderful books. And then also you have a lot of books on there that I'm one of my favorite books that I got was Tiktok, Bannocker's Clock. Oh, sure. So that one tell the audience about that one, because that was one that was very new to me. And it introduced me to someone that I should have known about and didn't. Yeah, now it's been a while since I read it, but we sell a lot of that book and it's Bannocker. So, you know, he wants to build a clock and he has nothing. And so, you know, through the book, he uses whatever materials he has and he, you know, draws out what he would do and then carves it out. And it takes him years and then it doesn't work. So you've got like perseverance and, you know, someone who didn't quit until the very end. And he, you know, actually created himself. But I think that character traits in that book are, you know, patience because he was patient and the trial and error it took to really observe what he wanted to create. I think he borrowed a watch from someone and then just, you know, took it all apart and then was able to put it all back together and return it. But the perseverance and the observation, we have a character trait of observation observant. So that played a role. And so that was a really neat story, a true story. But inadvertently, you're instilling these great character traits in your kids through the reading of that book. Yeah. And just that curiosity too, you know, how does this clock work? Let me see that there's moving parts to it. Let's figure it out. So, yeah, so I am always learning new things from that. They're just sweet stories too. So what is the what's your best seller? Do you think? Well, let's see. Rags. We sell a lot of rags. The war dog. Oh, my goodness. We sell dozens and dozens of that one. That was I read that one to my class last year. Yes, I bought that one too, everyone. And they loved that, but they were a little sad about it. Yeah. We also sell a lot of the collection that you love, the Torben Coleman books. Einstein, Edison, Lindbergh and Molletown. Those ones, the illustrations are, you know, it's a big book and then the illustrations are full page. So you'll read a page of text and then you flip the page and it's just this big, beautiful illustration. So we sell a lot of those. There are several that are just they fly off the shelves. A lot of our courage books. A lot of our true stories that bring on courage. We sell a lot of those. And then vintage books, lots of little golden books, lots of Lyle Lyle crocodile inch by inch, like all the corduroy and Curious George and Katie No Pocket, all of those vintage books. We sell a lot of those as well. Because I think adults want the children in their lives to experience that. I think, you know, it's like, I remember this. I knew it was it was wonderful. I loved I remember how it made me feel when I was reading it. And I want you to know that story. And so, yeah, I think I've purchased a few of those. So that's good. Yeah, those worn copies and and I'm just grateful that they're still being published. Yes. I love that we can still get little golden books. And I'm always disappointed when I go to reorder and it says out of stock indefinitely. And now. Well, off of the podcast, I will share with you. I just found a site that will that will print out of print books if you send them suggestions. So I'll share that with you. Yeah, I love the chat about that. That's great. Yeah, that's pretty exciting. But well, I am so glad that we met somehow a year and a half ago. I can't even remember how we connected, but I'm so glad that we did. I'm so glad that you had this dream to create big Skylife books and that you married a book lover who bought into it with you. And you guys are doing this and and you're out in Montana. So I guess this is a good thing to do when it's cold and snowy and you can't leave your house. But I'm glad that the the mailman can get the books through and delivered to us. So I would just encourage everybody in our audience to visit big Skylife books website just peruse the collections, the books. If nothing else, you'll go down memory lane and remember those treasures that that you read that meant so much to you as a child. But, you know, I would encourage you to to donate to the Good Book Drive. We're we don't benefit from it that children all over the country do. And that's just tremendous to be able to offer them the gift of wholesome, beautiful books. And then if you have a child in your life or hope to have a child in your life soon, you know, start stocking up because it's never too soon. So yeah, and we're just grateful. We're so thankful that we're partnered with you all to get these books all over the country. It's just been such a gift because that was my goal. How do we get these wholesome books and schools and into the hands of kids? And you this partnership with Freedom and Education has done that. And it's just been such a joy to work with you all. So thank you so much. Absolutely. And then I hope that we can spread more of these books to more kids in the coming years. So it was a delight. Thank you so much for coming on our podcast today. Thanks, Beanie. Take care.
