 Welcome to the Consulting Technology podcast brought to you by Cognacor.com where we explore the intersection of technology, consulting and industry challenges. I'm your host, John Kerr, joined as always by our resident expert, Dr. Samuel Z. Today, we're excited to welcome Joseph Keller, a business advisor in the health insurance industry and a specialist in areas like value-based care, network analytics and claims analytics. Joseph is deeply passionate about making healthcare more accessible and affordable and we're thrilled to have him here to discuss AI and healthcare today. This is our conversation. Joseph, thank you for joining us today. Your background in software and data is impressive, especially with your focus on reducing healthcare costs and improving access to underserved communities. Can you tell us a little bit about what led you down this path in healthcare analytics, software development and altruism? Sure. Thanks, John. Thanks for having me. So I started out working for a provider and kind of getting the broad business background on how healthcare is sort of financed and what really drives strategies from a contracting perspective. And then when you get to see, when you work for a large system, you're going to get to see like like a much more broader point of view in the sense of you're not really focused on one small area. You kind of get to see like an entire state or how policy and things affect the entire country. And I've done everything from the commercial space to a little bit of the government stuff. So Medicare and Medicaid, most of what I've done is on the commercial side. And so from there, I realized that, you know, this is 10 years ago, I realized that compared to some of the tech hubs around the United States that healthcare was definitely, definitely in its infancy as far as tools, how they process things, the analytics, so on and so forth. And so since then, I've seen a lot more investment in creating little software shops within organizations. And so naturally, that was sort of something that I was interested in because, you know, one of the big challenges of healthcare is the administrative side of things, how many people you need to do, certain kinds of tasks. And it seemed inevitable that those things will converge, kind of like we've seen in software. When I first started in software, we used to have an entire team dedicated to like doing releases. And now they call that DevOps. People before used to not be full stack developers. So it seemed that that's kind of just the natural order of things that things will converge. And so I thought there was some interesting opportunity to be creative and create things from the ground up. So Joe, in particular, why do you think the healthcare industry has been slower than other industries to adopt, say, analytics? We know, obviously, AI, there's regulatory reasons and things like that around AI as well. But just as an industry, why do you think healthcare is generally slower to adopt emerging technologies and say other industries? I think so. The easiest thing to point to is electronic health records. It wasn't really a mandate until I think 08 or 09. So if you compare that to like banking or other industries that have been doing it since the 80s or 90s, it's just not really a part of the normal day to day when we're thinking about data and what is the data say. Health insurance companies, I think, have been doing it a little longer than, say, providers. And because they're just bigger, you know, when you're talking about a fortune 40 company, they're talking about millions and millions of providers where a big system in a state is not even anywhere near that. So electronic health records definitely have played a piece into it. And then just the skill set, right? I mean, as technology has emerged in the last 20, 25 years, the top talent doesn't think of how they want to go into healthcare. They think I want to go on Wall Street. I want to make Facebook or whatever. And so naturally, it's just kind of been slow. So those two things kind of converging electronic health records kind of still be in the beginning, the talent. And then probably just the data itself, you know, a lot of stuff, how claims get adjudicated, the data that's there, different systems, how they talk to each other. Historically speaking, you know, there's been a lot of those mergers and so claims engines and whatnot, they do things differently. And so there hasn't been an integration to look at a, you know, a billion dollar level company to kind of streamline that data. So the data is very messy, has a lot of gaps. And so it's very hard to do analytics. Not only that, with the regulation and just behavior, like you can predict much easier to say, like if you put an item on a shelf, more people are going to look at that. With healthcare, you don't know when people are going to be sick. So it's not as binary as like, like, like retail sales, or I like to use the analogy of a car, you know, like how do you know when your car is going to break down? It just breaks down when it breaks down. So healthcare is difficult in that sense that you're dealing with many different things that can happen in the body. And so from an analytics point of view, how do you relate that to some sort of economic strategy? It's just, it's just, it's just difficult. Would you say that, you know, the economics of it just being that, you know, it's not, we'll always, you look at historically at least areas like entertainment often get huge investments from venture capital and things like this, because in the short term, you know, there's no cap on how much money it can make, right? If you look at venture capital, even more recently, you know, for example, in the AI sector, the blockchain sector, often things like sports betting, gambling, video games, you know, the next Netflix streaming subscription provider, whatever that kind of next version of that is, those get heavy investment, those get, you know, lots of VCs investing into them, things like that. You don't usually see public good entities getting the same kind of investment or the same kind of attention from investors. Do you think just that the purely the economics of, say, healthcare drive that kind of slower adoption of emerging technologies? So your question is, do the economics create like a barrier for healthcare companies to adopt those technologies? Yeah, are there a lot of startup healthcare technologies, you know, in terms of sheer numbers, say, compared to video game or gambling or streaming or something like this, where it does seem like always there's another one of those kind of companies always being funded? I don't at least my knowledge, I don't see the same kind of growth in the healthcare space or these kind of other industries. Yeah, it's definitely a huge barrier to entry. And then if you think about some of the largest companies in the world, a lot of them are insurance companies. So how do you become like a Facebook and take on, you know, I think some of the bigger publicly traded companies are in the three to $500 billion in revenue. I guess it's not an easy thing to sort of disrupt. Whereas like creating a game or betting is more about how do you get eyeballs on something? Like so the economics are different and definitely more challenging from a healthcare point of view in terms of VC. So if I was a VC, I would, you know, maybe, yeah, that's a tough one. Maybe, yeah, maybe the economics are difficult. I don't know that space well enough. I know there's like companies out there now, they're there, they have their own investment side of things where they are investing in startups. So at the rate of new companies being started, maybe it's maybe it's just a smaller, smaller thing. Or there were much more low hanging fruit with video games in terms of the ROI. And now they're starting to maybe move on to something more interesting or difficult. In terms of AI in particular, is there any common or cultural fears you get when talking to leaders? In the healthcare space around AI? Is there any like either kind of cultural elements to it or kind of emotional elements that are that are where leaders, particularly in the healthcare space or the healthcare insurance space that are skeptical of AI or things like this? Or how are when you discuss this with leaders, how are they reacting? They're definitely very careful and very risk adverse because because of any data or anything AI related. It's impacting people. And so the laws that are surrounded around it, the hip of compliance and things like that. So they're very more careful about how they go about figuring out strategies. It's definitely baby steps because of all those constraints. In terms of the constraints that you're dealing with, you think that it's a more of a regulatory constraint, say for example, HIPAA? Or do you think that it's something different, maybe it's more of an economic constraint or a cultural constraint? If you had to kind of pick one, would you say, is it more of the fact that the government itself is forcing companies to move slower and they can't adopt AI because their data has to be de-identified or somehow protected because of HIPAA compliance and these other sorts of compliance? Or is it more of the issue of just the economics don't encourage the adoption of these emerging technologies? I wouldn't say the government necessarily creates, slows down the desire. There's definitely a huge desire. It's more like understanding the value proposition and does it actually increase in efficiency or lower the balance sheet? It has to make dollars and cents. And so to change that could be a huge operational risk because it could be slow. I like to point always back to the labor. Labor may be a little bit more adverse to changing how they want to do things. How is AI going to do it? So the adoption there can be tricky. And then it's just very expensive. Their provider's business model isn't in software development. They have a brick and mortar hospital or an office. And so to add software and AI into that is completely outside of their normal kind of skill set. For an insurance company, I think it's just a challenge to find the right talent in order to solve certain business problems. So the business problems can be tricky because the data isn't super intuitive to understand. Like everybody can understand how clicking and retail sales can work on the healthcare side of things. It can be challenging. And then from a doctor's point of view, I think there's a battle between old school and new school on adoptability. Where's the liability? If I'm a dermatologist and I'm using scans and a report from an AI tool, am I making the decision? Or is the doctor making the decision? Is the tool augmenting in helping them do that? And if so, how does that relate to dollars and cents? Is a doctor going to pay more for this tool? Not really. They went to medical school. Is the insurance company going to make money by providing this tool? Well, that means that they have to get a discount. The doctor's not going to take less money. So there may be a lot of good ideas. They just may not add up to some kind of dollars and cents at the end of the day. And so most of the tools that I see are operational efficiency, trying to figure out how to lower the drag of processing claims or internally, how to make sure things get routed to the right person. And so those are the low hanging fruits as of right now. I recently saw a thread on Reddit. They have a subreddit called AMA. It means ask me anything. And the team from ChatGPT joined sometime last week. And they did one for the big launch of ChatGPT4O. And frequently in the comments, whenever they were asked about the most impressive uses of the technology or the things that surprised them the most, they kept talking about AI's effects on the medical field and the things that people were doing with the GPT models and diagnosis or finding new connections. I think somebody who'd cured themselves of a rare illness by being able to diagnose themselves when the doctors hadn't noticed it. So I wondered if you had seen any interesting applications of AI in health care or health insurance that you'd like to share? On medicine itself, I think there's a lot more opportunity in terms of research, whether you're talking about cancers or assisting people in their own diagnoses, behavior, health, mental health. I think those are more interesting avenues. We did get Microsoft come in and show us how they're using it in some sort of medical research. And it seemed promising of some of the findings that they were able to do with the human eye. So with AI being able to kind of look at all kinds of different variables simultaneously, I mean, I think like Grandmaster chest people have like eight or ten variables in their head. And if so, with AI, you can throw that much more data and ask the GPT to kind of give some insight and then kind of tweak it. And so there were more things from the research side. I think pharmaceutical speaking that can definitely help out. And as processing gets cheaper, that what that translates to is cheaper drugs, lower costs for the consumer. And so I think there's a very clear economic formula there for medicine itself. Operationally, I think there's opportunity too, as I was mentioning about claims and making sure things get done quicker, paying correctly, that kind of thing. And then as far as the medicine, I know they're doing things with estimating when someone's likely going to have a heart attack. So maybe that helps the patient have a light bulb moment where they say, I need to change my behavior. I don't think that that will necessarily translate very easily to see like there's cost savings. So in the value based care space, they kind of look at things to say, hey doctors, if you diagnose, keep on track of people who have diabetes or these kinds of risks, this is more valuable. What that's supposed to do then is translate to lower costs and lower savings or more savings. The question is who's actually realizing those savings and what are we saying when we say the costs are going down? So from a doctor point of view, they're saying, hey, I did something more valuable, you should pay me more. Well, that's not really saving anybody any money if the doctor is having to get paid more. Me as a consumer, I have to pay more in a premium. And as a health plan, that means I'm going to have to charge more to my customers. So the tricky part is then is like, okay, where is the risk? Is the risk on the doctor? Because if their patients then seem to have more problems at some point, maybe one or two or three years down the road, do they get less money? Is it on the consumer side to say, hey, if you don't do these things, then we're going to price your health at a different premium? That's not really discussed widely, but that is sort of a consideration when designing products. And then from the health plan side of things, they're using it as more of a payment mechanism to sort of say like, hey, we'll increase your payments, but we're going to tie it as more of an incentive bonus. And so we're not going to guarantee the increase unless we see some certain kinds of results and outcomes and measuring. And so you have that component, and then you have the infrastructure behind the scenes. You have teams of 50 to 100 people sort of monitoring and developing reports and methodologies. And so you're like, where's the real savings coming from? So it's a challenge because it's not clear that you would have saved money had you done something else because that's more of a different reality that we measure against. So the savings, it's hard for an accountant to kind of look at where the savings hit the balance sheet. And so those are why value-based care has kind of faded, especially since COVID. Interesting. You know, many of our listeners are in the consulting space or they're in like a talent management space and things like this. In regards to the health care industry broadly, particularly for folks in the technology space, though, one of the growing sectors we're seeing a lot in the consulting space right now is like a data governance area or some kind of regulatory data analyst or regulatory data expert, things like this. Is that a particular area of growth you think in the health care industry is the job of the data governance expert or the legal data expert or something like that? You're just given the large amount of regulation in the health care space? I think governance would be more internally. You know, when you have large organizations, you need to figure out how you're going to sell something, how you're going to market something, how you're going to implement something and then the data strategy behind that. So the governance comes from more like when these requests are made. You know, do you have enough resources and capacity to, A, intake all those requests and then, B, to then figure out how to prioritize them? Because you can't spend... You only have so much money to spend, so you have to figure out ways of prioritizing that. And then from there, then once the implementation goes live, then you need to be able to track and monitor it. So believe it or not, there's just not a lot of infrastructure in place to even create sort of a... To create visibility into how the business is performing. I was asked one time, a long time ago about like if we had data to measure how effective requests were to join a product, something like that, something like a product or like did they join this thing? And I said, okay, yeah, did you guys send it out and have a way of like tracking and creating that data? And they were like, no, we just thought like based on the claims, you'd be able to tell me that. And I'm like, the claim doesn't have anything related to this flyer that you sent out. Right? And so like just thinking about how data is created to then measuring it on the back end, like that end to end thing is very sporadic depending upon the organization you talk about or have experience with. So these same consultants who are, say, looking to work with healthcare organizations, healthcare insurance organizations, groups like this or provide services to these kind of organizations, what are the primary skill set that these organizations are looking to get from their consultants or from their external third parties? Is it more technical skills? Is it more of the relationship building of a long term relationship? Is it legal skills? Where would you kind of put that the kind of skills are needed right now? I think it's more getting competitor data, trying to understand where they're positioned well and where they're not. So it could be, it could be, you know, like when you're talking about evaluating doctors or health systems, who is really high quality? What does that really mean? Can we be objective? Do we have a large enough sample to be pretty confident and to have results that we can measure against? A lot of times organizations can only look inward. So they can say based on what we have, that's not necessarily representative of the entire market or the geography that's being discussed. So there are a lot of companies out there that become data brokers essentially. And so they have to be very good and be able to sell their story a lot better by saying, we really are, we really do know what we're talking about. We have these certifications of quality, et cetera. Here's our methodology. And so that's a challenge internally because if you have a way of measuring things, someone externally comes out and says, we're better than that means like the stuff that I would be doing would kind of be inferior. Right. That's an incentive for folks to be like, to find holes in it, to not adopt it, those kinds of things. So that's the challenge for consultants and organizations to make those decisions. Interesting. Sure. So in terms of the fact that many healthcare organizations often either have a nonprofit bent to them or they're heavily regulated so they have some other kind of funding bent to them, things like this. Is there any particular adoption or ways to accelerate, say AI adoption in this space? Are you seeing nonprofits use any particular tools as the open source community providing anything for example, or is there a particular type of use case that you think that these government regulated sectors that are very dependent on say public funding or these nonprofit sectors should look at in terms of trying to adopt emerging technologies such as AI? From the government point of view, that's a little bit outside of my expertise. Maybe they could use it to figure out how they reimburse. Because government programs are funded based on taxes so they see a trend for services go up so they adjust the payments based on that. So that could be helpful in kind of figuring out are they spreading the money across the entire state or in cases of Medicare appropriately? Should they pass legislation to require more access and would there be a way of kind of figuring out if they could help folks that are retired or folks that are under the poverty level? So maybe those are the plays. I'm not really sure. I don't have much experience with that. So what sort of conversations are people having about AI around you at the moment? Is it still very novel or are they picking up the pace or complexity? What is the opinion of AI in the workplace? So I think it's, conversations are definitely accelerating and there is a heavy interest and a heavy investment in it. It might be a little short-sighted in the sense that, you know, I think ultimately what the play is for large organizations is to give people tools to either make them more productive so making sure that they're not wasting time doing other things that are otherwise unproductive. And also to not have to rely on as much on the labor talent. So if they can develop tools that can allow people to do things quicker and faster, then you know, more governance, jobs, other things would, other types of roles would be created to support those things, to support the business. And so I think that's really, that's how I only, that's the only way I see it really working is really tempering the liabilities on the balance sheet as far as labor. So one of the things I read a lot about is how generative AI can be adopted in regulated industries. And healthcare is usually one of the main ones we hear about. You know, in terms of say analysts, engineers, IT professionals who work in healthcare, work in healthcare analytics and healthcare insurance and things like this, do you think that these professionals will be able to adopt generative AI as part of their job anytime soon? Or you know, HIPAA is the number one thing I kind of hear about is that if they have a data set they'd like to analyze, but it's full of healthcare data, they can't just give this to an AI, right? And to say, Hey, I am an upload a data set and ask you questions about it, right? Or ask for, you know, recommendations in terms of either procedures or medical advice or things like that based on the data set you upload, just because the data sets themselves are often either not de-identified, they have a lot of sensitive private information in them. Do you see in the coming years that this problem will be solved or were you think that these kind of analysts, these engineers who work in the healthcare space, will they actually be able to use generative AI and actually give these systems patient data or at least patient related data at some point? I think they do already actually. It's more of a tool than a full automation to have it do things. And so, you know, whether it be on the claims side, making sure that things get routed correctly, finding, you know, like claims are complicated and not complicated. Like the idea is, is like, Oh, I see this, I should measure it against like what the expectation payment is and then pay it. Well, a lot of times, like things will be missing information that's needed or the claims engines will flag things. And so, who does that go to? How does it, how does the transaction back and forth with the, with the provider? How does that work? And so, the tools would be to kind of look at that operational process and make sure that the generative AI like knows where to send things, be able to explain very in plain simple English, like what the issue is. And so, I see generative AI being a being helpful in that sense of speeding up the claims turnaround, and then being able to articulate in either plain English or some way that's intuitive, not in order to make sure that that things are being processed correctly. Okay, thank you. And just before we wrap up the show, this is the moment where we get our crystal balls out and try to look forward into the future. I was wondering if you had any opinions or ideas about changes that you might anticipate over the next five years. Are there any indicators or signals about a specific direction things might be heading? As it relates to healthcare, you know, what would be, what would be amazing is if the transparency side of things, I think President Trump signed some legislation in there. I think it would be better for the consumer, not necessarily better for the business, if they were able to understand and have an expectation about what certain things would cost until you have a child, you know, you don't really know what your, how your product really works. And so it would be nice to have a tool to say like, Hey, based on this provider that I'm thinking about going to, how much would it cost me to have a baby based on my current deductible and, and all the things that are involved. And so I think that would be interesting to, for people to get more involved in understanding about like, I'm just curious, like maybe I should get a CT scan just to make sure like I'm almost 40 and maybe that's like a good thing. And then all of a sudden you're like, Oh, it's going to cost me $800. Maybe that's not really necessary. So I think from those points, if you're getting the customer more engaged would be the best thing. And I think Gen AI can simplify some of those, those hurdles. Fantastic. Thank you. And one final question. If you were asked by the healthcare companies or key stakeholders that were perhaps a bit reluctant to move towards AI and you had an opportunity to convince them or you had an opportunity to fight in its corner, what would you say to them? Say if you're, if you're adverse to change, it is coming, you know, I mean, the biggest companies out there, they see, they see the benefits and they're actively spending mega dollars to figure it out. And so you're either going to get smaller or get, or get bought if you don't adopt. This is a very interesting conversation. Thank you for speaking with today, Joe. You know, I think it's important to highlight the fact that the, the, some of the, the many examples we had here, there was a number of challenges just to kind of summarize and you know, the ones of the, can you actually prove proof of value, you know, to make it economically feasible, both for the providers, for the doctors themselves, for the claims, liability companies and things like this, insurance companies and so on. I think healthcare poses a particularly interesting environment for emerging technologies, just given the constraints. It's not a linear process of we improve the product, we get more return on our investment, like maybe some other industries are. It has this very, you know, multiple actors have staked in this and they don't necessarily have the same motivations, which I think is very interesting. And that poses a particular kind of challenge from a network effects standpoint on the adoption of emerging technologies. Yeah, that is, that is the challenge in this country, you know, insurance companies, providers and customers are all have very different motivations. And even across the same insurance companies, they have different motivations because they're positioned differently, same with providers. If you're very big, you're going to behave very differently than if you're very small. And even ones that are similar size. So just to get everybody to agree on simple things is a lot harder than people understand and realize. And unfortunately, you know, it is about dollars and cents. And to kind of go back to the car analogy, right? How do you, how do you keep car repairs as cheap as possible? Is the mechanic responsible for it? That's the doctor. Is the owner of the vehicle? How much respond? How responsible are they? And on top of that, you know, beyond just the car analogy, we're talking about people that have to deal with life and death situations. So it makes it very unique. And so the way the industry is kind of incentivized is to, you know, deal with the problems as they come instead of try to prevent that. And so how do you shift the economics from that kind of model to something else, given the complexities of the environment? So it just makes it, it makes it, uh, makes it interesting on a day to day basis. Thank you so much for sharing your insights with us today. Um, it's clear you're really passionate about your position on your LinkedIn page. It says working with a smile. Uh, I would love to give that a recommendation, a tick, definitely working with a smile. So I just wanted to express my gratitude for you joining us on the consulting technology podcast today. Thank you guys. It's been a pleasure. Um, and, uh, good luck with your future endeavors. Thank you very much, Joseph, for being here today. I think our listeners really appreciate the insight into adoption, emerging technologies in the healthcare space, and particularly the kind of critical issues it has regarding the different stakeholders and the different priorities they have. Um, so it's very interesting. I think to our listeners, both in the, should be in the business world, um, who are working for major companies, but also from a consulting standpoint, I think there's a lot of key issues here that consultants can definitely bring up. And that's going to deal with healthcare providers.
