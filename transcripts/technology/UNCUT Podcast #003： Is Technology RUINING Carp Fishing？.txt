 I haven't got a problem with it, as long as you don't come anywhere near me. Yeah. Probably one of the biggest things in the last ten years. Absolutely. It was absolute game changer. All the time. Part. It's just part of it. Mate, Dale, tell me about that. You never rap spot. Yeah. There's nothing I wouldn't say to Alie's face. Do you want to start by apologising for the sound on the last one? Well, Candid, are we rolling? Are we good, yeah? Yeah, OK, well, we will just apologise to everyone for the sound. Whose fault was it? It's Spooner's, because... No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, well... No, it was not. It was not my fault. I was talking to the mic, the whole thing. It was Wilksie, the man that was in charge of the sound. He's done it again. He's done it again. He wasn't in charge very well. That's whose fault it was. We're going to try our best not to ruin the sound this time. Here we are. And... We'll... Go on. No, I was just... We have got plans in place to slightly rejig the set up to make it visually more pleasing and a bit more comfortable looking. So hopefully with that, the new sound will be better anyway. Love it. Yeah, I think it'd be good. OK. But the good thing is everyone's really enjoying them. She's obviously great. Everyone seems to really like the concept. The uncut sort of just rawness of just chatting away and putting it all out there no matter what gets discussed. I think it's going to be a long live-em. Hopefully they can carry on and... Yeah, yeah, of course. It sounds good enough. More people might watch. Yeah. Well, we've got a... I think we're just going to touch on at the beginning some success that a couple of us have had recently, fishing. You just want to bring up your fishing, don't you? Yeah. No, no. No, I just said we would because I had a good fishing trip last week, one of our sponsored anglers, and Spooner's had a few carp in the last couple of weeks. So we can talk about that. But then we're also going to get into a question that's been sent in. Just the one question I'm hoping is going to be enough to last this podcast. It's a good question. It's quite a divisive question. I think it can spin off in loads of different directions. So I think perhaps we'll pass over to Spooner and just talk about what he's been up to last week or so. Talks for a couple of your carp. Yeah, nice couple of trips. It was up at Norton Disney with all of the salesmen from across Europe and the UK. It looked fun, that. It was fun. First time the European boys have been over to... A lot of them to catch their first ever English carp and to come and see the quarter-tales. Never been here before. Nice. Really nice timing for one of my bites. I'd done the night, the UK boys were turning up and literally they've all rocked up in me swim. I'm making multiple cups a day and I had me sense... Which is rare for you, mate. I don't think I've had a cup of tea off you this year. That's not true. You have got better. That's what's happened. I've always been good. You've been terrible. And now because you make the odd cup, you think you're terri earned. I turned the sensitivity down on my Dale Kim's load because through the night I had a couple of rats running into the bobbins. I was fishing quite slack lines. I knew that any beep on them was probably a fish on the end. As everyone's around, I couldn't see my rods, I had a single bleep and as I looked around the corner, bobbins off, tips just pulling down. Nice. Cool battle with a carp, done me multiple weed beds, but got it all the way back in. After what I thought was going to be one of those few little grow-ons that have got a 15 pound and it was so erratic the fight, I was convinced it was one of them. Turns out to be a 50. No. No, not yet. No, still hasn't happened, but it was a common of just over 39 pound. Nice. Really nice. And then a few hours later I had another bite. There you go. Cool, yeah, nice fish. Pettits is getting some big fishing now, isn't it? It's getting there. Do you know what? We worked it out the other day. There's about 180 to 200 carp and probably 100 of them are over 30 pound. That's quite insane. That's good. Yeah, and recently, in fact, the guy that moved in after me, he was on a bit of a social with a load of his mates. He had one bite right at the def, new complex record, 46-12. Wow. Physical shoulders. I saw the pictures. Am I right? It's also become, it does like a lot more bites now as well, doesn't it? All of used to be the one where I think it was quite hard. All of used to be people used to go out there and really struggle. It probably is for you, but I think most people... No, it all seems to be the one... No, it's the trickiest lake on the venue per acre. There's less carp in there than any others, but that's why you've got so many biggings in there now. Is that the biggest common in the lake? No. Again, about a couple of weeks before that one, it did its first 40-pound common. I think there's nine forties in there now. Is it really? There's a 43 common. It's a really, really special lake. I had another bite from there, like I said, a couple of hours later, and it was another 30-pounder. It's a good thing, actually, as well, that Dan's opening it up for a VIP fee. Yeah, he is. Is it 300 quid for the whole winter? Exactly. That's not bad. That's good. That is good. I've always thought that sort of thing is really appealing, because you've only got to do that with a mate or another mate, share the driving, go twice for a decent length session for four nights. It's worth its weight in gold just doing that, isn't it? They do it at Wolvenstowe as well, I think, at the winter tickets. And a few other places. They're worth it if you're going to stay fishing all winter, obviously. I think that'll give a lot of people the inspiration, though. You know, you've got, as long as you do nine nights through the winter, you've paid for your ticket and then you start to effectively make money, you know, you're earning out of it. And it allows you to get into tune with a lake. I think a lot of people, when they pop to a day ticket, like you're doing the odd trip, but if you decide you're going to spend your 300 quid, that's effectively your winter syndicate. Yeah. There'll be a lot more carport, and you know, catch yourself a big in an all-nighter. If the weather stays like this, it's going to be a good winter. That's insane, isn't it? Oh, my God, yeah. Insane. It's going to carry on. You know, you've got to be careful about the syndicate mentality. A water like that normally has got such a high turnover of people. You don't often see the same person twice. You end up with something where you end up probably exchanging a few numbers. You can sort of keep in the loop with a venue normally, you'd know nothing about until you rocked out there. Yeah, totally agree. That's quite good. Nice. Where was it you got after then? I went to like the YouTube, actually, been to. The guy we met at a carp show, a guy called Dean, basically Doug Alake in his back garden. I went and had a go on there. I didn't put much bait. I just fished solid bags of maggot with a few swads of maggot over the top and only had one bite, but again, at a real nice 36 for Scaly one. Look at that. Oh, yeah. That's nice, isn't it? We want to run of decent, not luck, but you're getting some good one. I'd say luck. I'd say luck. That would be a good reading. That is true. I've always said it. I'm going tomorrow night as well. I've got lots of fishing next week, so I'm hoping that little run can continue. You going back down there? No. No. He's got some nice fish in there, isn't he? He's got some really nice stuff in there. Yeah. It's one of those. Where are you going then? I've got two weeks, two weeks, two nights on Norfolk next week. So I did a friend of ours when Stomper passed away. We did a charity thing to raise a bit of money for his family. And one of the guys who was due to fish it last year, I think he got a new job and couldn't do it, so it's a rear-range trip. So we asked him on there for a cut of the nights. That's an old stomping ground as well, isn't it? Did you have a ticket on there? Yeah, yeah. I love the lake. And now there are two fish that have gone over 50 pounds, so they might be a repeat catch if I get lucky. But I will take it. Does that count? It counts for me. It counts for me. It counts for me. It counts for me. Yeah. You can't. You're going to be gutted though if the first 50 catches a recapture of something you've already caught three times. Surely that's a right gutter. I think the context of this room will be over them. I don't think gutting is the right word, catching a 50 pound. I'd prefer it to be a new fish. Yeah. There's one fish in there that I didn't catch and that's a zip linear at the minute. It's probably 43 pounds. Right. That's the dream to catch that one. Well, we'll cross the break before we come to it. Yeah. We'll see what happens. We'll see what happens. Coming in all pumped up. I've had it. Yeah. Repeat. May you be? Yeah, it doesn't really count. What about you, Rudy? Talk about your trip, mate. Yeah. So I've just been away, literally got back on Friday evening. Little trip over to Europe. Got in a habit the last sort of three or four years of doing a trip in the spring and a trip in the autumn. Went earlier on in the year with Josh that works here, Josh Dull. Had a really good trip and this time around I went with Oscar Thornton, one of our sponsored anglers. He can catch them. Oh, he can catch them. But I've not fished for infrages. We were on the same syndicate for a few years. I used to fish a bit together. Always said we do this. Haven't done it. But yeah, went over two different venues. First one didn't really work out very well. We blanked for a couple of nights. That one forgot to grow a wrist of his tail. Yeah, they're quite unique. The reservoir carp over there are unreal, like a proper box of chocolates. Every one of them is totally different. But yeah, that was from the second venue. So we turned up at this big sort of 300 acre reservoir. I didn't know hardly anything about it, to be honest. Not many people do that. Do they just drive out to France and try and find somewhere to fish? No. It's quite exciting. I haven't done it, actually. I'd quite like to do it. The thing is as well, you do these long journeys. We went from the second venue to this one. It's a four and a half hour drive and really the whole time you're thinking probably won't get on. It's quite annoying in itself. You think we're probably going to have to have a plan C after this. But we got there, managed to get in a really good area. What we thought was a good area. We tried a little bit of intel on where you want to be the time of year, but didn't really know anything about fishing. And it's called fishing. It was like fishing super long, sort of 350 plus meters. Long cast. Yeah, long cast. I didn't think I could still do it. That's a couple of casts. Yeah, so it was all boat work. And the fishing was just incredible from the off, really. So much so that we started getting worried about kit and batteries when the action started. Because you go away. You always take enough, you know, be prepared, take enough leads, hooks, bait and all the rest of it. But when it really goes off, preparing for that is like obviously impossible. So we ended up putting rods out, sort of together. We'd go out in the boat. All the spots were GPS. We had four different spots, fishing four rods each. And we would just go out to each individual spot, get above it. I'd pass Glossary's rod. I'd have my one. We'd lower the rods off. Then I'd take both of the rods, hold them out to the side like a cut of swords. And then we'd trundle back to the bank. Coys, coal. Yeah, mate. It's a nice carp. Like really nice. Some of them are grey. Some of them are really like peachy looking. Like I said, they're just unique. And it can be 25 pound or 65 pound. How many did you catch it? We reckon. We couldn't really work it out. It got so crazy. I think I was saying to you this morning. We ended up putting back like really nice looking 30 pounders. Just having a quick look in the net and putting them back and sitting back after thinking, this is mad fishing. We shouldn't be doing this. We should be getting these out in a nice photo with them all. But it was so crazy. I think we had about 55 carp in four days. Which is just a relentless action. I did five packs of Crank-X hooks. Thank God I took enough with me. But yeah, unbelievable fishing. Just explain what you do for permits. And how much does it cost in that? Yeah, so you have to get like a carte-tepêche license, which is a bit like our rod license here, I guess. Which covers you for where you have to choose the region. And you just get like a week permit. You can get a week or you can get a year. It's not expensive for a year permit. No, I don't think it is. I don't know how much it is for a year. It's time I do it because I'm only doing it in those small windows. I never think I'm going to go back that year. I think it's about 200 something euros. Is it? Because I'm getting one for us for next year. Yeah, I think I paid about 46 euros, which will cover me for probably about five weeks or something. I don't know. Right, OK. So as long as you've got that, and these lakes are public and not syndicates, you can literally rock up, chance your arm. And you can get that online, can you? You can get that online. You just go online, carte-tepêche, and it will come up. And then you can translate into English. Obviously do some research on where you think you might be going. If you're going total opposite end of the spectrum, you probably have to check, make sure you get the right license for the right region. I think that's the case anyway. I'm pretty sure it is. You didn't get a license to get a license. You know, driving others. You don't always see anybody. So he was a bit of a joke driving home. Because Oscar already had his, because he bought a year one from when he went earlier in the year. He went, that was a waste of 46 euros, wasn't it? It was really. But you have to have it. Yeah, of course you do. Obviously. You've got to check with these places. You're allowed to night fish. A lot of these places have really small, dedicated night zones. So you go there. You feel, oh, yeah, I'm in the prime swim, get set up. If you haven't done your research, you quickly find out that you can't do the night. Then you're fishing days only in an area where all the bikes are coming at night. And the French on dames don't take you too well. No, I mean, you hear all the horror stories. I've had some horrible things happen in the past. It isn't for the faint-hearted, really. You've got every wits about you. I don't think I'd be that comfortable going on my own. A lot of people do. So they're not trying their own. That adventure with when you get to share it with someone else, it means a lot more, I think. I think even boat work on your own when you're not fluent in the boat, as well as a bit that is... You need to be doing it with your mate, really. Yeah, and when you're not doing it for ages, we're saying, as you probably find as well, and you guys, when you do the monster cups, you start off, don't you, a little bit like finding your feet a little bit. But the time you go home, you're as good as anybody, and then you forget it all. You go back and forth. It's waiting for something. I keep looking at it in a minute. Yeah. In a minute. El plate. Yeah, eight years, still not that good in a boat, really. Very good. Even by the end of the trip, it's still like that. I think whatever R you want, I know Dan doesn't really like boat fishing that much either. I was talking to him about it. He doesn't really like it that much. Really? No. I love it. Yeah, I do. I absolutely love it. It's the way I'd like to fish, but I must admit, when we got sort of two and a half days into that, I was thinking, old boat would half be nice when you're towing out that long. Back and forth, back and forth. Yeah, we've had it a few times in Hungary. You're normally not allowed to use big boats there. We certainly weren't on the lakes we were fishing. Yeah, like Hatvan. Yeah. And you're fishing out long way. How far out were we fishing? 160 or something? No, 120, I think. 120. Yeah. And you can catch so many more of a boat. That is the only time, really, a boat, but I think it's okay when you're allowed to use them. It's boring though, isn't it? It is, but especially in the same situation you're having there, it was like we're catching loads of, you're not catching little ones, but we're catching even smaller fish than the ones you were catching. If you're doing that in a proper boat and it takes you a long time to go back out, you do get no sleep. Yeah. So it is easier with one of them. It's the kit as well you need. Obviously with two of you, take two of you, take two lots of kits. Obviously I think we took six leisure batteries and the two boats and all the rest of it. But if you didn't have all that stuff, you just thought, I'm going to chuck a leisure battery on board on my boat and I'm going to get, you literally get caught out within a day and a half and you trip through it. You have so much stuff. Even when I go each time now, there's always a great big list on my phone when I come home. Definitely need more of them. Need another one of them. Yeah. You should just... We need a spare boat. A spare boat. A spare boat, 100% you do. Yeah, there's no point going on them trips without a spare engine, spare boat, repair kit, spare leisure batteries. Damien, who's one of our sponsored anglers in France that helps us out massively on our trips, he's an amazing boat. God's really, really good boat angler. Yeah. And he does a lot of them long trips. He works sort of six months of the year as a chef in his restaurant and then has the rest of the year off and fishes all the time. So you can imagine how good he is in them sort of scenarios. And he takes, because he does them really long trips, he'll take... It's like a fold out solar panel that's probably the size of this table. And I think it's like a day charge for one of his batteries. Well, obviously if you have that on rotation, you're in good stead all the time. So I think we're probably going to get some of them for our trips in the future because it's easier for us because we've got a crew and we've often got like a little jeep or something around the corner at the crew of Stain and they can charge the stuff up for us. But if you are out there on your Todd, that is well handy to be able to charge stuff up. Yeah. But yeah, certainly some fishing I love doing. I think the fact that you don't know everything, like nowadays I think it'll probably segue into what we're going to talk about later, but that European fishing, the mystery is just still 100% there the whole time you're there because you don't really know anything. So your next bite could be 55 pounds. You don't know any of the carp. I've had a few 70s using boat work really. How many of them are you at? About one. There you go. That didn't work out, did it? Yeah, not a good one. A few. A few. How was you catching them then? So exactly the same as our fish here. No doubt about it. The only thing I stepped up was my hook to an X. I normally use standard crank. Yeah. I was using crank hexes in a size four. Oh, there you go. That's how I was catching them. So I'm going to go with a hook. I'm going to go with a hook. I'm going to go with a hook. I'm going to go with a hook. I'm going to go with a hook. I'm going to go with a hook. I'm going to go with a hook. Yeah. I was using crank hexes in a size four. Oh, there you go. That's how I was catching them. So traditional spinner rig. The only thing I was doing slightly different because everything we caught was on double 20mm bottom baits. Right. There's a lot of busts on chat and if anyone don't know, they are the little tiny catfish and a few nuisance craze and stuff. This time of year we've gone not normally too bad for those, but because of that we were using big baits. The only thing I did slightly different, I've been using the, I know you did, I've used double hook bead quite a lot when I'm using Ronny's and Woff-ters, but I just pulled the bead right down to where the shrink tube ends. So there was just some travel there. In my mind it was just, it's a huge bait. I just wanted to sort of be able to get out of the way as soon as the caught swallowed it. Can you not just use a longer bit of shrink tube there though? No, because that's on a swivel, isn't it? Well, does that go over the shrink tube? Well, you could, but I'd be worried about the hook ring swivel being able to pass over that thing. Oh, right. Okay. It's locking on. Yeah. I mean, a doubt you could. Nothing he does. Nothing he does in his mind really. See, that's, I would lose them like that. You said that. I genuinely, I've fished a lot like that before out on them big lakes and I've lost them and you lost one out of 30 bites or whatever. Yeah. And I use a similar rig in, I went to a place like a commercial water called Teleats a couple of years back, a few years back actually, and use that exact presentation there as well. They had like 27 bites landed all of them. That's what I meant. That exact presentation. Rigs are strange. I swear they're like person to person. They can, you could like that. Dimo could give me one of these rigs and I'd lose it on it. Yeah. And it then he'd lad 10 out of 10. Yeah. Yeah. He's mad. You play your carp generally a lot harder than most people I've seen though. Depends. If I'm catching lots I do. Yeah. Get them in. Get them back out. Get them back out. Yeah. I'll do it. Do you think I'll plan that hard? Yeah. Yeah. It's like they are white capes. You couldn't learn the carp on a white cape. No. I mean that's when I first joined and I was like screwing because I kept losing fish on them and like him and Dan are just landing like everything they hook on them. It's just, it's your preference. I think what it does do though like catching all of them on them on them big double bottom baits. That's something I never do here now. Like years ago when I first started fishing it was all snowman's or two. I know Dimo does loads of that fishing and I think I've seen him doing that quite a lot and you feel I'm going to try it and you don't. And then you go there and get forced to because of nuisance fishing stuff. Get all them results. You think how am I doing that? Why aren't I doing that? I always think that when we're, I'll never stop doing using high visual hook baits because it works so well. But I do have quite a few dilemmas at times when I've cast out like a little yellow 15 mil on a spinner and then I sit there and put a kilo and a half of something the opposite color of the phone stick and then I sit down on a chair and think I've literally, I'm almost going, I don't really want to catch one and three more of them and avoid that yellow beacon. But we know they come in sometimes and just single that out. I think most of the time it works out that you catch more like it but sometimes it does work against you. Yeah, for sure. But it's figuring out when that is in it, that's the thing. Yeah, it's whatever your confidence with, isn't it? I think the standard bottom bait, you hardly ever see anybody using it and you never see somebody with two bottom baits on their hair. It works when you're changing sometimes. There's buoyancy in everybody's hook baits. Fishes get used to seeing it, don't they? Right, shall we get into this question? Chuck it up. I was sent to Spooner privately on Facebook, which I thought was a really good question and basically with how far technology has come over the last 10 years with rig mechanics and I think we'll explore this wider, like where could it be in the next 10 years? I think it's a really good question. I think we can spin off technology in loads of different ways. It doesn't have to necessarily be rig mechanics, hooks, swivels, leads. I think it can be social media, God knows what else, the internet, just the fact the information's out there. Just briefly mentioned this to Daemo this morning. He wasn't that convinced it's actually come that far, was he, Daemo? I don't think it has really. If I go back to when I was 19, 20, we were fishing like the sort of, I mean, I'm 53 this week, so that's a long time, that's 33 years. That's a good memory. You're a cheeky bastard. The biggest significant change in tackle at that point was we were using like 11 foot two pounds, 12 foot two pounds, two and a quarters, long range fishing, you just stepped up to a two and a half. You wouldn't go barbell fishing with them lots of now. We were fishing little weedy lakes where the cart were getting away because you just didn't have the power in the tackle to get them in. We were fishing with like Cardinal 55s and that sort of thing, very small rods and reels compared to what was available today. The most significant advance I think in fishing rods at that point would have been about, that was 91, so 91, 92, 91, 92, Dawa come out with the amorphous fishing rod. That absolutely changed the game. You could hook up, we could hook up in the same lake and they couldn't get in the weed and we could pull them in with the weed and it was absolute game changer. We had SS 3000s came out. I was really fortunate that I'd been using Dawa gear for a long time prior to that. Knew the guy who became the MD Dawa, so I got one of the very first sets of amorphous and the SS 3000s. They were completely different. When was the SS then? About 91. 91? Right. 91. They're still doing that real now. You're talking about, I think the amorphous was the biggest change and then from that point onwards everybody else caught up. Fishing rods have improved because materials have improved, fishing lines have improved, but I'm fishing at the moment with our three pounders which are probably not too dissimilar to the amorphous. Yeah. Because if you've got a two and three quarter now, you'd probably float a fish with it. Yeah. Then it was like the ultimate long range rod, but I'm using SS 3000s. I'm using SS 3000s. I'm using our three pounders on this little lake. I'm actually using some of my old tackle that I use. I've got bank sticks from 20 years ago with Steve Neville just because I collect tackle and I've been using it just for the last thousand years. Yeah, it's nice. Actually, it's the same gear that I was using 30 years ago. Things haven't moved on that far. You've got a much sharper hook on now though, do you think? No, because I used to sharpen more hooks then. I think to the masses though, I'd agree. Like you said, if people aren't sharpening their hooks and I think the ease of rig mechanics now, if we look at something like, you'd say in the last 10 years, the spinner rig is something that's come about, isn't it, in the last 10 years? That really is a tie a couple of times and you're an absolute expert at tying it. You have not got to have any brain power. It's convenience. It's convenience. It's easy. You can change the hook. And you're presented nine times out of 10. That's the key, isn't it? But my rigs going back to when I was 19 was a helicopter rig, which was two beads pulled on a bit of tubing with a swivel in it. All right, it didn't drop the lead and it was probably not the safest rig in the world, but it was never tangled and I had a really sharp hook on because I sharpened it myself because hooks were shit, absolute shit. And I had to sharpen it with the lead and doors and mustard hooks. They were terrible. So in that perspective, you've got hooks that are readily available to everybody that are really sharp. But actually, I think I could use the same gear now and catch what I'm catching. But I think we should do a match, shouldn't we? I think there's a big caveat there though, Damir. You were doing that 30 years ago. You were sharpening hooks and you were fishing a heli setup that you knew was presented. How many people around you were doing the same sort of thing and having the same sort of results? I don't know if they were group they were, but you end up being the product developers of the company. That's the stress that's been. That's sort of like the point though, isn't it? Like you said, you had that little group of people doing it, doing it right and you'd argue we could probably sit around this table and name all those people individually that stand out that we're doing it right. Now everything is just available to absolutely everybody. So everybody can be a, as far as rig mechanics and stuff go, everyone can be a Damian Clark, everyone can be a Terri-Ern because it's just all there ready made to just chuck on, cast out and then obviously the watercraft and the fig starts coming into it then. But as far as the actual rig side of things go, being available to absolutely everyone in the last 10 years is something that's really prevalent. But bait hasn't really moved on either really. Is it like tigers, sweet corn, protein boilies? Yeah, it's all the same. It all comes around in a circle. I think the wider discussion is probably in 10 years time. And actually you're talking about 30 years ago. 30 years ago. Yeah, not even 10 years ago. 10 years ago, we were using the spinner. Do you think? No, not quite. No, not far off. No, I reckon it was 8 years ago. It's before we moved in here. Yeah, but it's definitely not as wide as it is. It must be the last five years that it's gone berserk and it last five, six years. Yeah, we had probably tied ones and all the rest of it is definitely last five, six years. But I think when we brought out the spinner swivel, which was Thomas' idea, and Dan put it on whatever DVD it was. No, no, I did a monster cast of it. It went mental, didn't it? Yeah. Because we were air shipping in Boem, weren't we? Boem, yeah. I think we sold 18 months worth in about three weeks. Something unbelievable. Everyone wanted to use that rig. Do you get a bonus out of that? Yeah, probably. But still do. Like you said, that is, if you walk around a day ticket like now or a syndicate like, you could maybe not everyone, but a large percentage of people will have spinner rigs out. Do you know, I think one of my biggest things, if you label technology wider than the actual N-TAC on the products itself, I would say the information available to people now is probably one of the biggest things in the last 10 years. Absolutely. Because 10 years ago, Instagram, Facebook, and it were quite infancy, weren't they? Not everybody was on them. Maybe Facebook, they were. Maybe, yeah. Maybe Instagram's newer. Facebook's probably 20 years old now. But Cartfishing going on it, how big is it now? It's enormous now, isn't it, on social media. And the information now, to any lake pretty much, if you're a member of somewhere or you go to a group of lakes or something, you can find out everything that's going on there. I just opened up your mobile phone. So years ago, when like... Oh, mate, years ago, it was like, get the Angling Times. Giving an example, I remember getting... My dad used to buy me the Angling Times every week. It's like, you know, that's the only sort of bit of information or anything to read, if you like, every week. And there was a picture of this lad on the back, and I recognized him. And it was a £28 very cool. And I thought, I know where that is. I was 14. Yeah. Never been night fishing. I want to join there. I'm going to go down there. Yeah. And I joined it. I caught that fish before the next Angling Times. Of course you did. Yeah, of course you did. We expected that. But that was all there was. It was, you know, in word of mouth, everything was really... What fish was it though, mate? Pigeon at the garrison. Oh, was it? Yeah, I do miss that. Like magazines, I remember you used to go fishing places and that, and you would think... You'd know a certain fish was in there. Like, if I go back X amount of years, it might be like a £25 mirror or something. And you think, oh, I'm going to catch it this weekend. I'm going to go and do Friday night Saturday. And then you're going to pick up carp talk or something like that. And you go, no! It's big fish now! But like now you'd know in like the same day, wouldn't you? Yeah. Pretty much goes up or someone would come in the office and say, you know, to fully scale one come out of such and such, you go, oh, you're joking. I was going to go that weekend and you hope you find there it is. And you know. So that is like... That's real double edged, innit? It sped everything up. Yeah, I think it's amazing that people can get that information. So like if they want to, like they might find out, for example, a lake's fishing really well and it'll make them go. They've got stuff at this go at the weekend, it's fishing really well. And at the same time that you've lost that sort of not really knowing and rocking up and finding out what's going to happen for yourself, you sort of, everything's done for you a little bit, isn't it? Yeah. I still don't think you truly know them until you get there, do you? You get there and fish it. Yeah, that's just what I was going to say. It doesn't matter. You still feel excited when you drive through the gate and you still cast out, not knowing whether you're going to get one or not. Yeah, not. That's why we all do it, innit? Yeah. Yeah, I just, it's just whether or not that, that social media thing, you just, devices a lot of opinion, doesn't it? It does. I do not think sometimes you need, you can know too much. Yeah. And then it, just like, I'd rather live in a bit of ignorance, go to the lake and just, you know, if the biggings been out when I'm there or just come out the night before, doesn't really matter, does it? You know the difference because I was a member of a syndicate a few years ago with a load of biggings in it and there was guys on there, older guys, and they've been on there forever. They don't do social media, they haven't got a modern phone or anything like that. And they'll say, I had three yesterday at a £47 mirror or wherever, they're not really that bothered, it's been mat-shotted. And then they'll show you and I'll go, ah, it's the peach and they'll go, oh, is it? I'll go, it's the peach, eh? It's what I really want. I'll go, I've had him loads of times. You know, it's like that, just that art of just going for, or the thing of just going fishing and enjoying it. Just enjoying it. Not bothered about getting stuff up on social media. Obviously, unfortunately, fortunately or unfortunately for us in this room, like, it's our industry. We rely on people getting that information and feeding off it and actually doing something about it and going fishing, buying kit and catching carp. So we can't really have a problem with it. I haven't got a problem with it. Like you said, I'll do it. I'll tell people what I'm catching on that, the lake I'm fishing and then it gets busy because of it. But you know, that is part of it. If people are going to go and enjoy themselves because I've posted something great. But then on the flip side of that, and you can tell that they're non-publicity. You can go down there and catch lots and go back down there the next week and get back in the same stream. That is nice. That is the difference. Not going to laugh. But also, that's also etiquette. The etiquette has changed massively. Like there is no etiquette on a lot of these lakes. No, you have to sort of just live with it a little bit. Tie it down, raise it a little bit. You fish one swim for a little bit, catch quite a few out of it and then you can't get back in that swim any more. That happens all the time. It's just part of it. Mate, don't tell me about that. You never wrap spot. Funny enough, we had that last week. When you were having such a great time like we were last week, I thought, it's going to be great. I should really just do a story tomorrow. But I sat down and even I thought, if I do that, that's going to show everyone a mirror. Everyone, you're carving up and having a good time. And the people that do know, that don't, can just guess from where you like, they'll be down here. They'll just come down and it's going to ruin it for me. So I'm like, I shut them up when I get home. I'll keep that a little bit quiet. And you're French trip. Yeah. But then I'm going to come down and... Not English people, but you'll get a lot of Europeans following you and stuff and they'll see... You can't have that many. No, there can't be that many. Thousands. No, there's just no point in putting anything out live while you're there. No, I get what you say. We don't anyway. No. Not because they're going to come down and ruin our fishing, but because you're worried about things like what happened to Darrell when they come down and burn your vehicle out. You're not welcome. And you never know if you're that welcome at places, do you? No. We are quieter now when we go away. Keep a bit of a lower profile. Yeah. Shout about it after. Yeah. I don't know, mate. It's just part and parcel. Fishing's busier now because more people are doing it. I think it's good that more people fish because I think fishing's good for people. So you have to live with it, I think. Well, let's go around and have a little think about where we think it could be in 10 years time. Because obviously we've just talked about there not being loads of huge advances in the last 10 years other than isolated products that are helping things become easier to the masses. But where do you think it could be in 10 years? Like maybe if it's an advance in technology and tackle or social media, where could it get to, do you think? Yeah, I don't know. I think we're a little bit in this spot in general in life as well, not just in fishing, but technology is increasing at such a rate that you either move with the technology and everyone accepts it or there's more rules. Like with the whole AI thing, is a government going to put more rules in to stop AI from happening as much as it could do if you just let it run? And it's the same with fishing really. Are lakes going to ban using drones? Yeah, lots of them already have. Yeah, there's technology of using boat boats and that makes fishing infinitely easier. But actually, does it really come into our fishing that much? No. Really? Most lakes ban it. If fishery owners and clubs or whatever want to keep the essence of fishing there, then they will put rules in place to stop people ruining it. And that's what tends to happen. So I don't think fishing will change that much. I think we'll probably get more and more information. It'll become easier and easier to the masses as it has done over the last 10 years. But in general, you won't feel any different going fishing and neither will I in 10 years time. I don't think. How do you feel about the technology that is out there now? Are you somebody, like anybody here? Are you people that just embrace it and think if you want to use it, use it? Or have you got a problem with it? Dang, I'd probably be the best person to ask. I haven't got a problem with it as long as you don't come anywhere near me. Yeah. If you want to start flying drones over in the swim or putting a boat boat through the swim, then I'm going to have a problem with that. But I'm not going to put myself in the position where I'm fishing lakes where that's happening. There's nothing I wouldn't say to Ali's face. But he was fishing a little lake and he had a drone up and was driving a boat boat to the spot using the drone to see where it was. I'm not interested in doing that. You all go fishing for your own reasons. The thing I like about fishing is working it out and using my own skill, if you like, to put the lead in the boat exactly where I want it to go. If you become completely reliant on gadgets and technology, if something goes wrong with that, like we were talking about your boat engine going wrong, you can't do it because you're so reliant on it. I've seen people fishing a little lake that, actually the garrison we were, and he's putting his bait out with a bait boat not much further than between me and you under a bush. And you just think, what are you doing there for? You could just put it there. I love getting in the lake and putting my rods out or whatever that is. But there's got to be an element of skill and the chase of whatever you're going for. If you've made that particular cast and it's difficult and it's taking you three casts and you think, gosh, it's on the spot. Technology is great for certain things, but it's not for me. I don't need to know if there's bait left in the swim and putting a camera on the bottom of the lake because I see people we know disappearing up their own arses because they know too much. It's blowing their heads up. And sometimes I'm quite happy living in ignorance. Yes, good point. I don't have you wrong with that. I do think that's a good point you're saying about the cameras and stuff. I do think you can go down a rabbit hole. I spoke to Stokesy when I was going out to carp arena and he was fishing some snags in the swim. I knew I was going to fish. He said, if you've got one of those cameras, you can lower down. I said, no, you go get one. He goes, because when I was fishing there, I thought I was fishing perfectly. I was lowering the rig down, getting a good drop. But when I put the camera down, there was loads of sticks. My line was laying weird. My boom was sticking up and all the way. He said, if you don't get one, your chances are you won't be fishing. And I didn't get one because I didn't really want to go down that route. I'm not saying they're not good because I actually think the cameras could be a really big edge for things like commercial waters. When you're turning up for a week and you're following someone in a peg. And you want to check the spot where you're working. Yeah, you can go out there and just lower a camera down on the 20 wraps at the big tree that everyone fishes. And there's 40 kilo there. It'll stop you putting 20 kilo out, which I think could make a difference to your week. So I don't think they're a bad thing, but for me, like you said, I think you could end up... Because if you go to the One Water, we can't use it. And all of a sudden, then you feel, I've got the same drop I was getting before, but I was sitting terribly. You had to provide. I'm probably sitting terribly. So I think you can know too much. You're talking about cameras. I saw on, I think it was Instagram the other day, there's a start up where they've got... The line is a camera cable. So you've got a camera on the end of your fishing line, which is actually, must be some sort of, I don't know... I saw this. It's like an electrical fishing line, isn't it? Yeah, electrical fishing line. So they're lure fishing and you can see on your rod what's coming to get it. It's mental. It's like they're crowdfunding, trying to start getting a start up for it. I guess that's where this sort of question comes from. How far in 10 years time will that become the norm? We're going to see so much more of that. But I will say, with something like that, if you take lure fishing, for example, it's not our remit at Corder, but if you take lure fishing as a great example of that with that fishing line, if you went to your mate that's only into football and don't like fishing, and when he comes fishing with me at the weekend and when he put two swarms out, when he sit down and put the kettle on, or you took him out with that lure rod, cast it out and you're watching the fish chase after him, and he's probably going to be more inclined to, I'm going to get into that. That was unbelievable. What a time I had. I'm going to do that again next week. It's a lot more exciting. We're ingrained in it. So that to us is the same feeling either way. It goes back to what Daymo said, each their own, isn't it? It's like if you're happy with doing it, that's fine. It's not a hobby, isn't it? It's like you don't ruin my day, it's fine. It's like you don't have you on. Like Daymo, so you wouldn't have all those modern day things if you were in charge of a syndicate, they'd be no way. I think it's you and the fish. What about going to huge venues in Europe? I'll get that. I mean, we had this conversation when Dan was in here, didn't we? Yeah. Using the drone to find the fish. If you've got a week to do it, if that's what you want to do, then time's yes. If you're making a film and it's costing a load of money, I can see why we would do it. That's been the only time that I don't enjoy using bait boats, never have done, but there comes a time where if you're not using them on certain venues, like we went to Hat Van, you had to fish 120, 130 meters, but if you've put for one of a better term a normal size hookbait on, it's going within minutes with something of that sort of size. Unless you're bait boating out at 25, even up to 30 mil hookbaits at some point, you're not even really fishing for the fish that you're trying to catch. So they become a, for me, a necessary evil. I'm not going to cut my nose off despite my face. I'm not going to sit there catching small fish after small fish because I don't want to use a bait boat. You kind of feel like you have to. And I guess going back to the camera side of things, I said it's you when we were doing the underwater test tapes. After Dan had caught the big crane, it was just me and you and it was my turn to have a rod on the spot. Now, if I was fishing and I've just gone fishing, I've got a single rod up against a snag, I would be sitting there the whole time thinking any minute that's going to go, the carp's going to come in, going to get one bite. When you can watch it happen, and as exciting it is when it's on, when it's really not and there's nothing in that swim. You just want to cry. Yeah, it was horrible. You just sit there and start that. And then, you know, as you said, you can know too much. I think the drone now is like, especially for talking to the European guys that I talk to, that is literally as important as their fishing rod. Like literally having a drone in the kit is as important as anything. One of the guys who works here is fishing a really big lake, right? And he's a traditionalist, if you like. He's not going to use a drone. He walks around the lake, he does his homework, he baits up. And on that lake, everybody's got a drone. They've all got bait boats that have got GPS systems on them. He'll get an area going. They'll people will find out where he's catching from. And then you've got baits coming across 300 yards and they're coming into a swim. That goes back to the etiquette thing, doesn't it? Sorry, all of these things are okay if people have got etiquette and they're used, right? But if they're not, then it just ruins the whole thing. Yeah, it leaves a sour taste, then, doesn't it? It does when he's sat there at night, he's sat up and you can see the little lights coming across the lake. They're coming out and they're just... Basically in his swim. I'll tell you something they're using staying on the drone subjects a minute. Something they're using a lot in sport fishing and that now. They're actually using them to take the bait out. Fishing from the shore. That is going to creep into carp fishing. I've got no doubt about it. That will creep into carp fishing. Fishing, like you said, inaccessible places. I think things like... I've always thought something like a zig is just literally made for something like that. You can just put it out, fish it out long. Not having to worry about tangling. Maybe have a little PVA loop on it. You can just lower it down and it falls down. There are so many examples of where that could really help. And I do think people, more and more people are doing it. I've seen little reels and things on Instagram. People are using it in carp fishing. But I think for baiting up and stuff, that is coming. That will be a thing. Someone in our industry will bring out drones just for carp fishing. I've got no doubt about that. Us. I'm going to get off on the screen now. This is coming out in a couple of weeks. I think Tom's right though. Those sort of things will get banned by lots and lots of waters. Can you imagine that on linear? Yeah, I know. Drone wars. They won't allow it. It depends. I think with technology, if it makes something that's impossible, possible, it's okay with me. But when it makes something that's already possible really easy, that's when I don't like it. Anything of true value is difficult or rare. And if you make it too easy, then it's neither of them. And then it has no value to anyone. And then that ruins the whole thing. Like catching a 50 pounder. You'll probably catch one next week droning out. It still counts. You've got all that technology available now. We've got bait boats to take out and touch with a button. We've got the best possible bait. The sharpest hooks. Yet you still can't catch a 50 pounder. There is literally no excuse now, is there? Literally everything is available there. It's available, but the person using it has still got to know what they're doing. Haven't they? Have they? That worries me quite a bit in our industry sometimes. When stuff gets brought out that's so easy to use, and the fact you can just chuck it on and cast it out, not having any foundation of looking after a carp, playing it in, actually knowing anything. You can go out and spend five grand on kit, and go out there and pretty much do it quite well on some lakes. I don't know, man. I don't think you can. I think the analogy which I use with Spooner quite a lot, even a blind squirrel finds them sometimes. Do you know what I mean? No, but I'll stay on that because you can. Because if you go to a known lake in the UK that's a day ticket place, if you get in certain swims you've just got to fish in the middle, and that's where all the fish live, and it's not particularly weedy. You've got a bait boat, and you've just got to set the GPS on it, put the bait in and the ready-tied rig and all that. You can, can't you? You can just go and do it. Yeah, we have a bait boat in the UK, and yeah. What's this here? Oh, this is going to be a drone man, isn't it? Let's have a look. Do I get an invite today? We're going to catch you using a shark. Shark using stingray head. What's a pretty big bit of kit in it? For anyone listening and not watching, the lads have put a video on the screen. That hasn't got any sound. Yeah, that's going to show a guy putting out a huge piece of old fish boat. That is a massive drone as well. I think I've seen these on Instagram. And the thing is they've designed them with like quick release stuff on the controllers and stuff. Yeah, I mean, how is that not fun? That's what it means. This is the thing, this is why people get into this type of fishing. Look at that, just churning out a barge. There's no finesse in that sort of fishing, is there? No, big lump of fish. You just can't compare the results, can you? It's the same as a bait boat. You can't compare the results from a bait boat and a non-bait boat. If you catch ten on a bait boat and you're caught free normal. I'm not going to start naming any names, but there are some quite influential people in our industry that have caught some really famous carp using a bait boat and all the carp out of that lake on a bait boat. We don't need to say who it is, but I'm saying there is people that have gone on syndicates, emptied them. The only thing you see is they're holding up for the camera, but they've actually caught a lot of them fish. It's like, look at something like Burfield, for example. There's pretty much nobody on there. I think actually I think they've just banned them recently. But before that, I actually listened to a podcast when I was driving out to France. It was Elliot on fishing Burfield. And he was actually saying that his bait boat broke and it actually stopped him going for about four weeks because he was waiting for it to come back. He literally couldn't go without it because he couldn't fish the spots he wanted to fish by casting because they're too far and they're like obviously like weird angles or whatever out past weed. So it literally stopped him going fishing. We had another one of our anglers was fishing a lake that we fished and we were moaning at him because he was using his boat all the time and exactly the same thing happened. He was trying to borrow one of our old ones because he didn't want to go there without it. That's the thing when you start relying on technology though, isn't it? It will stop you going. For example, would you still go if you were on a syndicate and you did a lot of fishing on the winter or whatever and maggots were the way forward on their bit of body crumb of maggots and maggots were a shortage? Would you still go for three nights without them knowing that chances are you ain't going to catch nothing? Probably not. No, it's not me. So sometimes these things do stop you going when really you need to still go. Well, everyone cares so much about their time, doesn't they? And you want to make the most of your time. And I think that's what people sort of the routine people get into. It's like they go over there, they're enjoying their time in the short space of time because it's making it easy for them. And then when you haven't got it, it's like, I'm really going to sit there for four days for a 10 for the results. But I've just not started in the beginning, I think using it. I think it's a really good topic and I think we'll probably end up revisiting this at some point as things come out and things evolve like when the flying drone comes out with the spot on the end, we can start talking about it again. It's good though, it's a good conversation. You can talk about it all day. I think we'll wrap it up there. I really enjoyed that. It's been good. That went really quick. Yeah, it did go quick. I think we'll get some more questions in for the next one. Hopefully, for you, if you're getting out fishing, I know you're going out demoing next week. You're going to wait, are you going out, Tom? Yeah, I'm out this week as well. I blanked last week. I don't like that. We'll just say the guy that sent in that question that we've just been talking about, I think it was Leon Frail, something that sent it to you. We'll get his details, spoons and we'll send him a little merch bundle, as we said we would. Yeah, nice. So any of the questions that we use, and don't forget, we are going to be going through them all the time. So even if you sent one in the second podcast before last, we could still end up plucking your question out. So keep the questions coming because they're great. All right, decent. Cheers, lads. Cheers, lads. See you next time.
