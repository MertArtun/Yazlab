 This is a podcast from techandainews.com. For more information, visit our website. Hey everyone and welcome back. We're gonna be taking a deep dive today into some pretty amazing AI news. Yeah. Claude 3.5's new ability to actually use computers. Right. Now this isn't just AI, chatting with us. It's AI actually getting things done, like actually working with software. Yeah, it's pretty incredible. It's wild. Anthropic, the company behind Claude 3.5 is really sort of changing the game here. We're moving away from AI that just talks to us and now we're moving towards AI that works with us. Okay. Right inside the software that we use every day. So like what does that actually even mean? So imagine you're working on a spreadsheet, right? And you need to pull some data from a website. Okay. Instead of copying and pasting it, you could just tell Claude 3.5 what you need. It understands what you're asking, it goes to the website, extracts the data, and boom, it's in your spreadsheet. Hold on, that sounds like something straight out of a movie. I know, right? Is this for real? Oh, this is happening now. And it's not just spreadsheets. Think about email, calendars, even code editors. You name it. So this tooling feature, this is a pretty big deal. It's a game changer. Especially for like developers, I imagine. It's huge for developers. Like you can automate so many tasks, you could have AI help you debug in real time. So it really is like having an assistant that not only understands you, but can actually carry out your instructions. Exactly. Like in all these different programs. Across all sorts of applications. Okay, so this is all thanks to... This is thanks to some big advancements in natural language processing. NLP. NLP, exactly. You remember those old chat box that we used to have to use? Oh yeah. So you practically had to speak robot to get them to do anything? You had to be so specific. It was ridiculous. But with Claude 3.5, it's so intuitive, it really understands the nuances of human language. You could tell it to find me the sales report from last quarter and give me like a quick summary. And it'll just do it. It'll just get it. No more robotic commands. That's amazing. It's fantastic. But how are they managing this? How is Anthropic? Yeah. Like are they over promising, you know? That's a great question. A lot of people are wondering that. Yeah. But what's really interesting about Anthropic is that they're so committed to experimentation and transparency. Okay. They're constantly testing things out, gathering feedback, and refining their models. So they're not just like, here's the AI, good luck. Exactly. And they've even come out with two new models. Really? Haiku and Sonnet. What? Yeah, each one is designed for a different type of interaction. Okay, so Haiku and Sonnet, tell me more about these. Think of them as like specialized tools in your AI toolbox. Like say you need a quick, precise answer. Haiku's gonna be the one to go to. It's super fast. Really concise responses. So if I need a quick answer. Yeah. Haiku, I got it. But if you're maybe exploring a more complex topic and you need a longer, more detailed answer, Sonnet will give you that richer, more comprehensive information. So they're really thinking about like, how people are actually gonna use this. Yeah, they are. And giving them the right tools. Absolutely. That's pretty smart. It is, and it goes back to that idea of them not over-promising, you know. Right. They're focusing on building AI that solves real problems. Yeah. And integrates into our existing workflows. Right. It's not about replacing humans, it's about enhancing what we can do. I like that it's augmenting our capabilities. Exactly. This is all very exciting. But I'm curious about how this is all gonna work in practice. Yeah. Can you give me some specific examples? Like, how could someone use Clod 3.5 in their daily life? Absolutely. So let's say you're a marketing manager. Okay. You're drowning in emails, social media updates. Been there. Right. So Clod 3.5 could analyze your inbox, prioritize messages, even draft responses for you. Why? It could even schedule meetings based on your conversations. So it's like my personal assistant. Kinda, yeah. That's incredible. It could handle all those time-consuming tasks. Freeing you up to focus on the bigger picture. That would be amazing. Strategy, creative work, all that. Okay, so what other examples are there other examples? Let's say you're planning a trip. Okay. Clod 3.5 could not only book flights and hotels for you, but it could also find you hidden gems based on your interests, plan out your itinerary. Wow. Even manage your travel budget. That's like next level vacation planning. All right. I bet it could be a huge help for students too, right? Oh, absolutely. Like for research. Oh, all kinds of things. Researching topics, summarizing articles, creating presentations, even getting feedback on their writing, it's really quite remarkable. The possibilities. Yeah. It's endless. They really are pretty vast. This is incredible. Yeah, it really is about making the AI experience work for you. This is like blowing my mind. I know, it's really exciting. It really feels like we're on the edge of something huge here. But I also wonder about the potential downsides. Here I go. Is there a risk that AI becomes too powerful? Yeah, I mean, it's a valid concern for sure. And I think it's important to acknowledge that any technology, especially one as powerful as this, could be misused. Of course. But I think what's important to remember is that AI is ultimately a tool, right? Right. It's all about how we choose to use it. And that determines the impact that it's going to have. So it's really about responsible development. It exiles. And thoughtful implementation. Absolutely. And that's where companies like Anthropic, are they kind of setting a good example here? I think they are. I think they're doing a really good job. Yeah. They're not just focused on building the most advanced AI. They're also putting a lot of thought into ethics and user safety, which is really important. Can you give me some examples of how they're doing that? Sure. One example is their focus on transparency. They're very open about how they're developing these models. They publish research papers. Wow. They're actively engaging with the AI ethics community, which is great. So they're not just operating in secret. Right. They're really inviting people to kind of look at what they're doing and provide feedback. Yeah, absolutely. And they're also implementing certain safeguards to prevent misuse. Oh, OK. For example, they have strict rules about how CLAWD 3.5 can access and use your personal data. That's good to know. So they're really taking privacy seriously. Yeah, that makes me feel a little bit better about all of this. Yeah, I think they're really trying to strike that balance between innovation and being responsible. Right. So being innovative, but also being careful. Exactly. And I think that's really key to building trust with users and making sure the AI benefits everyone. Yeah, I think this whole conversation has made me realize how important it is to just stay informed about all this stuff. It really is. It's not just a tech industry issue. It's affecting all of us. This is something that's going to touch everyone's lives. And I think it's really important for us to understand, like you said, to stay informed. What it can do. What it can't do. Yes, capabilities, its limitations. Yeah, how it's going to impact us. Exactly. We have to be aware of all those things. It's like we need a new type of literacy, almost. Right. AI literacy. AI literacy. I love that phrase. So we need to equip ourselves with the knowledge and skills to actually use AI. To engage with it in a meaningful way. To really understand it. OK, so we've covered a lot today. We have. We've talked about all these amazing things Claude can do. How it could change how we work, how we live. Absolutely. We've talked about the responsible development and AI literacy. It's all connected. What's the one thing you want listeners to take away from all of this? I think the biggest takeaway is that we're living in a really, really remarkable time. You are. AI is evolving so quickly. It is. It's incredible. And it's up to us to kind of guide its development. Yeah. You know, we need to embrace what it can do, but also be mindful of the risks. Be aware of the potential downsides. Exactly. And we need to learn as much as we can. We need to get those skills, that AI literacy that you're talking about. To navigate this whole new world. To navigate this new era. Absolutely. That's a very powerful message. It is. It's exciting, but also kind of a little scary, isn't it? It is. It's both. Yeah. But I think if we have open minds in, you know, we talk about these things and we agree on some ethical principles, I think we can really harness the power of AI for good. That makes me feel optimistic. I don't know about you. I am too. I'm optimistic as well. You're good. There are definitely challenges, but there's also so much potential. It is an amazing time to be alive. It is. It really is. To see all of this happening. It's a technological revolution. So for our listeners who want to learn more, stay up to date.

Well, it's been a fascinating conversation. It has been a pleasure. Yeah, absolutely. It's been great. Yeah, I know our listeners really appreciate your insights. Oh, well, thank you. It's not every day you get to talk to an AI expert, someone who can explain all this complex stuff in such an understandable way. Well, I appreciate that I always love talking about AI. Yeah, me too. And hopefully get people a little bit more curious about it all. So speaking of curiosity, I've got a question that's been on my mind this whole time. OK. If AI can already work with software like this, what's next? What's the next big thing? That is the question, isn't it? It is. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. I mean, things are changing so fast. What sounds like science fiction today could be reality tomorrow. So we can't even imagine what's next. I think that's part of what makes it so exciting. It is exciting. But if I had to guess, I think we're going to see AI become even more integrated into our physical world. OK. We're already starting to see it with smart homes, self-driving cars. But I think that's just the tip of the iceberg. So instead of just working on our computers, AI is going to be out there in the world. Yeah, interacting with the world around us. Imagine AI that can help us get around in really complex environments, help us with physical tasks even, anticipate what we need before we even know we need it. That sounds amazing, but also a little freaky. It is. It's a little bit of both. And that's why these conversations are so important. Yeah. To be aware of what's happening. We need to be thinking about these things, talking about them, and making sure that AI is developed and used in a way that benefits everyone. Benefits all of us. Exactly. OK, well, I think it's time to wrap up our deep dive into Cloud 3.5 and its amazing new computer use capabilities. It's been fun. To our listeners, thanks for joining us on this journey.
