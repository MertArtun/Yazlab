 Hello. I don't know, flowing like the way you want it to do. Yeah, it's like, as long as you can explain it in layman's terms, what you want done. Yes, a lot of times people can't do that. Right. They're like, I don't know. I just wanted to work. How do you want it to work? Yeah, right. I want to go to New York. On a different possibility. Right. Right. Yeah. So I wanted to find out a little bit more about what you do and how, kind of, since we have different businesses and I have different podcasts, which one might be a fit for what you do. Yeah, what I do, I'm a stress burnout mindset coach, basically, because that all works together. So basically, I'm just not, I'm not just, I am a coach who works with mindset and burnout, because there are 100% connected. And yeah, and I know you love the technology. And that makes me working in a different way because I use two types of technology in my work. One is, I think you are known with that because I saw in the connections that you have two people working with that. Especially in the world of your crazy. So that's the hard coherence. And the other one is quantum technology that's not known yet in the US. That it's there. So the way, at least we do it. So in the quantum technology makes it completely different because coaching goes a lot faster. It goes deeper. We make it all visible at the moment that it's all going and we can measure actually a lot. So that makes it so much more fun to coach people. Right. Yep. What's the quantum technology? Tell me about that. You were talking about heart math with heart rate coherence, right? No, no, no, no. Heart math, that's all the technology. That's the one that is using a sensor to measure your heart rate. And it's not like how many beats a minute. But there's supposed to be a certain balance in that heart rate. And there's a lot of information connected to that. How the whole body works, the brain, the hormones, the body, things like that. Now, the other, the quantum technology that I work with is completely different from that. And it's 50 years of research as it's pure science. And it actually started 50 years ago in the US, went to the, you know, kind of sneaky, went to Russia and it's used in the cosmonaut programs. And then in the Berlin Wall time when that one fell down, was broken down. A lot of those professors fled to Germany and there they developed this even a lot more and it's medical certified by now. And it's actually measuring the bio photons, which are the smallest particles of energy and it can measure that up till DNA level. I mean, every kind of cell can be measured. And we kind of look in there like where is the energy out of balance? It shows it all on the screen. And when it's out of balance, we can search really quick. Like what's the reason? Is it radiation? Is it foods? Like the broccoli is not good, but the cauliflower, which is almost the same, is good. You know, of course, that's that's precise. But also like what I work most with as a mindset coach is what believe out of what time of your life is active at this moment and blocking the energy, making it imbalanced. So it also shows you right away what psycho-emotional pattern is there. So it's totally holistic working. It's actually impossible to search for diseases. I do not work with that. I'm not a doctor, so I stay far away from that. But yeah, it's there's all all diseases do have a psycho-emotional reason underneath. And that is what we can look into though. So working, getting those beliefs clear, those unconscious beliefs and what is the imprint like on DNA level? We can find that all within like one click on the on the computer. So within basically half an hour, we know the whole thing that's going on in somebody's mind and somebody's life. We know how the whole energy is in the whole body, how the hormone balance is all that kind of stuff. And we even can help from that technology to balance energy, but also to make like a chip where we can put frequency on. So frequency therapy, just put that on there and somebody's wearing that and it helps. But it gives you information about certain things that you can use like the buck blussen therapy or homeopathic stuff, what minerals you need. So it's also going exactly in what is still needed to upgrade the body. So it's really extensive. It gives people an exact food list they can use and we can even choose. Do we want that on, let's say the stomach because that one is most out of balance? Or are we taking the whole torso because the whole torso is how out of balance all the organs? We can choose that. And then it's always, it's really fun to connect all the dots with all the different pictures that we get to connect the dots with the themes that are there. So it's really exciting. People are always flabbergasted when they see it. And it's because it's goes like that quick. It's really amazing. So now people have to be in person for that, right? No. Oh, no. So how does someone else do it over? I'll scan all over the world because it's quantum. It's energy. It's like if you would use your phone and you would call me, you right away see my face, you hear my voice. It's all as it is and it's there within a second. So how does that work? We don't know because it's energy's frequency. It's all frequency. So I only need like either a picture or we have a DNA box that we can use a little bit of hair or something. We put that in the DNA box, but I also can use a picture and then write all the name address and all those kind of things on that picture. And don't ask me how that's what hundreds of scientists have discovered. It works. If I would have that from you and then which can you, you will see within 15 minutes, it's all about you. And it's really amazing. It's really amazing. Yeah. So that's just from my place here. I work all over the world, which is fun. Wow. It's really fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I've worked with. Shoot. I just left bio. Left my brain bio. Basically it's chromophotography. So when I was working with Shaka Khan, her sister had this device that they couldn't figure out how to use. And basically that's what it does. So did chromophotography and was also a Russian scientist from like the 50s that helped develop this. But it basically created whatever your auric field was from the tips of all 10 fingers. Because each finger represents one portion of the auric field. And so then from that, the software would then deduce like you were saying, so you use Chinese medicine charts and it would show you what part of the body was not functioning well. Yeah. And what was funny is like every thing that we knew about any of the people that I scanned, it was, you know, it would show up. But then there were things that would show up like with the pancreas or gallbladder or other things that they didn't know were causing a challenge. Right. And then I'm like, oh, your other symptoms that we've talked about kind of like that's exactly what would be the cause of that. So yeah, you just need to eat things that are going to or supplement with things that are going to help that. Yes. Reverse or heal itself. So yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of technology now. So and I'm just so happy that this is the only technology that actually shows all the beliefs from early on. I mean, the thousands of beliefs that are there and then are they active or are they not active? Are they in your way? Yes or no. So and that's yeah, for me as a mindset coach, that's the most fun to work with that part. Yeah, I kind of do that with HeartMath. I don't know if you've ever played with it, but like, especially when people are like non-believers of that it's actually functioning is I put it on them and use it like a lie detector test. So if I know them well enough, I'll just say things about a person or things that I know are going to be triggers for them, right? And take them into uncoherence. And then I'll say things about people that I know that they love or animals that I know that they love and watch it. You know, just it goes right where it's supposed to and they're like, oh, and then they're like, they can't like they can't dispute, right? What it is. And so yeah, it's pretty cool. Then they want then they start wanting to play with it. And they just are figuring out that that's what's going to get them to actually connect with that part, right? They were just ignoring. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I used to HeartMath together with what I do. I just, you know, every disease, every energy out of balance has stress underneath it. So having having like the stress in just like straightening your face, that is what really, I mean, it shows people what is instead of what they feel. And you know that probably too, between what we feel and what's really there, there's a huge difference. So I trade like seven and a half thousand people, including the big part of the police force here in the Netherlands. And yeah, well, with those people, I know I'm totally relaxed that they have this sensor on and they're just 100% in stress reaction. OK, well, they cannot go around it. And that's the fun that you showed on the screen. They cannot go around it anymore. Right. And I love that. I like that. Yes, we're going to have many people live in that state. So consistently that they don't even realize what it's like to be in a relaxed state or in a peaceful state of mind or state of spirit. Yeah. It's hard to find anybody these days who was who was really in a relaxed state. That's a challenge to search for those people. Yeah, I think they have to detach a little bit. So at least I should speak to myself. I have to detach for a little bit before I can get that totally away. And it even even when I'm, I would say it's been a long time, probably five years since I've like sat and totally detach for more than a week. Where I could just like, you know, not have to deal with my phone or my email or my any of those things. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I just did that. I just had a retreat and I just was like, I had brought my computer, but it wasn't open for nine days. Oh, wow. Yeah, that's beautiful. Yep. It was great. The last time I did that was a flow genome project. When we went, they, it was for five days on the top of Powder Mountain in Utah. And they didn't have like phone chargers and stuff. They had like one main area where they had things and then they had like a little solar things to put their lights in the tent. But it was actually like, they were nice 10, but it was still like, and it's with like a sleeping bag right? And, um, yeah, it was just, in fact, actually at the end of it, it was funny because my roommate and I were like, you five days to go. I'm like, so what'd you say you do for a living again? You know, he tells me what he does. He's like, yeah, what do you do? I'm like, yeah, I do this stuff. Okay, cool. Like he would, he ended up, he was a TV producer and had done different stuff with BR. And we ended up even doing some business and work together afterwards. Like an eSports hackathon. But yes, it's interesting how when you don't have that trigger in front of you that you have to go to do business. Like when you don't have your phone, you're like, I know I don't have any where to put this. So you turn off business mode and like everybody was actually just there kind of doing more self discovery and more kind of enriching of their skill sets. So yeah, it was, it was fun. But that was my last time when I actually got to do that where we totally unplugged everywhere else. I still had access to my phone. Everybody, everybody cheated and so did I that I saw. So I was like, no, I just said, like, I'm not turning on my phone for three or four days. That didn't happen. So yeah, we have that wish. Yeah. Well, I would love to, I think from what you told me, maybe talk about what you do and your special system on a podcast and how that biofeedback stuff works. Because I'm not, I haven't used that technology and that's part of what I'm doing with my podcast is just sharing all the different neat cool technology that are out there and finding out how people use them, why they use them and that kind of stuff. So. So what I might be able to do is that before we do the podcast that I do like half an hour scan with you to show it. Oh yeah, that would be a good idea because we could actually record that part and then talk about it like during the show because we could show some parts of it. That would be cool. Yeah, that would be cool. Yeah, let me like a little advertisement for you later. So I didn't think of that part of that possibility, but yeah, I love that too. Yeah. So that's why we do our podcast several different reasons. We teach other coaches to do this too is that I'm you're able to trade audiences, connect to new people as well as find, you know, new for me, I knew modalities that could help the people with the same kinds of things that I've gone through. So mainly I teach people how to deal with stomach challenges and pain related challenges. So my sleeping challenges all come from hurting myself and waking up with like back pain or having to go to the bathroom or all these different other little things, right? That lots of people have. Yeah, sounds familiar. Right. And so figuring out like, well, what can I do or what am I not doing that will help change this pattern and behavior. And so that's really all I do is kind of use what I call the compounding effects that my grandpa taught me of just doing a little bit every day and or a little bit more. And if you keep doing that every single day, that in not too long a period of time, it makes a huge difference in where you are. He taught us to do that with like finances, but I figured out when I hurt myself that the same thing applies to investing in our body in our health and probably more so than, you know, money because. Even more. I believe even more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I just think it's so hard to see. Yeah. Most people just can't put the two and two together. And even when we get one part of it right, usually we're getting other parts wrong. So it's, you know, we're always growing. So yeah, that's the good part of the about the agreement to be looking at that one. That we always continually improve. Right. I'm already busy 40 years to keep growing. So every time again, I mean, I just realized I know I accept it. I think even after I'm dead, I will keep growing somehow. So yeah, it doesn't end, but it's fun though. I like it. I don't see it as a problem or heavy or whatever. Well, it can be challenging, but I just see it as fun to keep growing. What's your newest thing that you're learning right now? Well, at the moment, I have a lot of focus on the marketing to getting clients. So since I also went to the United States instead of state, well, not living, but working. That is basically my challenge to have to set it. How do you say that? Well, yeah, to get the client would also to get it known there because what I do is not knowing there yet. So how to get that out in a good way and attract people that way. That's the biggest challenge. And I'm being coached on that, but it's still a challenge. Let's say that. OK, well, we can help you with that too. That's one of the things that we built and what I've done my whole life. So I went to my undergraduate was Indiana University Kelly School of Business and then the audio video company I bought all my stuff from when I went to wine that the company that was supposed to hire me told me two weeks before I was supposed to start that they weren't going to hire me. They said, oh, why don't you come work here? So I got to work at this amazing place. They paid for my master's degree. And so that has a lot to do with the different music things that I do now. I've been involved with. But. When we first started trying to hire the mentors, teams that we had trained with, because I guess we got the training like Pedro Adéu, who does the challenges. He did like Tony Robbins and. She had a sumter. Any of the people that are kind of big in this self. Coaching or coaching industry. He's usually worked on their challenge like Wrigley gum. He worked with their stuff. So we've been big corporations. And then. I stand again and another speaking coach. But what we found was that. That the system was that they were trying to use. They're putting together like two or three or four different systems, right? And they didn't all the people on the team didn't know how to use all the things. And so it was like we're continually in learning mode with them. Each time for something and nothing would ever work right. And so like three years ago, we started our own system. So that's what into market is. Is a system that will. Mark it through your social media platforms. And your text in your email and keep it all in one place. So and then we built a different business in a box. So as the email and text kind of templates. That whether it's a coach or. Like we even have it for lawyers and doctors and dentists because also. A lot of the coaches coach in their profession. And so they're still going to like our real estate agent that's a coach. She's actually now certified to coach people. And she wants to coach them in anything which she can. Right. But. You can't just tell people I can coach you in anything. And have people think you're going to be an expert at anything. So you have to pick what you're good at. And so that's what I'm coaching her through is like, okay. So you already are an expert in real estate. You already helped people with their finances. Here's the niches that I see that you already do. And so I would recommend that you pick one of them and market that. So that's what we did with her. Have a separate website for her real estate. But then a separate one for coaching. And how it deals mainly with finance. But our system works in English and Spanish. And the front end and back end because I said my fiance's most of her coaching stuff is in Spanish. And then we do things like I put QR codes in there so we can use those in organic. Marketing. So we have a direct connection back to the platforms. But yeah, I'd love for you to check that out. You're looking for a marketing platform. I don't know which one you're using now, but I think it's the best under little prejudice. Yeah, I'm using LinkedIn mostly now. So at least I was on focusing that I'm kind of like focus out one. Okay, well, that's what I would recommend if LinkedIn is one of the better ones. LinkedIn and Instagram for coaches. But then that's also one of the nice things with our system too, you can create content and then put it on through the social calendars. Kind of like a who sweet. You can put it on all the different channels that you want. And if you're going to do any Facebook and Google ads like we're doing with the sleep challenge, it tracks all that too and keeps it all in one place. We've got chatbots that go on the website or on web pages on the messenger for Facebook, all that kind of stuff that drive people basically just to make an appointment. Because what you really want is people to be able to get the basic information that they need from you. Kind of go through any questions and then you want to schedule a call with them so you can see if they're a good fit for you. And if you can really support them with what your services are, and if not where you would refer them to, at least that's what I do. If it's not a fit for me. So that's, I think to do it at scale is what becomes hard for coaches. She ended up like now I'm making calls because we just got done with an event for my fiance. And she has like 80 people right that all want to talk to her. That she had, and I just like started my sleeping challenge and it's free. But literally we turned on the ads and we're only doing like $50 a day. And we already had 10 sign ups. So the average one is costing about $4 a piece right now. But those are the kind of things that once you know the metrics, right? And you know like, okay, I've done this a few times. Now you start to feel comfortable. Okay, now I know if I put like $500 into ads this time when I do my whatever it's going to be, I'm going to get like 200 people and that's going to keep me busy for however long. Again, unless you automate the system for sign up, which you can, and that's what we teach people how to do too, is like, okay, now you got these leads. Now you're going to sit through and do the sales calls to you. To build a script. Because then once you have a script, now you can have someone else do the preliminaries, right, to qualify them to make sure that they're the right person. And you can either do that through a storm or through a series of videos too. So we even use AI avatars so we can feed scripts into our system where you don't have to go and record things every time. So he just did one for me where it's like, okay, this is sleeping challenge and it's me. And like, I mean, like put my hands in the prayer position as I tell them like the ending of the program, like, oh, dude, that's funny. I like that. That's like, because I was doing those things when I created that avatar, right? So it just, it uses my different expressions and it gets the end. It's like, okay, I hope you come and have this meditation like that worked out. Like, great. I'm like, I'm like, and it's just funny because you know, like, you can tell, like, it's, you can tell it's not me. So you tell it's an avatar, but like, it really looks good. So you're like, oh, well, this is funny. This is cool. And that's kind of like how we're playing with it too. It's to use it just in certain places to make things more efficient. So you can just basically try to convey a message. We've already got them signed up and you're just trying to keep them engaged, right? Until the event starts. So then they can actually all participate because part of what that I've learned and that we've learned is that a lot of the best insights from people come in the group coaching. So some things that, you know, you need to do one on one, but a lot of things people get a lot more insight, especially if they're willing to be vulnerable with the group, once they're comfortable with the group that, you know, listening to someone else say things that you would have been defensive about. And all of a sudden you're like, that's me. Oh my God. And they don't see it. And now I see what everybody's been telling me. And oh my God. Oh my God. So yeah, I love that part of like that. Yeah. That's groups. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I want. I want to start a group too. So just to have those kind of effects as well, but also to make it easier for myself. Okay. Cool. Well, I can send you a free trial to ours if you're interested in that. Or we have a 50% discount for partners that we're doing right now too. So I could, like I said, share either one of those with you or both. But did you tell me what you said you're just using LinkedIn, you're not using any kind of CRM right now? No, I am planning to because the coach that I'm having now, she also has a whole system thing that I want to start and that has the CRM, the mail, courses, everything in it. And it's also like one platform. So I'm, You know what one it is? You know which one it is? Well, she made it, she developed it herself. So it's from Jean-Han Lor. I don't think she has a certain name for it or something. Okay. I know she hasn't developed, well, not completely herself, but you have people developing it for her whole system. Cool. Okay. Well, I would say if that has any challenges or you may want to share, I don't know what it looks like. I don't know yet either since she's not in there yet. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, so I would just not be able to give you advice on that since I've done that for a while. Can imagine. That's a nice one. Yeah. So I don't know how to help you with that. But if you have problems, I'm here and I can be happy to at least share with you, my opinion of what the strengths and weaknesses are. But also I would say if she's got a system that she already uses and she's going to coach you, it would make sense to use her system. So yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Jo, too. Yeah. Because she also has the complete help in there that doesn't cost us anything. So some new help. Yeah, we have that too. We have a 24-hour 24-7 chat support as well as Zoom support on ours and it's in English and Spanish. So let me know. So and is she still building it? No, she has it already ready. She did build it I think more than a year ago. Okay, cool. Well, when you get a chance to share that with me because I always like to see what else is out there and if there's features and functions I can add to mine that I don't have. So don't tell her. She won't be happy then. Oh, I don't think... Anyone in business that's afraid of competition isn't really playing the game right, my opinion, because there's so many good ideas and good things. It's just like a good coach. You're going to find one that you resonate with that can teach you the things that you need to learn from them that they're good at teaching and usually you're going to lead the rest anyways. So yeah, you can't like absorb everything that they have and usually not everything's for you, at least for me. So knowing what to take that's for me is part of the experience. So yeah, cool. Well, that's upset at the time. What do I need to give you to do the picture? Any picture? Like, can you take one off my website or LinkedIn or do you need me to give you a specific kind of a picture? For... You said you wanted to do for the podcast. I didn't know we were transferred to this camp. I thought, I do I need you a picture for the podcast. I did a quantum jump. I did a quantum jump. Yeah, okay. Yeah, just you know what? That maybe just come a little bit closer to the screen. I'll see if that works. If I make it from here, I need your face more in there. I think so. Let me see how it looks like. Yeah, a little bit further away because now it's like, you know, it is like a camera, like going like completely around. Let's do it again. A little bit back from the camera. Perfect. I like it. Thank you, Karli. Great, Jamie. Well, you are going to enjoy your day still? Yes. Yeah, I'm just getting started. Yeah, I'm not. I'm going to finish up the podcast. And you sleep well. Yeah, yeah. Yes, I will. I'm doing my best. Okay. Okay. Talk to you soon. Thank you, Karli. Bye. Bye-bye.
