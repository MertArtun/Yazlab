 Welcome to the In Early Podcast, where I speak to those at the forefront of the digital assets and technology sectors, telling real-life stories, considering the growth and growing pains of the industry, and exploring how blockchain and other technology has made an impact on people's lives. My name is Matt Green and I head up blockchain, digital assets and technology disputes at law firm Lauren Stevens. This week I speak to Professor Sarah Green, who just finished a four-year tenure as the law commissioner for commercial and common law, predominantly dealing with all things digital, including drafting various iterations of the law commission's paper on digital assets. We speak about the journey of crypto assets becoming property of common law and why that was important, to where we are now, with legislation looking to define things as property, using a negative definition proposed by the judiciary. Sarah is now the head of digital assets and trade finance at D2 Legal Technology, and a professor of law at Bristol University. I really hope you enjoy this episode. Sarah, welcome. Hi, it's nice to be here. Thanks very much. Let's get stuck into it. So your about page on LinkedIn is absolutely not messing around. It says, and I quote, Professor Sarah Green was law commissioner for common and common and commercial law at the Law Commission of England and Wales from 2020 to 2024. During that time, her law reform work included the Electronic Trade Documents Act 2023, advice to the government on smart contracts, updating the arbitration act of 1996, scoping reforms to the law of intermediated securities, did I say that right? Yeah, just about, and drafting guidance and a bill to ensure that English law is well suited to accommodate digital assets. Hopefully, I got most of that right. In short, how did you get to that point in your life where you're doing all these things? Well, as an academic, most of those things I had written about for the best part of 20 years, which is pretty scary looking back on it now. But I started life as a software developer at Accenture and then went back to law, did a law degree, went to Accenture, then went back to law. So I had a natural interest in the way that the law interacts with technology. So I'd been writing for a while about how the law was going to have to change or I thought the law was going to have to change to accommodate technological developments. And then at about the same time, the law commission and the government were looking for people to talk about that and to make law reform along those lines. And so the job came up at just the right time. There aren't that many private lawyers who were interested in the technology side of things. They tended to want to ignore it. So I got the job and it was a dream job at a dream time really because it was 2020. So just before COVID and lockdown, which actually, although that was horrendous in many, many ways, it really helped us get the government to give us funding for a lot of the projects you've just mentioned because they realized that actually, with the physical restrictions, with not being able to see people and hand over documents or use conventional assets because people just had to stay away from one another, it actually meant that we could make our case for why the law needed to keep up with digital transactions and electronic documents. It made that a lot easier. So it was a silver lining to the whole case. It was an easier sell. It was a much easier sell. It was a much easier sell. Yeah, much easier. And for the sake of those who don't know, and again, I always mentioned my dad on this, but for the sake of maybe my dad, let's run through a couple of those or a few. Can you summarize what work you did on the Electronic Trade Documents Act 2023 for starters? Yeah, absolutely. So that is my baby. So that's the thing that I've been. Your face is lit up. Yeah. Yeah, it's something that I've been writing about since 2005, I think. So this is a long, a long, a long project. Yeah. Because it became clear to me, as I said, with my technological background, I realized that the law as it stood wasn't going to be able to accommodate what commercial parties wanted to start using, which is electronic documents. Now, I know people will be thinking, well, everybody uses electronic documents. I send Word documents. I send PDFs all the time. You know, we don't, what's the big legal first? But the point is, and this is the boring lawyers, Lord Bitwell is not boring to me, but it's absolutely essential to understand why we needed that act is that legally, there are certain documents that had before that act to be in physical form. Why is that? Because the law required them to be held and transferred and possessed in order to work. So you get these documents when you sell goods. There's these documents, for instance, called bills of lading, which are documents which represent, for instance, goods on a ship. And if you've got that document in your hand, it's incredibly valuable because there is a sort of legal alchemy that occurs, which gives you by virtue of holding the document, you thereby have right to the goods, which is of course huge commercially. But that explains why those documents had to be in physical form before because they had to be possessed and held and transferred. To be able to wave it around at that point. Exactly. And so that when I have it and give it to you, I no longer have it, and you have it and you have sole control of it and you have the sole copy, well, you have the legally relevant sole copy of it. And you couldn't do that in digital form. The law just wouldn't allow it. So parties wanted to use, for obvious reasons, electronic bills of lading, because with paper, you actually have to get that piece of paper from, you know, maybe I'm a seller in New Zealand, and you're the buyer and you're over here in England. You'd have to wait for that physical paper document to get from one side of the planet to the other, which is, of course, in 2023, absolutely crazy. So the Electronic Trade Documents Act, all six substantive sections of it, is really just about making legal equivalents between paper documents and electronic documents that fulfill certain criteria. That's the important thing because those electronic documents have to be able to do what you and I have just said. You have to have a singular copy, has to be fully transferable so that when I get rid of it, you don't want multiple copies around. It's the double spend problem. I don't want to give you right to those goods and give it to 10 other people. Whether you're in the music industry when people were copying music, that's where were you then? Yeah. So the technology is only quite recently able to do that. So that's what that act does. I'm going to move on a little bit because I'm interested in that, but I'm aware that we have so many questions to get through. But let's have a quick chat about your government advice on smart contracts. What were some of the work that you did there? Yeah. So smart contracts were obviously, when we started this project in 2020, they were fairly nascent and in fact, a lot of contract lawyers didn't like to think about them at all. But I think now that they're really quite mainstream. And when we started that project, we did it with a view to maybe reforming the law of contracts so that it could deal with smart contracts. And interestingly, about halfway through, so the reason that's called an advice to government rather than it being a bail or an act or anything, is that halfway through that project, we realized, and at the law commission, I should say we consult very widely, so we'll talk to lawyers, we'll talk to technologists, we'll talk to end users, everyone. We realized that actually contract law wasn't a problem. So the rules of contract law as they stand and as they have stood for centuries are absolutely fine. It's not the rules that needed to change. It's the way in which those rules are applied in electronic and digital forms. So for instance, very basically, for a contract, you need an offer, you need an acceptance, that's trite law, you need some other things as well. Well, let's stick to offer an acceptance. And the thing is, of course, you can have an offer and acceptance, you're still going to need that with a smart contract. It might look a bit different because it won't be me saying to you, Matt, do you want to buy my Oats for whatever, 50 pounds of turnips, whatever. That's your example. Yeah, because that's what the contract cases are about. There are about Oats on the sea. But for smart contracts, it would be software I'd programmed, for instance, interacting with software you had programmed. But I would have programmed it to make an offer and you would have programmed it to accept on certain terms. So, you know, the rules and the legal shape of that agreement is exactly the same. It was really then we realized it was about educating lawyers to apply the old rules to the new system. So, it was almost about putting the old rules onto a new mechanism that was digitized. Yeah, absolutely. And now let's turn to where our paths cross broadly, right? So, which is the treatment of digital assets? And which started with, and I'm going to run through chronologically, all of the different things that you've done, started with the publication of the UK jurisdiction task force's legal status on crypto assets and smart contracts all the way back in 18th of November 2019. I do, Sesticola, that wasn't me. I thought it was you. Your name was on it. I was an observer on it, but I can't claim credits. A lot of the work was done before I was on board, but you're right, I am now on UK DC and I did do comments on that. When I was googling it, I swear it said something, I saw your name on it somewhere. Maybe you were a contri... I am on you. I did contribute, but I can't claim that that was my work, as I'm saying. So, we had the legal statement and we had the legal statement on crypto assets and smart contracts, which concluded that they should be, in theory, no bar to crypto assets being property at law. And for smart contracts to be legally binding all the way back in 2019, to which you were, I think I put here specialist consulting. So, can you tell us broadly what property is and why digital assets didn't fit into any of those? And I have, I should have warned you before the podcast. I put some definitions on if that's helpful to refer to. Yeah, okay. So, why is property an issue in terms of digital assets? It's... I mean, the electronic trade documents that I've just talked about, really a subset of this, and we would have done them all together if resources had led. So, it goes along similar lines. The problem with digital assets is that for a very, very long time, English law, well, and to some extent, I should say, still does. So, it divided personal property. So, personal property is everything that isn't your land, really, or things, you know, buildings and land. Divided that into two categories, known as things in action and things in possession. And those categories were regarded as completely exhausted so that if you didn't get a thing in one of those two categories, it couldn't be the subject of, or the object, I should say, of property rights. Can we just put an example in? So, if it was something tangible, rather than that's possession or chose as a right, like a contractual right to do something, right? Yeah. If there are examples of those two. Yeah. So, that's really important distinction. So, things in possession or, yeah, historically shows in possession are everything that you would imagine. So, your watch or your laptop or if you look at the historical cases, bags of gold, things that you can touch. And again, to go back to the thing we said about documents, things that I can hold, I can pass on to you. I no longer have it. It's very obviously a transfer. And that's things in possession. That's fine. Now, things in action are complete intangibles. So, things, I mean, the obvious one is a debt. Everybody knows what a debt is, I think. And the point about those pure intangibles is that they don't have this existence in the world, like a piece of paper or a watch. All that they are are creatures of the legal system. So, they only exist in so far as you've got people who claim them and a legal system that recognizes them. I mean, they're hugely important, but there is a massive difference between those and things in possession. So, historically, the law said it's one or the other. And then, of course, digital assets come along and they are, well, I think they're much closer to things in possession because I can have, say, an NFT just to be really generic and sort of quite future-proof, right? Some sort of non-fungible token, whatever it amounts to, that has an existence in the world. So, it's not like a debt because if you or I didn't claim it, nobody claimed it, and a legal system chose not to recognize it, it would still be there. So, it exists outside of the legal system. Yeah. So, it exists objectively. Exactly. It has an independent existence. But, so you would think, yeah, things in possession, which actually I think personally I think that would do. But I can understand why there was difficulty with people accepting that it was a perfect thing in possession because, for instance, some of them are transferred in different ways. So, if I give you my watch, what leaves my hand is exactly what arrives in your hand. And, of course, with some digital assets, that's not the case. They might be extinguished and transferred and recreated in, say, your wallet. So, there are lots of reasons why they're not quite things in possession, but they're definitely not things in action, I don't think. That was the Law Commission report because they have this subjective existence that you've just pointed out. So, that was the problem. We have these assets that people were using, people were spending millions on them, not realizing at that point that if something happened to them, we all know that if we've got a laptop and someone takes it from us, we know that we've got legal protection and are right in this jurisdiction anyway. But people are investing all this money in digital assets. And the question, as I said, to some extent, is still open. Is there property right in that going to be protected? And that has not been clear at all. So, that was the focus of my work on digital asset. And what right does declaring something property give an individual? Yeah. So, if you have a property, it means that you have, it's protected against the world, basically, so that if somebody takes it away from you, sort of interferes with your possession, this is why it matters what the sort of nature of it, then you have legal remedies. I mean, I've heard people say, you can get your thing back. I mean, the peculiarity of English law is you don't necessarily need that, but you could get, you might get the thing back. But it's a judicial discretion, but you would certainly have your right protected in another way. So, say you'd get damages that amount to the market value of that thing. But it's really about protecting it against third party interference. And without property right, you don't have that. Yeah, I think it's about having a almost like a title to something, but it also just gives confidence in that asset to a wider market, right? Because if something is declared as property or treated as property, then there is a sense that a market will treat it differently because there is an ownership status. That's how I saw it. Absolutely. And very importantly, in situations of insolvency, nobody likes to think about this because they don't imagine they're going to be insolvent. But in situations of insolvency, if you are holding something and I have a proprietary right in it and you go insolvent, if I have that proprietary right in it, so say you're a custodian of something, I will be a secured creditor in your insolvency, which means I'm very likely to get my stuff back. Whereas if all I have is a contractual right, don't have a property right, I've just given it to you and we have a contract, you're looking after it. I'll be an unsecured creditor, which means I rank far lower when the assets are being distributed. And that's really bad news. So a property right gives you a strong claim, a much stronger claim than you might otherwise have. When I was looking through the legal statement on crypto assets and smart contracts from 2019, at paragraph 31, it notes and I quote, we can therefore identify the principal novel and characterize features of crypto assets as being intangibility, cryptographic authentication, use of distributed ledger technology, decentralization and rule by consensus. Now end quote and that was 2019 and when I think about where we are now, I would question the decentralization part mainly because I don't feel like there's always a need to be decentralized. You have sort of crypto assets like Tether and USDC where there is clearly a centralized entity behind it. I appreciate this was in 2019, but do you agree with my observation? Do you have any observations on any of those five points? Is that still correct or do you think we've moved on? No, I think we've moved on. So what we, I mean, the difference between the UKJT and the Law Commission is that the UKJT is there to state. I mean, as the name suggests, it was a statement of the law, whereas of course the Law Commission has grace power and that it changes the law. So that they're doing slightly different things. And what we realized that the Law Commission is that we I think for digital assets to identify that subset that can then be the object of property rights, you need to be a bit finer grained and you need to be a bit more discerning really. So what we decided to do, the Law Commission, in identifying digital assets that could be the object of property rights is rather than identify them in terms of putting them in boxes like a cryptocurrency or an unfeasible token or a real world asset representation, we thought, well, we won't do that because who knows what digital assets are going to evolve over the next 10 years exactly. So what we did is we went to what we thought were the sort of the purest, sort of rawrst principles of a digital asset. And so it does overlap with what you've read from the UKJT statement. But as I said, it's it's it's not narrower and we have moved on. And so what we said was independence, which is of course what we've talked about already several times, because that's super important. Something has an objective existence in the world. And then a word which I'm not wild about. But we could never think of a better one. And we asked loads of consultees and neither could they, which is rivalrousness, which is simply that if I'm if I if I have something, if I'm enjoying something as a piece of property that you can't do so at the same time, get it. It's exclusive use of it. I'm going to come on to all of it. All right, okay. Right. That's right. Yeah, I think we've moved on to those two things. Yeah, I think that's broadly right. Looking at it was it was quite nice reading those those criteria. But it seems like we've moved on. Now through a crypto Mondays event organized by Brian Mundo, I met Dr. Keir Finlow-Bates, who in turn spoke very knowledgeably about the fundamentals of blockchain. One thing he hadn't realized was the issue around crypto assets being property as we've discussed. And I explained to him the issues around defining property at law, things that are tangible and rights that aren't things that you have a contract to write to. And that pre 2019 has hadn't really been considered. He thought it was a bit weird. I talked him through the task force paper with the disgust and walked him through the case of any persons unknown, which I was a part of. And in that case, an insurer sort a proprietary injunction over bitcoin as a ransom paid. And the court had to grapple with could crypto assets fall under a proprietary injunction on the base that is it property. It was the first time crypto assets at law had been regarded as property in common law. And it was a huge effort from the barrister at the time, and the wider team. But yeah, Darrell Connell did a great job. And in your view, then, why hadn't this issue around crypto assets being property been considered pre 2019, when bitcoin, let's just say was was broadly released a decade before? I think there's a couple of things. I mean, I think the simplest explanation is that bitcoin was obviously so bitcoin obviously gets a really, a really bad press, I think, generally, and people roll their eyes and it's seen as a very unfair is thing. But and it can be, of course, but then, you know, so can cash. So come the internet. But what it has done is it has spawned so much else. And you know, it's really in terms of distributed ledger technology in terms of getting around the double spam program in digital form. That's all great. But of course, what it what it did come from was was an anarchic, you know, source really. And the the original ethos to it was, we don't need we can do this without intermediaries. We don't need banks. We don't need courts. We don't need legal advisors, code is law, you know, all that sort of stuff. So I think that probably for a while. And of course, that's, I'm not saying this as a lawyer, I'm saying this as a human stating fact, of course, that is fine, as long as parties are happy for it to be resolved in that way. But of course, as is inevitable, all of these things, once they spread into the mainstream, I mean, it's difficult to think of it not being mainstream now, but it wasn't then. And I think it was just, you know, the the the availability heuristic of litigation, if you like, that it took that long for a dispute that parties wanted intervention with to get to get to court. I mean, I think it's that boring an explanation. So I guess it took 10 years from its release to being widely adopted to being worth litigating over. Yeah, I think so. It's a short period of time, actually. Well, I mean, it's increasing, isn't it? I mean, you know, when we started this project in 2020, these projects, I should say, a lot of what we were talking about, you know, felt very speculative. People didn't really know a lot of people didn't really know, especially lawyers didn't really know what it was we were talking about. He fast forward even two and a half years. Most of our audiences had an idea what we were talking about. And as you know, there has now been a suite of common law decisions after a I mean, that was, you know, that was what I suppose you could say started or really, but there's been loads of judicial decision making now. So it does feel a bit sort of like a snowball effect, which is no bad thing in terms of sorting out what the rights are. Yeah, it's been great. I think our jurisdiction has been leading the way with this sort of stuff. Just to turn paragraph 59 of that judgment, A, persons unknown, the judge notes with reference to the statement on crypto assets and smart contracts. And I quote, the conclusion was expressed. The conclusion was expressed was that a crypto asset might not be a thing in action on a narrow definition of that term. But that does not mean that it cannot be treated as property. Essentially, and for the reasons identified in that legal statement, I consider that a crypto asset such as Bitcoin are property, end quote. So at this moment, crypto assets were property, albeit at common law. I suppose the law commission saw this and thought, well, we need to do some future proofing and consider it broadly. Was that the the modus operandi for the law commission? I think we just really wanted to bring some clarity to the law because of course, that the problem with common law development, which we just talked about, which is great in the sense that it is very responsive. And it's a lot more agile, obviously, than statute or what's the person in statute takes years and years to change it, if indeed you can. But of course, the downside to leaving it to develop through common law, through case law is again, you have to wait for the right case to come up. And of course, what you then have as well most of the time, and I think this has played out and it's fairly true for all the cases we have had, is the question gets asked in small parts. Of course, in a, a, it was about, could it be the subject of an injunction? And then you have, you know, can it be, do you have a fiduciary duty in relation to, you know, all these, all these questions, separate legal questions. Whereas we spoke to judges and we spoke to, to legal advisors. And we got the impression that what would be really helpful is, is a bringing together of all of those questions and all of those issues into one document so that we could deal with them all as a coherent whole. And I can't quite remember the time frame now. I think that we'd already decided that before AA was, was handed down. But the aim was very much to bring all of those issues together and to decide them as a, as a coherent whole, which of course is something that judges can't do because they just have to deal with the question. Well, let's move through, through this chronologically then there was the law commission's digital assets call to evidence. Can you tell us, I suppose you, your view already answered my first question. Why was that set up? But secondly, who responded? And what was some of your favorite or least favorite feedback? Okay, so who responded really broad, as I said, and that, and that's great. That's what we wanted. So we listen, I mean, technically, absolutely anybody can respond. We don't, you know, we don't limit it. And their name appears, I think in the back of it. Yeah, yeah, everybody. Yeah, it's great. So it tended to be really with digital assets, it tended to be either end users or technologies of some form, whether they were platform developers, service providers, their legal counsel, and academics who were interested judges, think that probably covers the most of the broad basis. So those were all the bit we got a huge amount of input from legal counsel. And which was brilliant, because we kept being told, Oh, you know, you're, you're, you're, you're looking for a problem. Is that what they said really? I've heard a lot of people, loads of people told us that. And then before this, people would say to me, you know, you're doing this project, and it's only because it's hyped and was a hope for a reason, right? But even when you go on LinkedIn, anybody that touches any of this is always excited about it and promoting it. So yeah, and there were real clients with real problems arising from this. So what was some call for evidence? Well, that I think, I mean, that answers the question about what was my favorite really, it was just the, the really strong yes, we're really glad you're doing this, because these are questions that we have been asked for a while now. And of course, it's really hard to give legal advice when you've got no frame of reference. And, you know, you have very little litigation, and there's the statutes need interpreting, and it's not at all clear. So I could, I could well understand why legal advisors felt like they really needed this. So that, that I think was my favorite part of the initial response, which was, you know, we're not just doing something that's science fiction and space age, and I have had all these things quoted at me. Yeah. And so that's, and that's my least favorite thing was still a few people saying, oh, you know, needless criticism. Yeah, this is just, you know, the law commission wasting time when there are other areas of law that needs reform, I mean, there's always areas of law that need reform, but yeah, so that was my least favorite. Okay. And it's still going. It just seems surprising that there'll be such a pushback to say that this is a waste of time. But anyway, I do that was proved wrong. You were proved right. And next in the chronology was the digital assets consultation paper published 28th of July 2022, which included the law commissioners thoughts on our thoughts following the assimilation of opinions provided under the call for evidence. Most notably, for me at least was the issue around proposed third category of property called data objects, which at paragraph 510 was proposed to exist where a thing and I quote is compromised of data representing represented in an electronic medium, including in the form of computer code, electronic digital or analog signals to exists independently of persons and exists independently of the legal system. And three is rivalrous and quote to use your favorite word. And now the first of these three limbs seems to my mind relatively straightforward. But there were a few points that I thought was worth flushing out the podcast. There is a statement within when I read it, which was an excellent footnote, which reads as follows and I quote, was we consider that all tangible things have been have an informational attribute to them. We do not consider them to be composed of data represented in an electronic medium in any normal sense. End quote, the footnote reads, this would come close to a fantasy or matrix s environment where all things were simply treated as being composed of information. See the matrix 1999 end quote. Why was this something that was included? I mean, did you feel like they're extreme pedants at play? I mean, I know you have to go to the extreme to figure out what the boundaries are. But I laughed when I read this. Is that how far you needed to go? Yes. Yes. This is an argument that we've had. We've heard, well, I heard for years when I was writing about this stuff academically and has persisted, albeit generally from from from one source really and from one support. Well, one source not not one individual, but I mean, basically it's it's quite a strong academic argument, right? So everything is data. That's all we're talking about when we talk about digital assets is information. And for anyone who's listening to this to whom it isn't clear, there is and it's and it's absolutely correct that there is a legal rule that you can't have a property right in pure information. And there's a famous case, somebody stole an exam paper back in the days when they were all in paper and and copied down the questions or you don't remember the questions. I can't remember the exact facts, but got the questions, right? Then put the paper back. And there was a big question about had he stolen that that information. And it was like, no, you can't steal information because it is purely intangible. You can't carry it away. Obviously, if I've got information in my brain, I tell you this information, but it doesn't remove it from my brain. So that there's no independence of the sort that we've talked about. So there was a common objection to what we were trying to do with digital assets, which was that just information and you can't have property and information, which as I said, I think is right. So we have been at pains to point out why they're far more than information, because they are information instantiated in this independent. Well, I think it's physical, but I don't think it matters whether you think it's physical or not. It's this independent form in the world. And the example I often give when I'm trying to explain this to the skeptics is to say that it's just information is the same as saying that, say I memorize the serial number of the notes in your wallet should you have any notes anymore, but say you do, right? I memorize the serial number on all the notes in your wallet. And obviously, I then don't get the transactional spending power of those notes simply by knowing the serial. I need that note and I need to pass that note over. So it has to be instantiated in that form. And exactly the same is true of, say a Bitcoin, I'll use a Bitcoin just because it's the thing that most people have heard of. So if you take a virtual currency that is in essence, if you put it in human readable form, it's just a string of alphanumeric code, right? Again, I could memorize or write down or whatever. The alphanumeric code belong, all the alphanumeric codes belong into some crypto whale. But I still wouldn't be rich. I wouldn't be any richer than I was before I did that because just knowing that pure information is not the same as having the digital asset. It is not just information, it is information instantiated within a system. So then you can't have proprietary rights over property? Over information. Over information. Sorry, I completely screwed that question up. What I meant to say was you cannot have proprietary rights over data slash information. Exactly. If it's just pure information. So if I just tell you an idea, well, so then you're going to do it. And again, then all of a sudden you have database rights, copyrights. You have intellectual property, which is a completely different thing. But the whole reason why the law has intellectual property is that you can't have normal property rights in pure information or in a design or in an idea. So the law created this whole new statutory intellectual property rights, which gave you the ability to an extent to protect your ideas. But that doesn't exist normally at law, which is exactly why statute had to emerge to protect it. And so a lot of people again in the early days said to me, and to some extent still do, oh, but you know, why can't you do it through intellectual property? But the two things are very different. So nobody says to you if you buy a paperback novel, right, you when you buy that paperback novel, you're not buying the intellectual property, you're not interested in the intellectual property, you want to undermine intellectual property rights, copyrights, if you did buy exactly, exactly, you don't you don't want it, you just want the book to read. And so when you buy, again, I'll use an NFT for the sake of being generic. When you buy an NFT, you don't necessarily you can, but you don't necessarily want it. Because you want you don't want the intellectual property rights, you don't want to have it as your your thing commercially to exploit. You want it because you want the border. I know I'm standing this is outdated now, isn't it? But you know, you want the the artwork or whatever it represents, you want the thing you want the use value. And and the thing is when we buy tangible things like books, and back in the day, you know, if you bought a DVD, you knew you weren't buying the intellectual property and you didn't want the intellectual property. And for some reason, when it comes to digital form, people merge the two and they can't see that, yes, you can have intellectual property and digital assets. But you can also have the use value, which is what you want. And this to the and again, we could talk about that for a long time, but that does ask the matrix question, what do you think about that? But certainly as to the second limb, about the data object existing outside of the legal system, existing independently from persons or the legal system. Can you explain that thinking on why that's vital? Yeah, so it goes back to that piece of paper thing we said at the start, it's about partly about the double spend problem. It's about recognizing that now technology can emulate in digital form, what we've always taken for granted in terms of possessibility. So it was only relatively recently to go back to your question about why has this only come up recently, is that digital assets just simply haven't been able to do that until relatively recently, you know, you couldn't have something in digital form that you used in the same way that you expected to be singular that you expected to be exclusive, you know, like Word documents. Yes, we all use those. But actually, the beauty of a Word document is that it's not singular. And you know, you want to be able to present it. Yeah, you want to be able to share it. But when it's a Bitcoin, you don't, you want that to be just yours or a fraction of a Bitcoin, whatever. And so what's really important about the independence thing is that, and this links back to the information question, what we didn't want to do, because it wouldn't have been right, is to say that all intangible things should have the same property rights as tangible things, because that would have been basically... We're not clashing that too wide, isn't it? Yeah, far too wide. Far too wide. Things that shouldn't fall into the category. Yeah, so those in Disha, I think we called them in that paper. They're characteristics. Anyway, those characteristics. They're criteria, I think. Criteria, okay. So those criteria were our attempt to identify and crystallize what it is about conventional tangible assets that make them the proper objective property rights and how they therefore differ from the things we talked about earlier in tangible rights like debt. We were trying to isolate the physical characteristics that separated those two things. And the last point on that criteria that I've had before was this whole idea about rivalrousness. The example given at paragraph 5, spot 4, 8 was, and I quote, was MacKinbury in charge of this part. And I quote, this means the thing in question must be something whose capacity for use is not limited. People must therefore complete, must compete with one, one another for it. More formally, a resource is rivalrous if use of the resource by another person necessitate, necessarily, it's not easy to say this, prejudices the ability of others to make equivalent use of the same thing. This is why I think this was mapped for sure. For example, if Alice uses a Game Boy to play her Pokemon red game, Bob cannot use the same Game Boy at the same time. Alice's use of the Game Boy prejudices Bob's ability to use it. End quote. My question here was why was this provision included? And I think the answer is you've already come up with is that you want an exclusivity to these, these pieces of property, right? That's the point. You can't have, it's almost like an mp3 back in the day where people copy paste and all of a sudden everybody's got a copy of this song, right? It has to be a level of rivalrousness. I guess there's nothing more to add on that point. No, I don't think so. It is really about if it's, you know, if, if, if something isn't rivalrous, you probably don't really most of the time need a want it protected anyway. I suppose so. Could you don't mind? Yeah, yeah, I suppose so. All of these propositions relate to digital assets, which includes digital files and records, email accounts, and in game assets, I think was also included in this paper. The main names and of course crypto tokens. Does this mean then that prior to this paper or prior to at least some good thought on this topic, that an mp3 file wasn't property? Yeah, probably. I mean, what we were very clear about. So this was where we had some of the most interesting disagreement, I think. We had a few round tables where we discussed pretty much the list that you've just read out there. What we decided would be the best way to proceed. And again, this links to what I've just said about not wanting to make intangibles in general, that the objective of these property rights is we didn't want to isolate specific categories and say all mp3s or all digital files or all databases will or will not be. Because again, we don't know how those things are going to develop in the near future. And we didn't want to prejudge, I suppose, what they would look like. So the short answer to your question is, I think, yes. And the way we wanted to get around that was to produce these characteristics so that people would at least have a frame of reference in the future to hold their thing up against and decide whether or not they would have property rights in it. And obviously, you're most likely to do that through a legal advisor, but the point remains. And also, it depends a lot on context, because of course, there is, well, I'm saying of course, because I've encountered it so much, maybe listeners won't be quite so familiar with it, but I've certainly encountered a lot of homogenization of digital assets. So when you talk to people about digital assets, they just say, oh, digital assets are X, digital assets are Y. And of course, you can no more say that about them really than conventional assets, because it depends so much on the context in which they're used, on the contracts in relation to them. A loss of it is about function and context. And you can have NFTs that are rivalrous and independent, there might be another situation where they're designed not to be. So what we said was we're not going to refer to these separate categories of things, we're going to stick to characteristics. And as long as something exhibits those characteristics, it doesn't matter what it's called, it doesn't matter what category it goes in, it can be the object of property rights. And then this moves us to the next paper. So after that, there was the Law Commission's Digital Assets final report, 28th of June, 2023. I hope I've got that right. Yeah, yeah, it's been a long time. It was 30 years. Which broadly follows the proposals laid out in its predecessor, except those three criteria became indicia. Right, that's that's true. However, one limb which read, and that was the first one composed of data, you got rid of the composed of data there. So I'll read out the quote just to make it easy is composed of data represented in electronic medium, including in the form of computer code, electronic digital or analog signals. Why did you get rid of the composed of data bit? So that was the result of consultation. So this is a nice example of how Law Commission consultations are genuine consultations. We you know, we quite often change change our minds. When we speak to all the all the people I've mentioned before, you know, in users and legal advisors, so on. So there were two reasons for that really. I never liked it anyway, I have to say personally, I never thought that we needed to restrict it to data objects, because I thought that the independence and rival rest with it with a real key to identifying those things that need these proprietary protections. And the other point that we use in there, I don't know if you've got it written down is, is because they can be, and again, it's a bit of a mouthful, involuntarily alienated, which means that as a matter of fact, they can be taken from you. So I can take your car if I get your car key. So I'm talking factually, not legally. So factually, I can take your car, I can take your watch, I can take your things away from you if you don't, you know, even if you don't want me to. Can't do that with a debt. I can't, I can't take your rights away from you. I can infringe them, but I don't remove them from you. You still get them, you still get to keep them. Digital assets, so the sorts of digital assets that can be the object of property rights need to be those that can be involuntarily alienated, which is why they arrive or us, why we care that we want them back. And I thought that independence and rivalryness were the only things we needed to make that identification. And then when we were speaking in consultation with various groups, so for instance, they brought the same thing to our attention. So for instance, there were people who talked to us about voluntary carbon credits, so you know. I saw that and thought that was a bit of a left field thing to include, but I wouldn't have thought about it. It's a good thing to include. Yeah, really good thing to include, and potentially massive and obviously growing. So these are, you know, credits by which you can offset your carbon contribution. They're obviously very valuable. They're tradable. I think they're the thing that actually sits closest to the border of, you know, our criteria. But we saw no reason, particularly once we were presented with the arguments from those who thought that VCC should be the object of property rights. And there are cases, there is at least one case where they are involuntarily alienated. I can't think of a snappy way to say it. You're doing a better job than me where it's taking these hard words. Well, I said it so many times. So yeah, so we got rid of the first limb. And I mean, I personally think it is so much better than that. So one point that runs through this paper is the recommendation to let common law develop the jurisprudence in the area. I.e. not to legislate, but allow the courts to figure this out as and when those questions arise. Surely this approach puts extra pressure on judges. It means the only way these issues are determined is where number one, there is a dispute between parties and two, where there are people who are wealthy enough to pay lawyers to figure it out, which is on the most part rare. I mean, I've had personal experiences that have been really interesting. But people don't really want to spend money finding out what's academically interesting. They want their rights, they want their property, whatever it may be. I appreciate that we are now, as we sit here today, at a legislative level. But given that this was last year and that the general sense of things was that it should be common law led, how do you marry this up with the resulting proposition? The resulting proposition you mean the bill? Yeah. So this is this is another interesting insight into law commission process. So for the reasons that we've already talked about in this podcast, we thought common law was far better suited because it can be more responsive. You can future proof the whole thing because as soon as you start saying, you know, in statutory form, what is a digital asset? Is that a date before you've started? Right? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. And so we thought, you know, a that's incredibly difficult. Some jurisdictions in the world have tried it. And those the resulting statutes have run to thousands and thousands of provisions. And of course, once you start doing that, there are more hostages to fortune. So a lot of people, usually non lawyers, think that a statute equals less uncertainty. Of course, one to a lawyer. And that's not strictly true. So the you know, the courts still have to interpret them. So we thought, well, common law is the best way to do it. And common law has dealt with property so well for centuries, that really what we wanted to do was just sort of sneak digital assets, probably shouldn't say sneak because that makes us out of the hand. We thought we should just sort of key digital assets into the development of the common law and let the common law do its magic. But the whole point of our final report that you just referred to was that we wanted to be able to because it is absolutely a bit of a what could be seen as the pages passing the book to judges. And it's a big job for them. So what we said is, well, we'll do this final report that will provide the analytical framework that judges can refer to you. And thankfully, it has been used in that way. But the interesting thing was, we had this round table with judges, as we do with all of these things. And obviously, we clearly wanted to bring to their attention the fact that we were about to go there you are, because all over joy, you go, go and read this. And they said, I mean, we did sort of suggest it, but we didn't think they'd go for it. But they said they would actually find it very helpful to have the report, but also to have a very small statutory and that this was their word, unlocking provision that just made it absolutely clear that in law, a digital asset could be the object of property rights, even though it didn't fit into the two categories that I mentioned at the very beginning of the podcast, thing in possession, thing in action. And they said, that's all they need just to open it up. Because this is actually a very big legal step to go from those two categories that have been there for centuries. And they said they'd just find it really helpful. So we've actually got that little bill, which was introduced to Parliament two weeks ago, because the judges asked for it. So they were quite happy to develop the common law alongside our guidelines. And I should make it clear, they are absolutely guidelines. We are, of course, not telling the judiciary what to do, we couldn't do that. But they just needed that little bit of the door kicked open slightly so that they could then make law. So I guess my question was probably quite unfair then, because actually what now that I've learned why the bill is drafted as it is, it's the judge is saying we're happy to make the law, but help us out, give us that little bit extra to direct the law in the right way, we have fundamentals done. Yeah, it was always like permission, really. And you know, I use that word as something that was discussed at that round table, because Parliament, of course, can give the judges permission and we make recommendations and then Parliament does it, so if and when this bill passes, it will be Parliament saying to the judges, yes, go, go and do it, you know, go and do this thing. And that's it, I guess it's that open door to just give them the ability to go and create law in the way that you anticipate. The latest report, and I suppose the final report published 22 July 2024, and was a supplemental report and a draft bill for Parliament, as we've just spoken about. A short note I put in my notes here, then in the previous paper, the three criteria then became indicia, I can't say it indicia indicia, I don't think I've ever had to say it loud before indicia. So it didn't mean that each of them had to be followed by the Stringoleta do it was something that was proposed. A paragraph of this supplemental paper paragraph three spot 32 notes, a thing will fall within a category if quote, it is functionally analogous to those things that attract property rights and is itself capable of attracting property rights, and two is not comfortably either a thing in possession or thing chose, which is you've described. And I understand that there's some future proofing here, I've used that term throughout this recording with you. And it's not to limit the definition of things which exist now, but to as I say, future proof things going forward. Is there anything that is on the horizon already that you've seen that you've thought I'm so glad we left this negative definition open, or are we still in a period whereby we are waiting for these new digital assets to exist? I think there's there's no sort of discrete category that that I can think of at the moment, maybe that's not so surprising given that we're less than a year down the road. But what I would say is there are two things so VCCs that we've already mentioned, they are so voluntary carbon credits, they are evolving, their form is evolving. And what I've seen even since the report, not the supplemental on the one before that, is the massive increase in real world asset tokenization and uptake from major banks, most of them. This is the trendy thing this year, isn't it? It's tokenization of real world assets. Yeah, absolutely. So was NFTs. What's next year? Yeah, exactly that. So, although we did have those things in mind when we wrote those recommendations, we didn't know quite how big they were going to get and how quickly, and of course the bigger they get, and the more adopted they are, the more refined the technology will get. So yes, I am increasingly pleased that we were so raw with our description of what was necessary and we didn't try and define in any more detail what we meant by a digital asset, because I honestly think that in 18 months we will be seeing digital assets that don't look anything like the ones that we see now. In fact, the draft bill is called the property digital assets etc bill, etc. I thought it was quite interesting but let's not talk about that. Slated for Parliament on the 11th of September 2024, the words digital and electronic are included only as a reference and I think you've gone through the reasons why. The wording of the bill reads and I quote, a thing, including a thing that is digital or electronic in nature, is not prevented from being the object of personal property rights merely because it is neither a thing in possession or a thing in choice. The subject of the bill, however, is a thing. Is that the right word? Seems a bit obscure, a thing. Seems very open. Yes, deliberately so. So, you know, when you've heard me say several times today I'm trying to be generic and throughout these projects I've tried to be as generic as possible. I mean, personally I'm not what, I mean I didn't get, I didn't. You don't have to take credit for the word thing. Oh no, I don't want to take credit for the word thing but you know you've already drawn attention to the fact that it's called the digital assets etc bill and the first line that says a thing including a digital thing. I mean, I actually don't think those parts were necessary. Well, the parenthesis, the bear word says including a thing that is digital. I don't. If it had been up to me and obviously it wasn't, it was a joint effort and a consultative effort but if it had been up to me I don't think we need digital, I don't think you need to put that in. Most of the time it will be digital but it's not, it's not unnecessary but thing, I think is very important. So, thing-ness. Is that a word? It is now. No, it's not. I certainly can't take credit for that. There's a lot of property literature on that and there's a guy called Henry Smith who writes about thing-ness and thing-ness is what we've tried to do there with independence and rivalryness. It's to crystallize and identify what it is about stuff that makes it the appropriate object of property rights. You know, the things we've talked about, full divestibility on transfer, being able to hold it and when I say hold it, I don't necessarily just mean with my hands because of course I hold things in my wallet by other means. Control, I mean control is key to the final report certainly. So, once I can control something, it is likely to be seen and I hope it will be seen by the law as a thing and I can only control things. So yes, deliberately generic because I think all that is necessary are those characteristics and whatever in the future might fall within those characteristics. There's no obvious reason to me and I'm going to leave it in the negative way. There's no obvious reason to me why it shouldn't be an object of property rights but that negative thing was suggested to us by the judges, the negative phrasing, you know, it's a challenge. But I think that's really important because what we're saying is again, we're not telling the courts or parliament, I should say. Parliament will not be telling the courts, you must say these things are objects of property rights. What they're saying is there's no reason not to. If the facts are right and you feel in this case like it's, you know, so, that AA, if you feel that there's no reason why it shouldn't have a proprietary injunction then feel free to do it. But there's no mandate, there's no every time a digital asset fulfills these conditions or exhibits these characteristics. It has to be the object of property rights and I think that's really, really important because that would take away quite a sort of safeguard really, a legal safeguard that if a judge thinks or a set of judges thinks actually this doesn't feel like it should be analogous to a property situation, then parliament hasn't told them that they have to. So this whole negative definition thing is really to give judges comfort that they can make decisions without looking silly. That's exactly it. Yeah. Silly the right word. Well, without looking unconstitutional I think, you know, so, okay, that's exactly it. And I suppose it is due to be considered by parliament. Do we know when that is? Well, it's been introduced now. It'll be... Probably due to the normally tank. Well, and if the answer is we don't know, we don't know. We don't know. It's how long is a piece of string. I mean, it's affected by how long a bill takes is affected by all sorts of things. So the Electronic Trade Documents Act. Your baby? Yeah, my baby was affected by the death of Monarch because parliament dissolves. We had four law chancellors, we had three prime ministers, we had a couple of general elections and every time you have something like that, parliament dissolves. So you lose the... So you can't even predict on the basis of this. It's not usually about the substance of the bill or certainly not in the case of these because they're not too controversial. So the short answer is very much we don't know. I suppose we could say based on current political relative stability, it might be quicker than it would have been for... Or it was for the EETDA. I mean, I would be hopeful that it would be within six months, but I'm... So you're small bit as well. I think I read it all out on this. You did? It's tiny, right? So you just go... But it's about getting the time in parliament and... It's the timetabling, isn't it? Yeah, it's the timetabling. So I'm afraid I really don't know. Well, I hope it comes soon because it it'll give confidence, even more confidence to the market, which is an important thing. I'd like to talk about your new role as the head of digital assets and trade finance at D2 Legal Technology because you have now moved on from the Law Commission. Firstly, who are D2 Legal Technology and what do they do? So it's a really interesting set of consultants, really. And one of the things that I found fascinating when I was doing the Law Commission work was... And one of the things I really enjoyed was being a bridge between the legal world and the technological world because increasingly now, probably more than ever, those two worlds really have to talk to one another. And I think it's still fair to say they find that very difficult because they... Well, I mean, they use different languages and in the case of technologists, literally a different language. So there is a real disconnect often between those two worlds, which isn't helpful. So at the Law Commission, we tried to do that. We had a few very techy lawyers who could do that. And then once we'd done these law reforms, I felt like the job wasn't really finished because of course you can change the law and you can make the conditions quite conducive for people to adopt new technologies. But that doesn't necessarily mean they'll do it. There's always an implementation difficulty. So what D2LT can do is be that bridge. And it does... It deals with both practical implementation, whether it's documentation, whether it's digital assets, whether it's AI, and the legal side of it and sort of meshes those two things together, which we found is really helpful and what a lot of clients want because you can produce a legal memo or a piece of legal advice and then it can just sit there and it's there. But either nobody knows what to do with it or nobody notices it. Yeah, nobody notices they have to do that. That's for doing that but sitting in a drawer. Exactly. And the people who understand that legal advice are not the people who understand how to implement the processes. So that's what we do. We fill that gap. And what does your role entail? And how does your experience as a professor and with the Law Society help with that role? Well, my role at the moment is a lot of learning. So I sit around listening to people thinking, oh, I must remember that. So a lot of what I've just said, which fits in really well with both of my previous roles, actually, because obviously as a law professor, you have to teach some pretty complicated ideas to, at least in the first instance, people who have no idea what's going on about law. And you have to do that in quite a short amount of time. And then, you know, fast forward to Law Commission days. And it was even harder because what I was doing was trying to sell, we had to sell these projects to government, trying to sell these really quite complex Lawyers projects to people in government who weren't lawyers and had about 20 minutes. And we're interested in, you know, what's going to look shiny, what the minister's going to like, what'll look good in the papers. And when you're trying to say, well, we want to reform the bills of exchange act, 1883, because, you know, and you can see that like, you know, the blood drains. Exactly. So you have to develop ways of and you can usually do it through money as soon as you start talking big as you know, this could save us 224 billion a year. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. There's plenty more of a story there. Yeah. So you just have to learn ways to get your point across understanding that not everybody is the legal geek that you are. That's what I'm trying to do on this podcast, trying to help people understand number one, digital assets and tech and law to some extent. And a question that I sometimes ask nice and broad is what is your view of the future of digital assets? Well, I am I've been optimistic all the way through these projects, you know, I've always said to people, we're not just looking for problems. These digital assets are being used more and more and more. I think it's exponential. And so we are going to encounter more of these issues, which I see as a good thing, because that's that's the way that you are now, our problems. And that I think I've, you know, I've been proved right. I don't mean to stress I was the only person saying that far from it. So I think we have been proved right, the people who said that. And I think they are going from strength to strength. So definitely in the past three years, I spent a lot of time on the conference circuit, practitioner's conference circuit. And the conversations I've heard over those three years have come on leaps and bounds in terms of, you know, real use cases as said, big banks, JPMorgan, you know, embracing digital assets, using them an awful lot. You know, it's not just we might do this in the future. It's this. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. And of course, every time that happens, you get then more impetus for developers to make them better. So I mean, exponential is why I see the development as. And I'm going to ask you a question, a final question that I haven't included on the piece of paper. I've just thought about it now while I was listening to you. Is the UK the leader in this? Or do you feel like there's somewhere else doing a better job at encouraging the use of digital assets? I think we have been a leader in a lot of ways. And certainly in terms of private law rights, which is essentially what you know, I've been talking about today. I think we are a leader. We had our Law Commission work cited in Celsius Bank, Cropsey case in the US, because the judge there didn't have any other thing to refer to. So that was quite nice that we, you know, because that's exactly what we wanted to do. We weren't precious about it. We wanted to send that out. So I think in terms of private law development, so Dubai has recently done quite a lot of work, but based on, you know, on what we've done as well, Singapore is always a frontrunner. So they certainly did electronic trade documents before we did, because they, well, they're a bit more of a nimble, equal system and parliamentary system. So in the private law context, I think we are a leader, actually, and we certainly, in the vanguard, I think the other question of course is regulation, because you can private law, you can agree things under private law or you like, but if you're then regulated out of doing so, then it's no good. And regulation wise, I think we're sort of in the middle really, we haven't been incredibly, what's the word, we haven't been incredibly restrictive in the way that the US SEC could have been said to be until quite recently, as I think we've gone one side. But equally, we haven't rolled out the red carpet and we were never going to do that, it's not a very English jurisdictional thing to do. And I think at the moment we're waiting and seeing, which isn't a terrible thing, because I don't think there's necessarily a first mover advantage. So in regulation, I think it's a bit more of a wait and see, but I'm quite pleased that I think we have been at the forefront of the other development. I think we've done a good job in this jurisdiction, I think for my world private law, being in the high court, there's been decent amounts of precedence. And when I speak to certainly American lawyers, they're always relying on SEC type cases. And it's just a whole different ball game. And when I tell them the type of work that I do, they seem to be semi flummox that you can do this sort of thing in this jurisdiction. So I think we have an ability to be a little bit more nimble than others. But my sense of regulation is, is that we haven't been particularly knee jerk, but we have been maybe too patient. But I think that sort of agrees. No, I think we're being too patient. Yeah, I do. I think it's about time now that, but I say that and that there are, you know, there are things being done. It's not as if at all. No, they're absolutely not sitting on their hands. No, and it's better not to rush into these things. And you know, you do need to get the private law sorted before you can do the regulation. Because of course, you don't know what you regulate. You don't know what the link. So I think, I think it will be fired again, this optimist in me. And I know that for instance, the FCA is definitely on it. So we will, we will see. Okay, well, thank you very much for joining. That's a pleasure. Thank you.
