 Hey everyone, welcome back to the 4-4-3 security simplified. I'm your host Mark the Liberty and joining me today is Cory it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood not crying As Cory's suggesting on today's episode, there's actually nothing bad going on in the world and everything is fine. So Business as usual. Oh wait. No, it's not. That's my own dissolution Going on right now. We have two weeks till who knows what We're gonna start by discussing Fortinet's Recent zero day or I guess negative four month day issue that they patched last week And then we will end with the discussion on four companies being fined several million dollars in some cases by the security and Exchange Commission in the United States for a lack of transparency on security issues they had But somehow we'll turn that into how everyone can be good neighbors and And that's apparently help each other out With that, let's go ahead and walk our way in Get off that sweater and get comfortable on the couch Yep, I wonder if any of our European listeners have no idea what the heck we're talking about. I have a feeling they've seen Mr. Rogers So let's start with the first story today, which is A bit of a doozy and just to be candid Like I think we're going to be very cognizant about throwing stones and glass houses on this one But I think it's an important story to talk about where On october 24th. So just last week as you're listening to this Fortinet disclosed a critical vulnerability in the fort of manager api That turns out has been under active exploitation since june of this year Um, so if I could interject just because I you already mentioned it but you know in the same way I don't know npr discloses amazon is the sponsor Fortinet is a a direct competitor to ours. So we know that but we also want to let our viewers know In this case, we're kind of taking off our competitive head We actually Well, you know, obviously we have bias that we have the good security product too fortinet seems to have a very good security product And we'll be talking about this particular issue But it's in no way to kind of there's a lot of intricacies to vendors dealing with vulnerabilities So just wanted to point out, you know, they are a competitor But we really as mark said are not trying to to throw stones in the glass house Yeah, exactly. Um, so the vulnerability is cve 2024 47575 Which fortinet describes as a missing authentication vulnerability that could allow a remote Unauthorized attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands on the ford a manager device So ford a manager If you're uh, I guess living under a rock or an exclusive watch guard customer or someone that hasn't used it before Effectively their management server capabilities for their ford a gate firewall appliances Where you can centrally manage them from this single system from somewhere I will have to say by the way, I I'm I'm trying my best to remain unbiased But the one thing I since we're talking about ford a net manager I think it's very synonymous to the report like the reporting server and more specifically watch guard cloud management that we offer One note is watch guard cloud is something that comes with your firebox for free You do not have to buy a separate license to manage your fireboxes. Sorry. I had to throw a little bit of Licensing shade That is fair. That's said if we're drawing an apples to apples comparison This is probably more similar to the watch guard management server, which Memory service did need license Five I think I think you get five. So you got a free for thrive. Yeah Anyways, watch guard clouds what you should be using clearly. Um, so anyways So mandiant published a blog post kind of alongside the release describing their own analysis of the vulnerability Including some details like they saw The exploit starting as early as June 27th for this one When multiple ford a manager devices received what they said was an inbound connection from a threat actor at the time At the exact same time When they reviewed the devices and the file system They found that that threat actor had staged a bunch of the configuration files from the ford a manager device Into a compressed archive in the temp directory Presumably so they could exfiltrate it off the devices Some of the things that they'd staged it was like the configuration files for all of the ford gate devices connected A database of other information about the ford gate managed devices Think I heard that there were credentials in here as well too Serial numbers and ip's for managed devices basically everything you would need to potentially go target these Um ford a gate firewalls at some point in the future So that was June 27th, uh, presumably mandiant slash google found this because of their uh security operations platform basically their managed security services team But on september 23rd, they saw a second exploit That used the exact same indicators, but this time there was an outbound network traffic connection that went with it That was roughly the same packet size as the staged files. So Well, they couldn't like it's like specifically say they stole the files off there You can put two two together and assume that they staged them and then exfiltrated them off of the device Um interestingly though, so after a further review mandiant didn't find any other malicious files Created during that period which I like let's pause and talk about that for a second Like they presumably had effectively full remote code execution on this ford a manager device They could have Added a implant or some like remote access capabilities to it But it seems like all they did was stage a bunch of the configuration files from the firewalls on it and exfiltrate them and really Nothing else. I thought that's Interesting. You don't typically see threat actors hold back unless there's like They're waiting to do something else later And I think we'll talk about it and I think uh people that have been watching the video of this probably saw our reference to a Threat actor that is known to be nation state, but it feels clearly like nation state staging of like They want to get access to a device long term Understand everything they can from it so you could see why they would have value in pooling configuration files that have data They can use but not necessarily exploit in any way have it just sitting there ready for when One day in the future if they were to do some sort of offensive cyber campaign may be tied to a Kinetic campaign too it would be all ready to go so definitely interesting Obviously getting into speculation here Although I think we mandiant has attributed this to a nation state actor We'll talk about but it it definitely reeks of nation state, you know I'm trying to get persistent access but quietly live here without doing any damage so I don't get caught Yeah, like a few other interesting details on it. I guess there's a bit more to the story so Fortinet actually originally released version 7.2.8 and actually revisions for all of their currently supported versions of forda manager At least a week prior with basically empty release notes for them Uh and sometime around then they also sent an email to a bunch of their partners With uh, I don't have a copy of it, but it was explained in a reddit thread that there's basically a paragraph at the front Saying don't share this you're under nda kind of thing but it included instructions for them to update as quickly as possible and uh, Cory's favorite, uh, journalist at ours technica was pretty quick to point out that this feels like they were um This is I guess where it comes to uh Being very careful about word choosing but from his perspective It sounded like they were trying to like hide it instead of being actually radically transparent about the vulnerabilities and I think this Cory Is probably where there is some nuance to this And uh, this is this is worth talking about we we jokingly talk about how dan gooden is my my favorite journalist The truth is actually dan gooden is a good journalist I followed him in ours technica for a while and he releases a lot of interesting things On the flip side, we have a personal experience that sometimes we don't agree 100 with this characterization. So Dropping from the ford in it issue for a while People listening to the podcast and using watch car devices probably remember cyclops blink One of the key things about cyclops blink is we did in our belief Apparently release a fix for what is likely the root cause of cyclops blink Long before we even knew cyclops blink was happening It was uh, so the way we typically tell our customers because that's really who all you have to tell about Vulnerabilities is through things like product blog posts and release notes We released an update long before we knew a cyclops blink fixing the flaw that we just did describe as a a serious flaw Long before it happened But at the time we had no process to report cv numbers to our vulnerabilities. So Long after cyclops blink even after we transparently talked about that Dan had issue with they basically claimed we weren't transparent about it ultimately because we released a cv for it later And we just don't believe that's the case. I mean we detailed the vulnerability We warned people to get the patch. We weren't trying to hide any vulnerability I admit we we later on agree that we want to follow a cv process for every single customer Any vulnerability that requires customer action? So we were just kind of immature in our cv process But I I think the only issue we had with dan's article is the fact that he accused of us not being transparent and trying to hide something When it was simply not having cvs was normal For us until we eventually became a cna where we we apply cvs to all our vulnerabilities now So I I just tell that story in that Not that dan goodin's not a good journalist But we I honestly very much disagree that we weren't transparent with that vulnerability So I would like to give uh ford in it some benefit of the doubt. There might be more to the story We don't know that said I do have to admit it's Uh, it is interesting. So that aside keep going on this mark It is interesting that Like I I can think of it for like two ways. I understand this is an important issue and very important for their Uh, their channel their their managed service providers that work with them who I assume is probably the larger portion of their install base for ford a manager needing to manage a bunch of remote devices And I can understand if you are aware of something that might be under active exploitation your immediate goal is to protect your customers and try and get them to upgrade before every other threat actor out there Uh, potentially knows about the vulnerability But you know the the flip side of that is and generally what In the security industry and like what sysa is pushing for is There's benefit to being as loud about a vulnerability as quickly as possible to give your customers the ability to mitigate otherwise Even if they can't upgrade immediately To make informed decisions as quickly as possible understanding that it might tip off more threat actors to begin targeting it But the benefit being everyone has a chance to do something at least And by the way, that's how we believe we were with Cyclops spring once we knew about it And we had the okay to talk about it We went far and wide So we actually agree with that level of transparency I will say before like this story broke early in the week for us and frankly the article I'm showing now is the first article we saw before mandiant released their their research Which they did basically right after dan's article And and then fordynet released their official advisory, which i'll show too But Before we know for sure when this article was all we had that the one other place You may have to slow down a release is if you have government authorities that have joined you for an investigation And they demand you slow down releases So I I think you just actually You and I both are our partners with sysa and and have friends at fbi So we kind of follow all of their advice on on how they do things and there are like I actually think because sec now if your public company requires you to report things within a very short period of time They have to be a little more clear on There might be cases where Investigative authority might tell you to slow down and might work with the doj to actually get you legal Orders to do that and one of those cases might be things like active command and control channels that the Government thinks they have a chance of knocking down the entire infrastructure And they don't want to kind of scare off the threat actor So the only other thing I wanted to point out is when we were trying to figure out from this article You know why fordynet may have delayed something if they did Just know there are certain circumstances where you're actually forced to through governments because of investigations But if those are the cases those will come out over time That that actually didn't affect us in our cve because we had actually disclosed our vulnerability long before it was just cyclops Blink was new but we did have to hold off talking about cyclops blink until we had to go ahead from a number of government parties the one uh like speaking of it from experience on this one is when you are ordered to Like basically a gag order for lack of a better word for it a word. Yeah, it's pretty complete Meaning you really can't do anything at all that might tip it off And so yeah, like the my thought when thinking about this fordynet one is they did at least put out a release And they started no notifying a select group of partners to go upgrade And if they were under I mean obviously I don't understand exactly what's going on behind the scenes and so this is all conjecture, but if they were like let's say under some government order because There's an opportunity to disrupt the threat actor further and they they need time I would would have assumed that they just would not really they may not have taken even this risk Despite any sort of nta. They're like because it clearly did tip people off humorous Yeah, there's a reddit thread. I do you accept the nda just by reading release notes anyways Correct. So yeah, that's but they have since by the way They have since given an official piece or reply. So if you are a customer and are curious make sure to go check that one out I think like my main takeaway from this is as much as security vendors want to be as transparent as possible As much as software vendors want to be as transparent as possible. There is always nuance and there's probably like you said more to the story I'm I'm assuming fordynet had a very good reason whatever that reason is because Like they are taking a bit of a punch in the face right now from at least kori's favorite journalist Yeah, I definitely hope so like to me This is kind of how you tell the difference between a good security company and a negligent one like There is enough nuance that you we have had experience where you can't always judge So we may have to delay things with government actions for instance, but I think you and me have found The the world understands that vulnerabilities happen to everyone to all software or if you don't companies more than others Yeah, exactly if you're particularly negligent in your coding practices But like I would argue people like apple and microsoft and amazon probably have very decent app sec teams now And they've been whether they did 20 years ago is in question But they've been forced to and yet they still have vulnerabilities occasionally. So I think people You'll get the best judgment by being as transparent as possible And I you know everyone's worried about reputation loss and things like that and will it affect revenue and this and that I actually think you'll have the best effect even on your business and profit by being transparent because It's this type of Transparency we demand from from anyone and even from you know our users and that the more transparent you are the quicker We can fix it as a security organization If if you know someone accidentally clicked the fish so ultimately I think for the industry There there might be some exceptions where being transparent too quick can actually put more risks to customers So that is one thing you have to think about but generally transparency is a good thing Because we know people make mistakes and if you're accountable for them and in your transparency clearly outline How you've learned from them. I think that's the most important part of transparency that you've fixed it that you're taking action And that you're doing something different. I think that just builds trust so Uh, maybe one day we'll find out why it took so long to get like an official patch out for something that was being exploited but Interesting story for sure Uh, which we knew more about the nuance. I guess we'll find out. Well, Dan will good and release any more articles It's possible. Maybe we'll find something out And in the coming months But moving on core you mentioned in that last story about how in some cases like with the sec for publicly traded companies You are obligated to disclose security issues Well last week we found out what happens when you don't quite follow those rules as much as you should have The united states securities and exchange commission the sec is responsible for regulating publicly traded companies in the u.s Announced that they were charging and imposing penalties on four companies for making misleading disclosures linked to the 2019 solar winds data breach before we continue I already mentioned this to you over chat kori solar winds was five years ago I lost my mind. I still use it as like a relevant and timely thing So I think like in my brain it's somewhere within the last two or three years five years. Wow And I also frankly our new job you and I have been security experts and thought leaders at watch guard for a while But we didn't actually run the security for watch guard until I guess maybe three years This was one of the things that Made watch guard, you know, we've always been a security company. We've always had security in our cio department but making it a standalone thing was in part because of Targeting of it and security companies. So I can't believe it's been five years five years. Anyways, so the end result the sec Find an ordered checkpoint to pay $995,000 from misleading statements Mimecast was ordered to pay 990,000 Unisys was ordered to pay four million and we'll get into why that was a bit higher in a second Then avaya was ordered to pay one million Each of the four companies were the victims of the solar winds Orion supply chain compromise back in 2019 the sec does say that each company committed different violations that effectively negligently Diminished and minimized the actual damage of the breaches There was a quote from the sec's division of enforcement acting director. They said While public companies may become the targets of cyber attacks It's incumbent upon them to not further victimize their shareholders Or other members of the investing public by providing misleading disclosure About these cyber security incidents that they encountered Um, can we before we even get into some of the talking points? I'm sure you have The the the biggest bummer here like like one I think we're I think it is kind of negligent not to give shareholders and your customers accurate information about a breach But the bigger bummer here is this is a software digital supply chain leak the none of these four companies necessarily Did anything security like preventative security wrong to get hacked? They were hacked because they used a solar wind product that was insecure and got trojanized so now they are They are ready, you know, the issue with supply chain issues is you have to pay for someone else's security mistake But now they have to pay fines on top of it. Granted it is for maybe I would argue they depending on the details in these cases. Yes, you could be if you were Affected by this you should have told your customers But it just makes it ironic even more so and really slam home How much supply chain attacks can actually harm those third-party companies? So yeah, just my first impression right away An important distinction those they aren't necessarily they're not being fine because of any security lapses or the hack itself It is like we just had a big chat about transparency and the sec communication requires transparency and in this case they weren't as transparent as they were supposed to be And the sec is doing it mostly for people for the stock market but I think especially those customers and I honestly think it's kind of The easiest thing to be transparent about is if you've lost or you have customer data at risk Because some other company messed up really bad granted that that doesn't take the liability off of you But you know, we already talked about how if you're transparent about mistakes customers seem to be forgiving of it As long as you take the right actions to take care of it But imagine you're also telling them about a mistake that is so obviously nothing you could have Done about it's a well-known software product. It's one that got trojanized that had nothing to do with you You know what I mean? It seems to be if you have to tell people you were breached It's like the the easiest breach to talk about that guess is ultimately not really your fault So what a horrible one to decide not to be transparent about Yep So like in avias case They said that the hackers had accessed quote a limited number of company emails But they did not disclose that the attackers had also accessed at least 145 files on their cloud file sharing environment uh checkpoint described the intrusion as just general risks Despite knowing that they had been breached Mimecast minimized the attack by failing to disclose the code and the quantity of company encrypted credentials that were stolen by the attackers And then unisys just straight up Didn't tell anyone that they had been breached when they uh, we'll talk about a filing that every company for like Last like several decades has to do on an annual basis But when unisys described their uh cyber security events, they described them as a hypothetical risk for them Even though they were hit by two solar winds related breaches in that year Um, so all four companies agreed to pay the penalties and cease and desist from future violations They will also release statements that basically came down to we don't think we were misleading But we're paying it anyway just to get this away from us that sort of statement Um, but like there's a couple interesting things in here So the breach was in 2019 and presumably they would have needed to disclose in like late 2019 early 2020 I don't remember the exact time frame when it was But up until recently there actually wasn't any like Direct verbiage around requiring cyber security incident disclosures by the sec The requirements were strictly reporting any material corporate event Up until let's say 2023 Um publicly traded companies There's a form called the 8k form that they're supposed to file publicly with the sec anytime. There is a material corporate event Which in the end of last year the sec actually explicitly added cybersecurity incidents as a material event that require an 8k filing within four days of realizing its material four days Um, but even before then there's also like annual forms that every company every publicly traded companies required to file it's the 10k for domestic companies or the 20f for uh international companies that are traded on the public stock exchange here And in that form they're supposed to mention like general risks that might affect the company And this is what got unisys in trouble where in their 10k they just talked about cyber incidents as a hypothetical risk When in reality they had been hit twice that year and they just failed to disclose it entirely But so in 2023 uh at the end of the actually in june and it became effective in december The sec added those new rules where now there is a four day mandatory disclosure timeline for one of these public form 8k's The wording is as soon as uh You've the companies determined it is a material cybersecurity incident Uh, they are required to disclose within four days. So that doesn't necessarily mean within four days of the event happening It's just once you've determined it might seem material Meaning it could impact your share shareholders or Someone's willingness to invest in the company. That's basically the criteria for material Then you have four days to file that Which is pretty short But that said there's actually ways to extend that like if you work with the doj. There's actually mechanisms for getting that extended if you meet certain criteria The criteria being if there's like a threat to national security or public safety Which sounds extreme, but in practice It's actually pretty easy to meet a couple of those like basically if you have any Any customers in like a critical infrastructure sector. It's pretty easy to get one of those extensions If you have any government contracts, it's extremely easy they even mentioned if you uh like Need to need more time in patching whatever issue it was That could be justified as a threat to public safety and getting an extension So there's ways around it, but on the face of it The sec's requirements are still one of the more strict disclosure requirements in like the world Most of the time it's like a month to three months. So I think the worst states mandatory full disclosure Starts with the v so it's something like Vermont or something is something like 30 days So the sec definitely wins with the four days There are some more strict ones in like critical infrastructure sectors like specific ones that are being mandated by Sysa and the federal government, but just for like general companies like I don't know. I find it a little I understand But I find it a little funny that like some of the strictest requirements come from not protecting like people or customers But from protecting shareholders that just it feels absolutely American. It all comes down to money. Yeah A little insane your fun my profits stop Like to round this back around though They're not being these four companies aren't being penalized because they had a security incident They're being penalized because they weren't transparent about it in a way that it was mandated by regulations And I think if there is any takeaways just you know, like you mentioned earlier, I was gonna say steam mark. Yeah Oh go ahead finish your thought and Like security events vulnerabilities They can and do happen to everyone and just being transparent about it Is the easiest way to make sure that you don't get thrown into prison or find a million dollars from it Yeah, and this is a surprise to mark but transparency is obviously a theme Luckily the good news is this is not any sort of breach But I did feel like I should throw in one more real story there that I'll put up on the screen If you're not aware if you're if you're a watchguard customer, especially if you use ospoint early this week As I'm showing on the screen right now We actually detected a global brute forcing That affected our off point service So off point just so if you're not a customer or if you know it's a mfa service that can apply to your login your sass apps Or just about any sort of third party integration through radius and other integrations like saml So basically we detected a very very basic attack of ssl vpn platforms that seem to affect maybe systems beyond watchguard Something that all companies have been reporting all this year I think talus had a good study in april talking about seeing increases in ssl vpn portals being brute forced and by brute forced I I mean they may not have any credentials Or passwords the credentials they're using may be random common ones like admin They probably aren't Although they may in some cases use credentials that are really on that ssl portal and the passwords They're trying are randomly or are totally random So it's not it's really kind of a benign attack if you follow basic password security And especially if you have a mfa product like ospoint But during the week we had some ospoint authentication issues because we were getting these at a volume That uh was literally making legit authentications take longer than normal so No breach to us no breach to our customers But if you're curious about some ospoint outages early in the week We have blog posts talking about this and the main reason I really wanted to talk about it Is a lot of these authentications are coming from the ssl vpn portal of fire boxes And there's a lot you can do to protect everyone from this You know, there's ways you can actually stop your portal or try to stop your portal from uh being a member pushing these false Authentications through one is when this happens from known ip's we've been adding those ip's to what we call our botnet detection list So if you have botnet detection enabled you might just block this But furthermore, there's a knowledge base where we talk about all kinds of ways you can identify if these brute forces are happening against your box as well as maybe lock down your your Service a bit more to prevent this from happening. So It's not like we have to be transparent by out a big vulnerability or breach But I thought it was a good time just because it's something that's been happening this week and affecting Our own customers that use ospoint So do you know about that blog post and if you have a firebox help protect the world by taking advantage of some of our protections So I squished that in context on that by the way, so we've got a honey net of firebox appliances deployed around the world And we've been monitoring these authentication attacks since well years now That core you mentioned the tallos article back in april like we were seeing the same attack against our honey net back then It actually looked like a at the time. It was like a pretty sizable one too We were seeing I think at peak 7 000 authentication attempts a day on the honey net, which was pretty big at the time Just to put it in context during this last event The honey net had around 2 million authentication attempts a day 3d times more. I think you said you did the calculation. Yeah Absolutely insane scale on that one. Yeah, absolutely nuts. But ultimately This is like the lowest form of authentication attacking But but the unfortunate context is is enough volume that it disrupted our service Although on the back end we've done a lot to throttle and adjust our and scale our service so that you should not see Offpoint problems, but still the good note good to know this is happening in the background Even if you're not a firebox customer, by the way If you have ssl vpn portals, this is happening to you So if your product has any way to auto block ip's that fail multiple times on authentication I'm definitely enabled that feature Yep, 100% good advice And uh with that I guess that's the end I don't have anything super sad to say. Yeah, no doom stay for once Just be transparent and be good neighbors We should have mr. Roger come out. I should take off my sweater and leave the house now to some nice calming music Oh, I missed that guy And the world was just a little bit better when it was so much night. We need a mister. I would vote for him Hey, something tells me he would never run for anything in this political. No, he knows better He has better ways to affect the world. Yep. We miss you mr.
