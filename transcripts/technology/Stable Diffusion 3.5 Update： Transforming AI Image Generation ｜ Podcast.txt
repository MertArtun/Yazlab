 This is a podcast from techandainews.com. For more information, visit our website. So you want to know what all the fuss is about with this stable diffusion 3.5 update, huh? I mean, yeah, everyone's saying it's changing AI image generation, but is it all hype? Or is there something really there? Well, let me tell you, there's definitely substance behind the excitement. This isn't just a minor tweak. Oh, so we're talking about a major overhaul. Yeah, you could say that. What's really interesting is that stability AI didn't just release one new model. They actually gave us a couple of different versions, stable diffusion 3.5 and large turtle. So it's not a one size fits all situation anymore. Exactly. It's more like they've given us a specialized set of tools. We can choose which one is best, you know, depending on what we're working on. OK, I see. So it's like a toolbox, then. Yeah, I picked the right tool for the job. Exactly. All right. Well, I am intrigued. Let's talk about those two versions then. Large and large turbo. What's the difference? Well, think of it this way. If speed is everything, so you need to quickly generate a bunch of different concepts, maybe for a client, right? Sure. Then large turbo is your go to. Because it's all about speed, churning out those images super fast. So for someone like, I don't know, a graphic designer with a tight deadline. Absolutely. I mean, you could mock up a whole website banner in minutes, trying out different ideas and compositions without waiting forever for those images to render. I can definitely see how that would be a game changer for a lot of people. But what about those projects that, you know, need more detail, more finesse? Yeah. Where you need to really control every aspect of the image. Right. And that's where stable diffusion 3.5 large comes in. It's more of a balance between speed and quality. OK. Still significantly faster than the older versions. But you get more control over the final result. Got it. So imagine you're creating a super detailed illustration, like maybe for a children's book, right? Yeah. Large would let you really carefully craft each element, make sure the image is exactly how you want it. So it's almost like large turbo is, you know, having a really fast sketch artist. Yeah. And then large is like working with a master painter who's taking their time to get all those details just right. That is a great analogy. And the best part is you get to choose which approach, you know, works best for what you need. That's fantastic. But then on top of all that, there's the whole open source aspect of this release, right? Yeah. That's going to be pretty huge for the community. It's a game changer, no doubt. By making stable diffusion 3.5 open source stability. AI has basically invited everyone to participate in the development and evolution of this technology. So it's not just about using these tools. It's about contributing to them as well. Exactly. Now developers can build their own custom tools and plugins for stable diffusion. Artists can share their own unique workflows and techniques. And researchers, they can dive deep into that code and explore new possibilities. I can see how that kind of open collaboration would lead to faster innovation and, you know, much richer creative ecosystem. Yeah, absolutely. So instead of just a single company driving the development, we've got this global community, right? All these passionate people pushing those boundaries of what's possible. It's kind of like, you know, think of the early days of the internet. When all that information became freely accessible, it led to an explosion of creativity and innovation. I see where you're going with this. This could really shake things up, not just for artists and developers, but for, well, anyone who uses images in their work. Exactly. Wow. And this is just the beginning, you know, as more people get their hands on stable diffusion 3.5, we're going to see even more creative and innovative applications popping up everywhere. This is really exciting stuff. Oh, yeah. It is a very interesting time to be part of AI image generation. It really feels like we're on the verge of something truly transformative. I agree. But before we, you know, get too ahead of ourselves, I think we should dive a little deeper into some of the specifics of this release. You mentioned how open source is going to allow developers to build custom tools. What kind of tools are we talking about? What are the possibilities? That's a great question. Let's start with something called a control net. Okay. Control net. I've heard that term, but I'm not entirely sure what it is. How does it work with stable diffusion 3.5? Think of control net as a way to give stable diffusion more guidance, more direction, you know, when it's generating an image. You're essentially giving it extra information to help it understand the structure and composition that you want. So it's like giving the AI a set of blueprints. That's a great analogy. And with stable diffusion 3.5, those capabilities have been significantly enhanced. Oh, so. Well, there's a wider variety of control net models now, each designed to help you achieve different creative effects. Can you give me some examples? What kind of effects? Sure. Imagine you want to generate an image of a person in a specific pose, right? Yeah. Well, with control net, you could just provide stable diffusion with a simple sketch of that pose, and it'll use that to, you know, generate an image that matches what you had in mind. So I could sketch a stick figure doing a handstand and stable diffusion would create a realistic image of a person in that exact pose. Exactly. And it's not just poses. You can use control net to, you know, guide everything from the overall composition of the image to the style and texture of the elements within it. That sounds incredibly powerful. Are there any limits to what you can do with this? The possibilities are, I'd say, pretty vast. And with stable diffusion 3.5 being open source, we can expect those developers to push those boundaries even further. Wow. We're already seeing some really creative applications of control net from generating images that match specific lighting schemes to illustrations that mimic, you know, the style of famous artists. It sounds like control net is opening up a whole new world for artists and really anyone who wants to create unique imagery. But I have to admit, I'm still wrapping my head around how this all works. Yeah. Can you break down, you know, the technical side a little bit? How does control net actually interact with stable diffusion? Sure. At its core, stable diffusion is a neural network that's been trained on a massive data set of images, right? When you give it a text prompt, it uses that to generate a new image that matches your description. Control net adds another layer of information on top of that text prompt. So it's like saying, OK, here's the general idea, but stay within these lines. Exactly. And those lines can be anything from a symbol sketch to a complex 3D model. I see. So control net is essentially giving the AI a more detailed roadmap, making sure that the final image is more aligned with your vision. Precisely. And with stable diffusion 3.5, the way control net interacts with that neural network has been refined and improved. So you get even better results. This is all fascinating stuff. But I have a feeling we're just scratching the surface here. There's got to be more to this update, right? You're absolutely right. We haven't even touched on some of the other key features of stable diffusion 3.5, like the improvements to image quality and all the new safety features. Well, it sounds like we've got a lot more to discuss. Indeed, we do. There's a whole world of creative possibilities to explore. I'm already looking forward to it. As am I. So picking up where we left off, let's talk about image quality. It's one thing to have AI that can make images quickly, but those images have to be good too. Something you'd actually use, you know, for a real project. Right. Yeah. Speed without quality. It's kind of like, I don't know, having a fancy sports car with no engine. Might look impressive, but it's not going to get you very far. Exactly. And that's one of the areas where stable diffusion 3.5 really shines, I think. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Stability AI. They made some really significant improvements to the core algorithms. So the images you get are just, well, better, sharper, more detailed, more realistic than ever before. So we're not just talking about making images faster. We're talking about better images, period. Absolutely. Okay. So what's changed? How do they do it? Well, one of the key improvements is in something called coherency. Coherency. Not sure I'm familiar with that term. What does that mean exactly? We're talking about AI image generation. I mean, sure, it basically means the images make sense. You know, the different parts of the image are arranged logically. There's consistency to the overall aesthetic. I see. Like in the earlier versions of stable diffusion, you might have gotten images where I don't know, things looked a bit off. Like jumbled or disjointed, a dog with three legs, or a house with a window floating in midair. Right. Right. I get it. But those kinds of errors are way less common with stable diffusion 3.5. The AI just understands those relationships between objects better. That's got to be huge, especially if you're using AI for, you know, something like graphic design or illustration. You really need those images to look professional and polished. Absolutely. You can't have, say, a website banner with weird perspective or a children's book illustration where the characters are all, you know, distorted. So these improvements to coherency, they're really bridging that gap between AI generated images and what a human would create. Exactly. And it's a trend we're seeing, you know, in AI image generation in general. It's getting harder and harder to tell the difference between what a human made and what came from a machine. Wow. That does raise all sorts of interesting questions, but I think we'll save those for another time. For now, though, I do want to talk about the safety features in stable diffusion 3.5. This has been a hot topic in the AI community, and it's really good to see stability AI taking it seriously. Yeah, for sure. AI is powerful and we need to use it responsibly. Like, right. So with stable diffusion 3.5, there's a big emphasis on preventing, well, harmful or inappropriate content from being generated. So you're saying they've built in like safeguards to stop people from using it to create things that could be offensive or dangerous. Exactly. The algorithms are trained now to recognize and flag certain kinds of imagery. And there are like systems in place to prevent those images from even being made in the first place. Can you give me some examples? What kind of imagery are they trying to block? Sure. Things like hate speech, violence, sexually explicit content. Those are all things stable diffusion 3.5 is designed to avoid. Makes sense. It's about making sure this technology is used for good, not to cause harm. Right. And it's an ongoing process, you know, as this technology changes. So will the safety features? It's that balance, right? Between pushing the boundaries and while making sure we stay within ethical lines. Like walking a tightrope almost. But we have to walk it. If we want to see AI reach its full potential. I agree. And it says a lot about stability AI that they're taking this so seriously. They're not just releasing this technology and well, hoping for the best. They're actively working to make sure it's used in a safe and responsible way. That is reassuring to hear. It's good to remember that even with cutting edge technology like this, there are humans behind it, right? Making decisions about how it gets developed and used. Absolutely. And those humans are listening to the concerns of the community, trying to address them. That's what makes open source so powerful. It's not just about making the technology available. It's about that transparency, that collaboration. Everyone has a voice in how it's shaped. Exactly. And it's that collaboration that's going to drive the success of this technology ultimately. You know, when you have all these different perspectives, different voices contributing, you end up with something much stronger. Like the old saying, two heads are better than one. Or in this case, maybe thousands of heads. Exactly. And with stable diffusion 3.5, we're seeing what that collective intelligence can do. It really is remarkable when you think about it. This incredibly powerful technology being developed out in the open. Contributions from all over the world. It's a real testament to, well, that human spirit of innovation, isn't it? It is. And it makes you wonder what other incredible breakthroughs are just around the corner. You know, waiting to be discovered by this global community. That's a great question. And I for one am excited to find out. Me too. But for now, I think we'll have to leave it there. Until next time. We've covered a lot, haven't we? All the technical stuff, the new features, the image quality improvements, the safety measures. But I think, you know, it's also important to step back. Look at the big picture. What does all this actually mean for, well, the future? How is stable diffusion 3.5 going to impact the world? Not just in AI, but beyond that. Yeah, that's a great point. And it's a question with some pretty far reaching implications, right? We're talking about tech that could. I mean, really democratize creativity, empower people in ways we haven't seen before. So it's like giving everyone a superpower then. Yeah. Being able to create whatever images they can imagine without needing years of training or, you know, tons of expensive equipment. Exactly. Imagine anyone with a story to tell a product to design or even just a message to share can now make amazing visuals to go with it. That's the power here. It's almost like, I don't know, the printing press of the 21st century. Just like the printing press change how we communicate, stable diffusion could change how we create and even just like experience visual content. And that change is already happening. We're seeing stable diffusion used in so many industries. Advertising, marketing, education, entertainment. Can you give me some examples? Like how are people actually using it? Sure. So in marketing, companies are using it to create, you know, eye catching stuff for their websites, social media, even product packaging. It lets them make unique content without needing to spend a fortune on photo shoots or graphic designs. That's huge for small businesses, startups, anyone who doesn't have the budget for a big creative team. Exactly. It levels the playing field, gives everyone access to those high quality visuals. What about education? How is it impacting how we teach and learn? Oh, it's opening up so many possibilities. Teachers are using it to create visual aids for their lessons, you know, bringing complex ideas to life in a way that students really respond to. I bet it's great for subjects like, I don't know, science and history, where being able to actually see something can make a big difference. Absolutely. And it's not just teachers making content. Students are using it to expressing their creativity, you know, exploring ideas in new ways. So it's like giving them a digital art studio right there in their classroom. Exactly. And that's really just the start. We're seeing it used in architecture design, helping professionals quickly prototype and visualize their concepts. So we're not just talking about pretty pictures. It's about, well, solving problems, driving innovation. Right. And as it keeps evolving, we're going to see even more uses, more impact. It's a pretty exciting time. It really is. But with all the positive stuff, we also need to be realistic. There are potential downsides, right? Challenges or risks that come with a technology this powerful. That's a good point. Like with any powerful tool, there's the potential for misuse, right? Right. One concern is that it could be used to create, I don't know, misleading content, deep fakes, propaganda, thing like that. That is a serious issue. We have to be aware of that. Absolutely. And that's why it's so crucial to have these open conversations, you know, think critically about the ethics, how to prevent things from going wrong. It's like with any new tech, there's a learning curve, figuring out how to use it responsibly, make sure it benefits everyone. Exactly. And that's a responsibility that falls on all of us. Developers, artists, policymakers, everyone, we got to work together to shape this tech. It's a collaborative effort, just like how stable diffusion was created. Right. And that collaboration needs to go beyond just the tech stuff. We need to be talking about the ethical, social, even the economic impacts. It's a big task. It is, but we can't ignore it. Well said. And on that note, I think it's time to wrap up our look at stable diffusion 3.5. It's been a fascinating conversation. It really has. We've talked about a lot, the technical side, the bigger societal impact. And I think the main takeaway is, well, this is just the beginning. Stable diffusion 3.5 is like a window into the future of creativity, where imagination and technology come together. And we're just getting started. The possibilities are endless. Well, that's all the time we have for today. Thanks for joining us. Be sure to visit our website, techandainews.com for more. And we'll see you next time.
