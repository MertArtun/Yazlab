 Welcome everyone to the Consulting Technology podcast. I'm John Kerr, Senior Producer at Cognacore Consulting and Research. Joined us always by our Senior Technology Researcher, Dr. Samuel Z. Today's guest is Dr. Sonco Park, Professor at the Lundquist College of Business at the University of Oregon. Son joins us on today's podcast to discuss his research, the challenges startups and consultants face in addressing technology adoption and growth in the modern startup ecosystem. Subscribe to this show now for more episodes in our Consulting Technology podcast series. Here is our conversation. Thank you for joining us. I was wondering if we could start with sharing a bit about your background and how you see the regional differences in the startup world. The US, South Korea, or other areas of Asia, the EU? Yeah. So I guess I'll start with just introducing myself a little bit. Yeah, I graduated at the University of Washington with my PhD there in Strategic Management and Technology Entrepreneurship. And afterwards I got a job at the University of Oregon currently now as an assistant professor at the College of Business. Yeah, and so I grew up in like several different countries including Korea, the US, and Europe. And so yeah, there are like very salient differences in terms of the entrepreneurial landscape. But I feel like there's a lot of convergence going on these days because of the sort of international investments going on. Like VC funds these days are funding like internationally and not limited to certain geographies. And so there is a lot of convergence. But at the same time, I think the heterogeneity really lies in like the language that they use. For instance, like in Korean VC firms or like Korean startups, because their language is sort of confined to like sort of Korean as a language, the startups there are basically catering to like just the people who are able to speak that language. And in the case of like USVCs or US startups, of course, like because English is more internationally like utilized and like widely known, their reach is measured. And so yeah, that's overall take for me. Of course, we can go into much more like granular differences, but at a higher level, I'll leave it at that. Thank you. What are the key areas of research or technology trends you're currently focused on? Is it startups? Yeah. And so right now I've been looking to startups. So just to preface, like I'm not like a AI expert, but this is an area that I'm increasing my sort of research efforts into. And so yeah, I personally enjoy coding in my own time and sort of reading up different like computer science papers, especially around like our language models and and leave. Yeah. So the startup landscape these days for AI specifically, I feel has been like evolving like drastically. And so a lot of research has been around like the impact of being in like the right industry at the right time. And we know a lot of evidence from like past strategic management studies that show like industry category and time is really important and is responsible for a sizable chunk of the variance and the outcomes of ventures in terms of their funding or whether it growth or other types of performance metrics. And right now AI is probably sort of the hottest in terms of like being in the right industry at the right time. And so I'm seeing a lot more like AI focused companies. If you look at sort of, for instance, like I believe the Y Combinator, one of the leading accelerators, their recent batches consisted of a large chunk of like AI based startups. They're focusing on that. And so yeah, I think that sort of startup landscape right now is really focusing on a lot of different like AI, how the outcome will be liked. But what I find really interesting is whether sort of these technologies kind of benefit like large companies or startups. So but differently is Generative AI or AI in general going to be democratizing or polarizing technology. Is it going to like benefit certain types of firms more than others because of their unique resource endowments? Or is it going to help all players and sort of level the playing field? And so yeah, that's sort of my take on the current start. Yeah, so some in terms of just startup companies in general, at the beginning of their life, lifeblood or the beginning of their time, is there any particular advice that's more general that you could offer before we dive into details about just how a startup company can be successful? We'll go through some of the kind of findings from some of your research later, but just any big takeaways overall about say a new startup company, particularly the tech field or a technology related area that you could offer as either more growth related device or who they should be reaching out to as say mentorships or things like that. So any particular trends you see that successful startups all kind of share in that early early stage? Yeah, I think successful startups use a good combination of like sort of their own intuition, which we like in academics call like the theory that they build up and also the sort of data that they retrieve from experimentation. So having a good combination or like a good sort of portfolio of activities that is consistent of experimenting, meaning that they're questioning what they believe or what they're seeing, they really verify and test these sort of assumptions that they're holding. But at the same time, not being too rigorous or like approaching this from very scientific approach that becomes too rigid, there needs to be more flexibility in these sort of individuals who are able to excel, I feel, are able to be more, they're more like imaginative, they can sort of generate new ideas, create new ideas that might at the time of the idea generation be radical or a little like counterintuitive, but that's necessary for startups to succeed. So in a healthy startup that is able to grow, I see a good balance between that data driven approach of using experimentation, continuous trial and error of like correcting themselves through hypothesis testing, but at the same time being a little imaginative and thinking of thinking things around like what's possible, but what doesn't seem to be too feasible. And so being a little bit more creative really helps. So I think a good startup that succeeds or like at a very high level is able to push through those early like difficulties, strikes a nice balance between experimenting more about more of the logical rational approach and also being more creative or generative. And so yeah, that's sort of my overall take. I know it's very broad, but yeah, that's sort of my take. Yeah. So in terms of the kinds of technologies you see, you mentioned LLMs and we're course in this kind of generative AI, either investment cycle or hype cycle, everyone put it right now. If you look at, they say the next five years down the line, you're even up to 10 years, we will go that far out. I assume that's too far out for most academic researchers. But in the areas of research that I'm at least familiar with, it does seem like we're seeing particular technologies that are just finding a lot more adoption than others. Like I could say, for example, we kind of went through that dip in the blockchain community a few years ago, especially when like FTX stuff had their kind of large collapse and things of this nature. Of course, Meta is investing right a lot right now in the AR, VR space, things like this. But is there any particular technologies you want to call out as in the next, say, five years, those will be today's version of the LLM or whatever's being the highest amount of investment at this time right now? Yeah, so if I were able to correctly predict the specific technology, that would be great. But I do see like, OK, so my take is that compared to other forms of AI that have existed for a long time now, throughout the winter and so forth, I feel like generative AI, which does include LLMs, but also includes all other forms of generative artificial intelligence, is really different because this time around, these technologies helps you build compared to like other forms of AI previously, we're really much more focused on analytical predictions and optimization. And so the difference that this generative AI makes in terms of helping you build completely changes sort of the startup landscape, because the introduction of generative AI now has shifted who can be an entrepreneur now, especially in like the software space since sort of the bar for development, software development specifically has gone down dramatically. If you're not a technical founder, you don't now need to find a technical co-founder to get you kickstarted, at least in the first sort of month. Later on, of course, you'll need that. But in the sort of kickstarting stage, you won't need that. You'll just consult Patrick BT or other forms of LLM to get that very bare minimum code in place. And so this is already happening. And I can sort of share evidence from like YC's recent batch. It consists of 30% who are just students who do not have any work experience. They're college students. And this number is a large increase from the prior batches from a couple of years ago prior to LLMs. And what this is sort of showing or reflecting is that the bar to entrepreneurship is becoming lower thanks to the introduction of these sort of AI that helps you build stuff as opposed to, you know, just optimizing analytics or prediction. Because like predicting is helpful, but it doesn't help you build a product, right? But generated AI can definitely help you build something, something tangible, something that you can sell or like export and so forth. And so I feel like that is in the next five to 10 years is going to be transformative in who becomes an entrepreneur who might have not become one because of those technological barriers. And so I think it's a fascinating technology. And I feel like we'll be seeing other forms of generative AI other than large language models. And I think you'll have similar benefits to entrepreneurs who have aspirations or ideas to build some sort of product or service, but don't know how to because of their lack of technical expertise. 24 2025 will be the year of the solar solo. Paneur, I've heard that from multiple groups a few different times. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, definitely. I think that's the case. And my hunch is that we'll see a huge variance in the quality of startups because of that, because like you will have like really proficient people using AI to further excel. But at the same time, you'll be seeing like people who barely like scrape by in terms of technology or their ideation also entering the space. And so you'll see a huge variance. Maybe the number wrong number of startups will go up drastically. But at the same time, an increasing number of startups will fail because they're not tested or vetted and so forth. Sure. Sure. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So as both Johnny and I know, a large number of our listeners are not only entrepreneurs and folks in the startup space, but they're consultants who provide services to sort of companies and groups like this. Is there any particular types of either value or services that you think, at least right now in this kind of current age, that consulting firms either should be offering or what are the types of services or value that at least consultants should be offering startups right now? What are the kind of skills that startups are looking to hire from consultants at this time? Yeah. So you're asking from a startup's perspective, right? From a startup's perspective, yeah. Founder of a startup and you want to hire other consultants for you to do some business or some tasks that you don't want to do yourself. Well, yeah, the way I see it, once again, I'm going to bring in Generative AI because I feel like that's the theme for today, at least for me. Generative AI has really changed the space, I feel, because for general, very shallow knowledge, I feel like the role of consultants might be threatened in that sense. But I think where consultants provide a lot of value and distinct value that these Generative AI's can't is in being like really providing deep and narrow knowledge. Now, I don't know what that exactly will be like in more of the conferee terms, but I feel like consultants should act like small language models, basically focusing on higher quality data, much more narrow data that is hard to get that at the same time, really, really critical and deep knowledge that permeates the entire organization that large language models simply can't because at least the way that the data is created in many purposes used by a lot of these large language model providers, they aspire to provide general knowledge. Of course, there will be some depth, but it will be wider than it's deeper. And so I feel like even though I don't know too much about the consulting industry myself, I feel like that's sort of the next stage or step that the consultants have to take. For them to sort of become useful for startups. And so to answer your question about like what services is valuable for startups, particularly that's a difficult question because I haven't been sort of like looking to the interaction between consultants and startups and their needs. But I think that's sort of the punch that I have in that if you're a startup looking for some consultancy, you won't be looking for general level guidance anymore because of the introduction of AI or Gen AI more specifically, you'll be looking for very, very specific knowledge that you cannot get through these large language models. And so that's, I know it might not be helpful, but sort of that's my high level take. Yeah. No, no, that makes sense. I mean, I've heard some more things from startup kind of entrepreneurs saying that, well, now, you know, accountants, attorneys, people have legal expertise, people have kind of compliance expertise, become more valuable because they can do a lot of the engineering and the kind of more product management kind of traditional business side consulting work with an LLM using it as their assistant. But you still have to have and at the end of the day, some experts, some attorney, some, you know, tax expert, whatever, you know, financial expert, whatever they are, signing the documents help you, you know, illegally create the company, help you legally find funding, help you legally, you know, pay your taxes or make sure you're in compliance or things like this. So I've heard a lot of kind of startup folks say that the one area that they now are practicing more is this kind of legal tax financial side of things, and pretty much what they used to. Yeah, I agree. I agree. And especially like these sort of like specialists, I think the network that they provide to right, like if you have a tax attorney, like they're not just doing your job, but they provide you advice and they provide you with further connections and other like domains that you might need help in. And so I think like these soft skills, they're becoming even more important for consultants because like LLMs or AI can't provide that sort of connections, right? Yeah. And so I think these soft skill sets are surprisingly becoming more important for these people who generally tend to provide very high quality specialized knowledge. Sure, sure. Well, let's jump into a few of your articles that you've worked on in your research areas. You had an article particular called RSEED Accelerators Status Springboards for startups or sand traps. This article in particular, you mentioned how accelerators are essentially impacting startups and things like this. Can you give some insights on, you know, particular maybe other particular geo locations that startups should look at when choosing, say, accelerators or how are accelerators impacting startups? Are they always helping them? Or are there some negatives associated with them as well? Yeah, yeah. So I think this is the research being currently conducted. A large chunk of the research right now, at least in terms of accelerators are looking at into their positive mechanisms that enable them to work. But in some certain studies, for instance, by Sandy, you, they do see that there it might not be effective under certain circumstances, but net looking across many different accelerators, they do seem to have positive effects. And so if you look at my study with my co authors, there's quite a bit of variance across different accelerators in how effective it is for the sort of graduates in terms of finding high status investors. Now, high status investors are investors who are well connected and sort of your sort of usual go to names, including Andreessen Orowitz or Sequoia Capital all these big and so it's really important because like these more higher status investors provide you with better networks, better resources, better knowledge and so right. It's increasing your likelihood of growing further succeeding as a startup basically if you're like, linked to or get funding from these high status investors. And our study sort of looks into how there's a lot of variance across accelerators in like how some are effective in providing you with a sort of better experience, meaning that they'll help you lead to higher status investors after your graduates, whereas others are less so and so it becomes really important. But if you see sort of the study in a graph that we have sort of portrayed, you'll see that there's a lot of variance across regions. And so it's not a region specific thing. And so it's really more specific to the brand, if you can say, but even within the same brands, for instance, like Techstars, there's quite a bit of variance. And I think there needs to be more work done into why certain branches of the same accelerator are working more effectively than others. But this is once again, still an area that is currently being like a lot of work is going into this area. And one of the biggest sort of research agendas right now in accelerators, at least in management and entrepreneurship is understanding where the heterogeneity lies. Some accelerators are really helpful, others are not so much others have no effect meaning it doesn't really help you at all, it doesn't make a difference whether you enroll or not. And so there's so many reasons why that could be the case. Some could be because of the sort of design, it may be designed in a way that helps you learn. Others might be like it provides you with a better networking opportunity or provides you with better knowledges and so forth. And so this sort of source of heterogeneity is still under research. And yeah, I can't provide you with a concrete answer regarding that. Sure, sure, that makes sense. So even if there are potential pitfalls, right now, it seems like you're saying it's pretty random, we know there's no really way to guarantee that going to, you know, joining any particular accelerator or just joining all accelerators you can will guarantee a positive outcome, things like that. It's pretty up in the air. Yes, but some of the more famous ones as you sort of can predict including Y Combinator or like Techstars, they are pretty helpful as you can see their effect is like it effect is highly positive. They will get you a investor of a much more renowned investor compared to non-enrolling them. And so yeah, those brands are highly effective. I'm assuming that has some kind of snowball effect where once you get one of these kind of big brand names, it's easier to get other big brand names and things like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, affiliation, right? Like if you graduate from Y Combinator, of course, these investors will sort of look at you differently because there's so many startups nowadays, you need that certification to at least start out us stand out in the first sort of evaluation phase. Sure, sure, make sense. We have another article called How Predictable is Exceptional Venture Growth. Looks like you use machine learning, predict, unicorn venture outcomes. With this particular article and the research around it that you've seen since then, is there any particular mechanisms that startups should do when they're either in accelerators or on their own to signal that they are a good quality investment to potential investors? Is there either is going to an accelerator always signaling well to potential investors or they're good at high quality investment? Or are there other kind of things that startups should be looking at doing to kind of signal that they are ready to take on high quality and look for potentially high quality investors? Yeah, yeah, I think that's a difficult question because we initially, at least when we were studying this thought that participating in accelerators on average might not be helpful because if you are a startup and your product is solid and you're ready, you don't really need to enroll in accelerators because they take further equity, like you lose that chunk of equity that you give up. And you also have to sort of abide by their rules and sort of like their own like timeline milestones. And that might be distracting if you already have a working product and that's going to that's gaining a lot of traction, you can go straight to high status investors because if your product's working, it's gaining a lot of traction, you don't need this sort of, I guess, stepping stone. But yeah, that doesn't necessarily seem to be the case. And so yeah, I think in general, like if you are just enrolling in these programs that itself is a huge signal. That's a huge positive signal. Now, your question is like, what more can you do to stand out even if you are like in an accelerator, you want to stand out from your own batch. Now, that's a difficult question. I don't have an answer to. But one thing I always go back to is the importance of traction, like even if you're enrolling in Y Combinator, like traction is pretty critical because that's a precursor for growth, right? If you have traction and like repeated like measures of like you gaining popularity in terms of your product, then that's sort of the most important thing, regardless of whether you enroll in these sort of accelerator programs or not. And so even in these programs, I think it's important for you to move the point, like you can't really rely solely on that signal that you have graduated from a prestigious accelerator, right? And so although it may seem like kind of a logical pretty straightforward common sense answer, I think that's sort of the key takeaway, at least from my studies in that traction is very critical. And that's sort of the thing that you should be for. Sure, that makes sense. Also in this article, it looks like you use some form of machine learning. I saw some notion of K-Full cross validation, for example, in the article. Can you explain a little bit how maybe machine learning is either improving the predictability of venture growth or how machine learning is kind of changing the landscape to venture capital investing research and things like that? Yeah, yeah. So in this specific study, we compare more like simple or more traditional models, including like logistical regression, which is very simple in terms of like the model itself. And we compare it to more, I guess, advanced or more sophisticated models like tree based models, random forest and so forth, XG boost. And so basically, what we're trying to do is do these more sophisticated machine learning models that's taken to the complexity amongst the variables and sort of the interrelation between these variables. And are these more complex models able to better predict the outcomes when it comes to long term growth outcomes, which we're looking into the valuation, the company. So we're basically predicting whether a early stage company that just received their funding, their first round of VC funding becomes a unicorn venture or not, unicorn venture meeting, it has a private valuation of $1 billion. And what we're seeing is, yes, compared to the more simple traditional logistic models, or even just the random model where you basically predict randomly which one's going to be a unicorn, yes, the predictive power is much more higher, like two to three X. But if you look at the absolute number, even for these more advanced models, you can only predict around like 2.4 out of 10 startups accurately. Now that might be a good number, but at the same time, it's still not like a number that says, wow, we've solved growth, right? And so our sort of conclusion is a little like, it's up to interpretation, and it's not like super like, wow, inducing in that we can predict eight out of 10 using more sophisticated models. And so the conclusion here is that because startups go through such a convoluted process, and the process of growth itself is multifaceted, it's really going to be almost impossible to predict long term growth outcomes, even using machine learning models that are able to take into account the non linearity of the variables, or once again, the interaction between these variables. And so that's a high level takeaway. And in terms of machine learning being used in research itself, I think a big trend these days is using machine learning to build there. Now in the past, theory that you want to test using hypotheses, we're just built based on you doing literature reviews, where you read a bunch of different studies that have been done, and sort of like deducing your way to a better hypothesis like you want to test. But using machine learning, you can sort of once again, pattern match and sort of look into the data that might you might not catch looking through these sort of literature abuse, right? And so that's one way that machine learning is being used in current research and strategic management entrepreneurship, which is basically using machine learning to inductively sort of look at what patterns are arising and theorizing that way. So it's a much more data driven theorizing or like approach compared to more of the like past literature review based sort of theorizing. Yeah, that's really interesting that even with, you know, using these kind of advanced techniques and having academics we work on this data for a while that 20 being only only pre will predict 25% or 2.4 out of 10. Yeah, positive outcomes is pretty low, right? That's very interesting. You're had another paper and also just I know your own personal background of working and living internationally quite a bit on the different regions in the role of geography and access to startup capital. We have a lot of listeners to this show that are international folks who are they working to start up space and things like that. Is there any particular way that you could recommend to these individuals that, you know, if they are say, and, you know, maybe developing countries or different parts of the world and things like this, you know, especially given the rise of remote work and just kind of what we see since post post kind of COVID pandemic here, is there any kind of recommendations you'd give folks like this in terms of who are looking for say startup capital or looking for ways to find investors for their startup company, especially if they're from these, you know, different regions that are going to be outside of our kind of local space? Yeah, yeah, I think so I'm no expert in sort of international entrepreneurship. But my take is that, um, like the language that you're using to build a product really either can limit or like free free yourself, like, so for instance, if you're using a very niche language, basically, that's limiting your target markets to the people who are sort of using that language, right? And so the benefit of using English here becomes like very evident that your market becomes highly global. And that's why a lot of like, apps were able to succeed from like smaller countries or different countries, because they were basically using English as the sort of basic language to develop the apps and or the software or the hardware or whatever that be. And so in the case of one being in a country where there isn't that much startup capital, one way to sort of think about it is like, think about like, who your target audience is. And if it's very regional, then once again, you're limiting your abilities to gain that capital, because whoever the funders are are going to be interested in only like the low stuff. And so if you can like, more straightforward, I guess, if you are in other countries that don't speak English, I guess it's better to build apps that do use English, because you get a whole lot more opportunities that way. If you look at a set of accelerators these days, a lot of the companies are international, it's not just the US startups are enrolling in these top top accelerator programs. And so one way my advice would be if you are in like a different country that might not use English, find a way to leverage the English language and sort of build your products and the English language, or maybe hire somebody who is able to help you out with the language stuff, and apply to these sort of like prestigious programs in the US, because they'll help you like find different networks that you were never able to gain access to. And you'll only need to stay in these accelerator programs if you do enroll in one for three months. And so that's very easy to do using a lot of like more relaxed visas, you don't need like work visa to enroll in these programs for this specific purpose. And so yeah, I think that's one opportunity that's pretty straightforward, but people like discount because it's so obvious, but that's one thing I've been noticing looking at regional startups versus more like international startups. That's a fantastic tip. Thank you. Is it okay to share your research in the show notes? If I could link to your scholar page? Yeah, of course. Yes. I think our viewers will love that. We run a companion podcast to the consulting technology podcast called the Cognac catch up. And it's gaining quite a bit of traction, because people like having this sort of access to cutting edge news and events. And I think I'd love to give our audience the treat of maybe hearing some insights about a recent project you've worked on, or something that's happening now in your life that has particularly excited you. Yeah, I'd love to talk about I hate too big things in terms of research. It was exciting in my life and research pretty much overlaps a lot. So yeah, I'll talk about two interesting research projects. The first one is really looking to how the VCs themselves have changed over time. Now VCs have been at least in the US around for a long time. And what we've been sort of noticing recently with my co authors is that the VCs themselves have been changing in terms of their main logics that they sort of portray or like, use to like invest and basically do their day to day operations. In the past, they were really much more like financiers who are focused on like return on investments. Basically, they were acting like banks or professional like finance, sort of organizations, but these and they were much loosely structured in order. But these days, you'll see them being very professional. They have different departments specializing in certain tasks, not just investing, but also operational. At the same time, overall, we're seeing the trend that they're much more founder friendly. In the past, because these monopolists had the resources, basically the money, they were always at the top in terms of the power dynamics compared to the founders. But these days, we don't know exactly why, but there seems to be shift in the power dynamic between the VC and the founders, maybe there's excess abundance of capital. And so VCs are competing against each other to find the better deal. We don't know exactly why, but a lot of the VCs are becoming much more founder friendly and sort of supporting the founders instead of like using them or like trying to make this just an investment opportunity. And so you'll see a lot of evidence around like, see the founders being retained as CEOs for a much longer time than in the past. And there is a lot more like opportunities that the VC provides for the founders to be nurtured, and to be sort of going achieving growth themselves. So this is an interesting research projects that looked into how VCs themselves have been changing. And so we all have the results for a while. And so I can't tell you what the verdict is, but that's one project we've been working on. Another one I have been working on is really understanding when data analytics is useful for startups. Now, there's a whole plethora of different like data analytics, including the more conventional ones such as Google Analytics to more sophisticated ones that are niche. But in general, I was curious, like for what sort of product markets are data analytics effective for startups? And so I guess, sort of the verdict here or the simple takeaway is that there's differences in market, right? In some product markets, the sort of demand is much more clearer. There's more key players that are well known and the logics to success are very clear. And these are more established markets, like say, for instance, smartphones. And on the other side of spectrum, there are markets that are much more vague ambiguous, where there's unclear customer demand because it's so new. And the logics to success to sort of dominating market is much more unclear. And this includes things like virtual real life. And so I was curious, what sort of product market spaces is data analytics more useful for? And so I find that data analytics are more useful in markets like for smartphones, basically more conventional ones that have been more established. On the other hand, of course, less useful in markets like virtual reality, or the more less conventional spaces basically. And sort of the rationale I hear is that data analytics results can contain a lot more noise in markets that are ambiguous or less established and thus less conventional. And so these other data captured from these data analytics tool reflects these customers or other stakeholders that are not sure what they want or need in such markets, because like in VR, like me as a customer, I don't know what I want as a VR product, I don't know what's the best product for me, because I've never experienced this is such a new space, I'm exploring my own like needs and wants to and so the data analytics sort of reflects this ambiguity or uncertainty. So basically, in quantifiable forms, it's just basically creating a lot of noise that's hard to interpret from the startup's perspective. And so venture is really struggle to interpret the confusing or the conflicting insights generated by these data analytics. And so yeah, that's the conclusion that I come to. And this is supported by the fact that we know from prior studies that in these markets that are more unconventional like the VR market, entrepreneurs require much more hands on approach, meaning that they need to go out to the people to persuade them to persuade that this is a legitimate market that is ripe for a growth or there is going to be enough demand. And so this sort of activity of persuasion is much more important than you sort of just simply looking at the analytics, seeing what it's telling you and implementing action, it shouldn't work like that. So these two are the big projects that I've been working on lately and I'm really excited. Once again, these two are both ongoing projects. And so I don't have definite conclusions about this as much as I can reveal. I sincerely hope that we get an opportunity to talk to you again in the future to hear the progress of your studies. It's really exciting. I'm sorry. Oh, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for sharing that with us. Do you have any social media that you'd like to plug or anything that you're currently doing that you'd like to share a link with for our listeners? So I don't really do social media. And so I have no real social media presence in any of them. Thank you so much for joining us on the Consulting Technology podcast and we wish you the best. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
