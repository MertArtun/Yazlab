 You can see from short distance away with your naked human eye, that's some of them appear to be very precise. And then polish to a level, precision that it hears to potentially the machining itself. So if these were cut or carved, and then polished, well, they look ultra-precise, and to a normal person, some of them look almost perfect. The pervidence or when exactly these things were originally found, we don't know. This one is attributed to Nikata. So it's considered to be Nikata based. And I got that one with the College of Beaford, the Egyptian College of just started basically. These look special. They don't seem to be made by the people that they're ascribed to. Those people don't seem to have had the technology to do them. There's no evidence of that. They seem to be in possession of them, however. And so is there a way we can take a look at these objects to see if there's any information we can extract from them. But when I thought I had a few that seemed like they were, I had one of them scanned by a representative of a defense industry contractor. A plate is then cut and parallel with the ground. So these are different planes we sliced. We sliced and we created an artificial plane. Looked at all the points along that particular plane. Calcutta is standard deviation of each point from that prefix circle. That computer dropped generates and says if they were going for a perfect circle, how close do they get? How good is this relative? And here we can see the interior next area. We're almost to see. Right, to about the scene. Now every point's a little bit different. So this is 12 microns. This is 16 microns. These points are probably an inch apart. But two centimeters apart from each other. Yeah, so 16 microns is 0.016 millimeters. That's fine and sane. That's right. Hi everyone.

Covering costs like equipment and travel. Thanks again for being here and I'm excited to keep bringing you more great content and discoveries. But now let's jump back to the show. Adam Young. Welcome in Switzerland. I'm glad you waited to hear. Carol, if thank you. Thank you. Actually, we are flying to London today. Yes, we are. The Petium Museum. We will have some projects to do there. But I really wanted to sit down with you to talk about ancient precision ways. It's hard stone ways. And your entire journey with this project and this topic started. When did you do you realize these things are interesting? How did it start? I didn't realize it. This was shown to me and explained to me by archaeologists, both professionally and amateur in Egypt. I saw these first-hand 10 years ago or more. I had heard from locals via being in the museum and seeing these pieces on display. Back down there were at that many of them and it wasn't regarded as something that's special. But there are people that are always war people that were talking about these. I think this had gone back to the age of Petrie in the late 1800s and beyond. But guides in Egypt like Muhammad Ibrahim, Yusuf, Ouyran and then what I met Robert Schak, Dr. Robert Schak, a boss in university. They mentioned things about these days. And even over the Chuck, Dr. Robert Schak. He too. I thought he's moving on a completely different he is. But he's a geologist. And so any object that's made in stone is going to be adventurous to him, especially if you recognize the type of stil with igneous rockets. It's something that he studied for many years. Cheers. And so the common sort of themes were that there are these objects in Egypt other than the pyramids and the great monumental works of construction that are of interest as well. However, their museums, we don't really know where they are. No ones ever studied and randomized. So after being in Egypt in the cities when I returned home back to the states, my wife and I started looking for these objects, my thought was if no one else has analyzed them, that's interesting. If they're hard to find, that's interesting. But turns out they were all that hard to find and you could find these online for sale via various auction houses and just heart brokers like antiquities dealers would commonly have these things listed on their website for sale because they weren't that popular. They weren't that common. They weren't that expensive. See, they weren't that rare. They were common. They were common and they weren't that expensive for a long period of time. And so I thought, well, at the very least, this is a piece of, you know, potentially prehistoric or pre-diynastic history would be very cool to own a piece of that but not really, I'm not driven by, I'm not a collector, I'm not a hoarder necessarily. But I thought it's some point to be nice to have enough of these and do some actual real work or collaborate with others that could. And so after finding a few of them, I had, I had many of them, but they're not all, all high interest. They're not all of, of high quality or accurate to what we're going to talk about today. But when I thought I had a few that seemed like they were, I had one of them scanned by a representative of a defense industry contractor that was demoing, demonstrating, and also selling structured light-skating devices. Representative of gold, which is now owned by ZICE, but it used to be an independent company. So they made a number of skaters. They have this blue laser light, which you might see in the form of a rectangular, these to be, I think like a reddish rectangular box at the spin, be mounted on some sort of a stand of an apparatus yet stand and then there'd be a little rotating table or something that that it could scan. Sometimes you'd see the arm aperture move around and then there is larger devices, the size of a room or a small car that they had as well. And if I'm not mistaken, I need to keep ensuring the data points by projecting laser matrix on the object and hold these lines in the matrix is deformed. It's calculating the points and how these stand they are from the cameras. Right. And so it takes all those data points. It puts them into its own internal three-dimensional coordinates as a matter of a touch of some other metrics as well. And that file can be exported as a common file that you can then read into a variety of programs. There's proprietary programs that correspond to some of the different pieces of electronics. Each company might make the real proprietary system. But then you can also use free versions like blender. It's an open source system. You can create custom scripting to make your work in your Alice's faster. But there's different ways you can analyze the three-dimensional coordinates system once it's there. Right. You want it to be in three-dimensional cartoon, effectively, space, XYZ play. Which allows you to measure distances to look at three-dimensional geometry. How round is this round feature? It looks round, but is it round? How round is it relative to a perfect circle or a sphere or a cylinder? How flat is something? What's the deviation in his elevation or lipid? What was so interesting about these phases? It should capture your attention. You can see from short distance away with your naked human that's some of them appear to be very precise. And then polish to a level precision that it hears to potentially the machining itself. So these were cutter carved and then polished. Well, they look ultra-precise and to a normal person. Some of them look almost perfect. This looks like it was machined. Like it came out of a machine shop off of a assembly line. You know, some sort of some sort of operation that resulted in just creating the levels of precision. And they also don't correspond to other things you see in museums. They look a lot different than the majority of things found in any museum anywhere. From anything going back before like, let's say, at the 16 or 1700. So they stand out as being unique. Clearly high level and then poultry. Clearly a higher level than pottery. Although some pottery does look round, some of it was made in a pottery wheel. It's not finished to a level of accuracy that aligns with a geometric shape. This is your piece, right? Yeah, this is one of them. And so a lot of them were dated to a time before diagnostic Egypt. Dynastic Egypt is what most historians and textbooks would refer to as the first time in human history we had a number of things. Like a written spoken, you know, well built out language like systems of government, like systems of processes for doing everything from building to archiving trade to managing labor, to taxation, even like financial contracts. That stuff is as summary in an Egyptian typically. And there's not much else before that. We don't know what else before that. And what we do know, and we have talking about roughly 3,000 BC. So typically the the the the Dynasties, the early kingdoms in Egypt would have started around 32, 33, 3400 BC. Sometimes it's referred to as the archaic period. But generally that's the formation of Ancient Egypt. And Samaria is sometimes going back a little bit further. But generally that's the formation of like human history as we know it. That's the that's when the recorded history really for starts and is preserved. So we don't have human written history that goes back before that any longer. It's been destroyed. It's been lost. It may be never was there or it wasn't there for a period of time. So these are dated by archaeologists and they are regarded to be older than the Dynastic Egypt. Or early Dynastic sometimes. Sometimes into the first few Dynasties, yes. But as far back officially as 4, 5000 BC. And that's because of where they were found. So a lot of you found in up and down Egypt. So we have upper Egypt and lower Egypt. Petri was excavating throughout the late 1800s. There are early 1900s. He excavated a lot of sites. Many other people did too. With Egyptologists, in there's Petri. If you're a human being European, each Turkeyologist, right? He was nothing. He was English. But there was other there was there was there's French German Austrians Belgian. They were all over Europe. They were in Egypt. And actually does the museum very early next week. That's his museum or a decolrectional fees findings. Yeah. It sounds like a lot of the pieces were brought back by him or others and then donated later. So you know you have this concept of of Victorian era archaeology. This was, it was a new thing. It was, it was a fascination by Europeans. Egypt was a fascination. Right. So a lot of things were brought out of Egypt and brought out of other countries. We know about obelisk sort of large things that were stood up. And I live in New York. There's one in New York. What probably the smallest one? But it's still impressive. Some of these are enormous. And they were successfully brought out of Egypt legally or for lack of a better term. In accordance with the authorities in Egypt at the time. So a lot of antiquities have been removed for Egypt over the years. And you know, Petri, his background was in survey. So he was in a metrologist by trade, but close enough he was a survey. He was a technical person. And he recognized how precise the workmanship, the craftsmanship, I guess, is in Egypt. He documented things like contours and elevations and metrics with respect to pyramids and these bowls as well. He was everywhere in Egypt. He was the first archaeologist who started to look at things from the technical perspective or engineering perspective. Probably one of the first probably. And he did a good job of documenting his efforts. Not fire the use of photographs as much he would take some on occasion, but he documented his efforts up and down Egypt. So he's credited with the communication, the transparency of a lot of the information. So others that followed it is footsteps. I think a lot of times they regard it him as a, you know, one of the first great technical archaeologists in Egypt, these are colleges. You know, so what sort of documentation do we have other than, you know, from him? Well, it hit, it really started in the, I would say the lady to Glendard's Baby mid, but generally lady to Glendard's into the 1900s in today. The 1960s, also there was a lot of work done, but in the earlier period, you have to car on the step pyramid that that was excavated for, you know, 80 to 90 years at least. And then whatever can be for that. So things that we're not documented that we're not official. In Egypt, you have a long history of antiquities collecting and for resell. So families in Egypt would commonly have store houses or warehouses either on their property or off site where things were found and then placed for resell later on. Right. So if you're going to steal a bunch of things that that theft and maybe recognize are recorded by the authorities, you don't want to be selling everything immediately, you may want to wait. And if you have longevity and your family history, you can maybe afford to wage generations before that stuff is offloaded. So I think I believe, and I don't think this is controversial. That most of the antiquities in Egypt, most of the things that you see or that you don't see, we're not excavated or recovered through official means. And so they weren't necessarily documented. It wasn't always theft because sometimes there were no laws regarding this, but you're not necessarily documenting everything if you're playing as they just keep it for few generations itself. So I think most of the archaeological record is on documented. Since then, is it probably able to bring out anything like this from Egypt? Now you can't bring very much out at all. Maybe nothing. I don't, I'm not positive, but there are various treaties that the Egyptian government put in place. So depending on the type of material it is, where it came from, where it was found, you could export things up to a certain date. And so if you can document that something was brought out before the date of a treaty, then you can keep it in its legal, and if you did it after the fact that it's illegal, and it can be claimed by customs every day, not every day, but constantly today. Customs of forcement agencies all around the world see as antiquities objects. I was just reading an article that someone had 200 objects in one back. And it wasn't by the Egyptian customs, it was by a different, I think European, it might have been an in-lear or some other country. And so this stuff is still, this stuff is still enforced. Egypt does make claims against certain artifacts occasionally when something appears, and they know about it, it's been on the radar screen. We're mostly talking about statues, we're talking about larger objects, sometimes smaller objects. And I think now, you'll see, create in other hard stone objects that they're working on. But for a long time, these were not regarded as particularly important partly because they were dated to before dinastic Egypt. Let it you get this. This was from, I think I've talked about this a few times, but the ambassadors and dignitaries and the kind of political correspondence, if you will, between European countries and Egypt may serve in Egypt at a consulate for a period of time, they would bring these back with them, often in 1800s, in the 1900s, and then up until the last few treaties in Egypt were enacted. So this came from a diplomatic collection. I believe it was brought out. And I don't know exactly, it was a window, the diplomat lived and worked in Egypt from the 30s into the 40s. And so I'm not sure exactly what he brought it out. But there's records of it, there's a trade myth, there's manifest that show that he brought it out, and he has documentation around it to avoid being accused of theft, they ain't late. So that's the province. The providence or when exactly these things were originally found, we don't know. This one is attributed to Nikata. So it's considered to be in Nikata days. Nagada was the culture before the Egyptian culture just started, basically. That was the pre-Cursor civilization, but because of the culture. Yeah, one of them. So there was many cultures. One of the, yeah, one of the closest ones, it was predominantly an upper Egypt. So that's the region around Luxor. Kind of, if you're looking at a map of Egypt, it would be in between lower Egypt, which is a chirore area, and then Nubia. So something in the middle. Yeah, this considered upper Egypt. It occurs with a full of an island. And I'll flow as north or down. So lower Egypt is north, upper Egypt is middle or south. And then the northern, now what's stood in, a lot of that was this Nubian region that then obuts or touches into upper Egypt. So Nikata was this culture that inhabited a series of sites, a series of areas, geography, that's been several hundred miles. And so there's a number of different excavation sites that were done and then attributed to the Nikata culture. Nikata as a culture, I think is roughly maybe 4500 BC. I'm not sure if it was as early as 5,000 BC, but I've seen 4500, 40. So I think in Egypt, in the Nubian Museum, we have seen those artifacts from the Nikata culture dated back to around 4,500 or something. Yeah, the egg, the Nubian egg. Yes, that was 45, right? Something like, yeah, 45, 47. I will look it up. So yeah, it's hard. I don't know if we can put a specific date on when that culture. If it was carbon dated, we could, but I don't know which one or which grave was carbonated at all. Yeah, neither do I. So Nikata culture, they're really famous for these clay or effectively baked river clay pottery. And they're painted in these designs that recur, there's these recurring themes in their designs the way they display hills and mountains and rivers. The bottom usually are black, basically. Sometimes a lot of the rocks are black. They seem to resemble some of these stolen vessels. So in the Katopaterines, you know, I would consider an emulation or an imitation of what they may have thought was in earlier form. And so they're making pottery that in some cases, mimics the design of these of certain stone vessels recurring forms we see in the stone vessels over and over again. They're seemingly imitating them and dramatically less precise material clay. And you can see it across the room, you can see that the clay, pot the top is not parallel with the ground. They don't seem to be whatever the intentional shape is. They don't seem to be perfect geometry. So, you know, it was that imitation, I would say probably. Now, we have stone tools that are attributed to a lot of these cultures and they've found stone workshops, archaeologists have found stone workshops and dated them through different means back as far as several hundreds of thousand BC. There's stolen workshops that are, I think widely accepted to be 50 to 55,000. Yes, now I don't know how you would date a stolen workshop. But what I mean by the stolen workshop is a building or a series of structures or buildings where a high volume of stone tools were seemingly made in one place. So you'll see if it was a, if they were flaking off pieces of, let's say, Flint or another object like that, you may see remnants, built up in a large quantity indicating a lot of these tools are made in one place. So when you say workshop, I think you just mean an area where the tools are made. But these officially belongs to the polyolithic time, right? So it's not, it's a very before the Nagela culture. And all the red cultures, which we have. But yeah, you could have a stone workshop that's that's used over many different years, my many different cultures. And the dating is going to be looking at their earliest date. So it could be reused by many people. And this is Egypt where then then the Nile Valley is regarded to be inhabited for hundreds of thousands of years. So, you know, there's one river, that's the lifeblood of this entire region. People all live around the river. It's only natural for many places to be re-enhabited many times. You know, so back to your question, I think, you know, I didn't know these were seemingly of various qualities and some of the qualities were fantastic that the fire explanation. I didn't know that I just felt like these are special and they seemed like they were made by a different time and a different culture. I think the late Antoni West started to talk about these us, precise things. Jonathan he wasted, he got a lot of his knowledge from Schwaladulubits, which which predates him by I think a hundred years. Did you be told already? I thought in about these. I believe there was a number of people, not a lot, but a number of people had talked about these types of objects. The precision we've seen this in the pyramids potentially moving back the age of the snakes and other objects for another megolithic building projects, several earlier than what's commonly accepted. And no one had really attempted the analysis to refute or accept any of these propositions. So that was one, I think that was one thing that I guess I'll take right for that actually having a scan done and looking at some preliminary results. Now I'm not a metrologist, so let's see a big round. So I have a math background. I have higher education in mathematics, it's a statistic, I understand math theory and then statistical mathematical theory to some extent. I don't know a PhD, but the master is great, it helps. But I think the way I think about these things is top down, like from an intuitive sense, like does this story make sense from what we're seeing? And if the answer is no, that's that's really intuitive nature for me stops and the actual analytics take over and then it's like, all right, well, these look special. They don't seem to be made by the people that they're ascribed to. Those people don't seem to have had the technology to do them. There's no evidence of that. They seem to be in possession of them, however. And so is there a way we can take a look at these objects to see if there's any information we can extract from. You may have just from the beginning that those people had no tools, which were, well, I don't think that's a fact. I think that's the mainstream view is that primitive tools were used. And when I say primitive handles, so stone handles and potentially early types of metal in some cases, right? So bronze age cultures had bronze. They had copper. Bronze was after Nagada much later. That we think. Right. So you be, you know, if if somebody's making bronze, and another culture comes in and displaces that culture, and it's never seen bronze before they would probably take every piece they could find or reuse them. So we don't really know, I don't think we know exactly when the bronze age started or how far back people have ever used metal. But we can, we can say when certain cultures are using it widely, and it was widespread. So, you know, I think, I think the point here is, I didn't really know exactly what I was doing but we started, I started seeing some results. The first scary did 89 years ago now showed some very basic metrology results. Like the circularity of a few components on that red, red, and it called like the OG phase. I scanned five or six objects and that one was the most precise bi-degree. A few of the other ones were, but not to the same degree. And that scanner was capable of accuracy up to the point, up to the limit of the scale and capabilities we were finding. So I was proximatetee in what? A few thousandth of an inch circularity, state or deviation, which was I think the boundary limit of what that scan, of what the scanning equipment was capable of. After I met Chris Dunn and his son Alex, his son Alex, his metrologist, and works in this field quite a bit. So we involved a few other people that work alongside Alex and we, we tried to, you know, not only develop the types of analytics that we were doing, types in terms of the metrics and the making big comparisons, but then also scan it as many other objects as we can. We eventually used some CT, scanning equipment, or X-ray technology, we've also used photogrammetry. So it's grown from there, which one was the best, and the most accurate. The CT scanning in terms of the methodology. The CT scanning is by far because it's capturing hundreds of times where data points. But there's some problems that have some drawbacks with that. Photogrammetry is developing quite rapidly. Probably it's probably developing faster than the other. Photogrammetry when you are taking pictures and you're stitching those pictures together and creating the three-dimensional object based on the pictures. That's why it's not that accurate. As laser, structured light, or CT. Right. Both are using light CTs using X-ray technologies, which is a different, you know, spectrum. But I think the point is that technology that has continued to grow and develop, and you know, thanks to Shining 3D and the combo scan. Free scan combo. Plus, I think it's now at a point where it's more versatile than it used to be while maintaining that level of accuracy. So we can bring a quickment to various sites rather than having a break. The sites to the equipment. So I think it's enabling us to expand this into other mediums, not just stone lasers. So that's stay choose, books, etc. Yeah, and movable objects. So yeah, so that's kind of how it started and now where it goes from here. You know, there's a lot more people involved and just to know like you and others. So hopefully we can continue to do this work and one day into their future, maybe publish some preliminary results. Bring on the engineers and yeah. Yeah. Cheers. Cheers. So what's the actual description of that way they made these faces in Egypt or even before? What's what's the the main source explanation for the making process? Well, from what? And I think that's evolved that continues to evolve from what I gather the mainstream explanation relates primarily to Alibaster. So Alibaster is widely known to have been performed in executed beautifully. In a lot of cases, by-diedastic Egyptians during the LDAP, old middle and late kingdoms. And so Alibaster, I think, truly speaking, you would be able to find a joke about Alibaster you would using various pounding stones, dollar-right-nother things, get a spherical object for you then use some sort of a boring instrument like a tubular drill, potentially copper, with an abrasive. Somehow you have to drill out these interior center. Yeah. Now, curiously, some of these actually the Alibaster ones are more commonly left with a tube drill and not hollowed out. Some of them are, but the hollowing out part typically is explained by this fork-stick-based drill. That's placed inside and then turned and it would scrape out the inside, quartz sand and some water and some other abrasive material. Something. I don't think it's necessarily known what they were using, but it's a desert. There's quartz everywhere. Courts is a rough way. It's a heart. It's a seven on the most scale where Alibaster's like a three. So that would easily cut. The Romans and others were using bronze with, I think, very little abrasive to cut calcite now Alibaster. So in limestone. Some of the stone can be cut with out precision tools whatsoever with very rudimentary hand tools. You see that in limestone, they're shaped, they're beautiful. There's many, there's probably millions of there everywhere. They're interesting and they're pretty, but they're not made to anything close to the level of sophistication that we see in some of the quote unquote, pre-dynastic phases. The stuff that's acknowledged to the older and it's in a harder medium. So we're talking about deer right and and granits are, there are all the harder of quartz. And some of these stones are most of the stones are all they're all hard or genius in composition and mineral composition. Meaning there's lots of stuff inside them. It's not one like these crystalline collusions and so do these stuff. Right? That's right. Great. It itself has as a composition of six to seven eight different types of minerals normally and then when you see these large, this could be felt sports, probably felt sports. Like they're the pinkish hue or quartz sometimes you see quartz. That's going to be a different hardness of different mineral composition and the ground mass material that you see in dark and darker shades. So that's going to require a positive material of this exactly. Do you know? They call it poor-free, which is a conglomerate of different materials. The hardness is in a very hard-ish component of poor-free would probably be the quartz which is around a seven. If you're looking for a numerical scale that's the most scale. But it's possible that there's other things in there. So how is what's sort of an abrasive? It's a remgenit in oddness. Yeah, it's comparable. It's similar. It's closer to greater than it is to all of us or anything. So it's probably about that same. But the way you would go about cutting it, it's not just a homogeneous piece of seven on the most, you need to figure out. We have harder and softer material inside, correct. And the mineral composition can vary in terms of size as well. Just amazing coat. I know you can pull it shrug easily, be it hand, but it's still just when you this is the first time when I can hold such thing and see with my bare eyes and it's just beautiful. Little. Even though you said maybe it's handmade. Or not entirely. This, this may not, this doesn't appear to have, we're doing somewhere now, so on this now. But this doesn't appear to be to the same calibers. A lot of the other pieces we scanned it out. Some of them are nearly perfect in every dimensional component of the piece like the OG. Yeah, OG range. That doesn't have any flat surfaces. Everything has a rainy eye and all the radios are, you know, are there's phenomena? That's what's candid that first go on? Or yes, we've scanned that several times, it's several different devices. We've done it with some with blue light structure light scanning. We've done it with CT scanning. We don't want to gravitate the process of scans as they increase in their level of accuracy. We've seen where accurate results, because now the scanner is capable of picking up. That's a great. So, you know, we see results where it's it's five, five, 10,000th of an inch. So, way less than 1000th of an inch in terms of deviation from perfect circle. That's less than 25 light runs. All right, it's like 10 micron deviation per per less. And so that level of work is today, the way that would be done today. We could talk about the, about the how, but it is done today. But it's reserved for specific application. And it's done in a modernist material or a most often a metal alloy. It can be like a tip by type of silica like a glass for like a so somebody recently told me the only time you've seen this level of work done is in the lens of like a side-winder missile, where it's a, you know, it's a type of silica glass. And it's large. It's this big. So, normally, that level of deviation or or tolerance of ua or accuracy is directly related to the size of the object. So, the smaller the object would normally correspond to the smaller tolerance that's required to be maintained. Larger objects, typical don't require that level of tolerance and they're rarely done even in the metal. So, it's very rare that you would see a large object. This is not, I don't not saying this is as accurate as the other one, whereas some of the other days is that we've looked at, but a larger object of this size would be very rare or uncommon to see such small tolerance as applied. It would not be necessary for any conceivable application. The lower tolerance is would be required by lower components by smaller components. So, that's an additional reason why it's rare. And the machines we have today are set up and the procedures are set up for clomogenous materials. Is this from the same guy, same diplomat? And through the OG days, now different, is it different from, yeah? Was it a gift probably or some kind of gift or you bought it, but it's, you know, exported legally, but where was it, we're going to come from, you know, it could have been a gift from, you could have been bribery, you know, it could have been, could have been any number of reasons. And there's so many of these things they were, they were hinted out to people. Is the point? Someone was visiting and they came home with tenonies. You said that maybe the lip is not the precise as the neck or the top. Yeah, it's hard to speculate. You know, when you stay back from across the room, it looks very nice and then you come up with a close-up. It's because we scanned it. Yeah, we will, I would defer until we see the scans. Many of these have been dropped and damaged and repolished. You also see divots that were purposefully smoothed out. Just as you see in some of the grant boxes, the box overall shape looks pretty nice when you come up close. You may see an imperfection that was then scooped out, they looked out and then repolished very carefully, potentially because they didn't work that imperfection to propagate and expand. We don't know. And so does that take away from the overall accuracy? Well, it's going to affect the scaling results. So we need to look at these things comprehensively before we make any conclusions. Definitely. The last thing I would say is about this topic is what we can talk about this more. But in 2015, there was an electron microscopy, a microscope, a project done by the metropole, a metropole, a microscope, a microscope, a microscope. Yes, a microscope. A microscope. It's a hundred. It's hard at any language. The metropole didn't use the in-mobart in New York, did a study on this about 2015, I think. And so they had a limestone block with a cordial in it, which isn't as common. You see that all around Egypt, but limestone sometimes will have less common to see that. Anyway, there seem to be residual material in the bottom. So, potentially, potentially it was left over from the last piece of equipment to have done that. Until they said, oh, this is interesting. We see all this residue, let's analyze it. And so under an electron microscope, you can potentially look at the mineral composition. And so they found they found the number of interesting things there. They did find bronze and copper residue. So that's what's surprising. That reinforces the main tree of the, they also found quartz and corundum. Some more recently, corundum is aluminum, the deoxyne, if I'm not mistaken. A little bit of oxide is the composition, and it occurs naturally as corundum. So corundum and then there's different types of gemstones that are a form of corundum as well. So gemstone mining, if you're looking for specific gemstones, you may find different types of corundum that you can repurpose, and there are gemstone mines in Egypt. So this stuff was there. There's an active corundum mine in Egypt still to this day. So it's not unknown where it came from. But corundum is very hard. It's like a mine on the hardness scale. So it's just under a diamond. And that would have been more than enough to cut most of the materials that we see in pyramids and bases and everything else. If you're just trying to embrace, it'll be cut it. So corundum was found. And I think that reinforces the view that you could use a soft material like copper bronze and a very artobracive, slurry or solution that could have quartz and corundum in it and cuts through the lens still very easily. You could cut through granite with that fairly easily. So I think that's the main stream perspective is that that's how these things were cut. And indeed that would cut all of these materials, but cutting and finishing are two different things. And when we see not only the cutting but in the polishing that results in a thousand of an inch, 25 microns, 0.025 millimeter in instead of deviation from perfect circle in terms of circularity, that cannot be done by rudimentary handles. It can't. It's not possible. It's not possible to get there. You have to make that do a bit something which is the same like you're at, at least, but you have to go feel several magnitudes lower or higher in inaccuracy basically. Typically the tool that's making something needs to be capable of making something more accurate than what you're trying to make. That's to that standard. You typically cannot take a tool that's capable of a point one inches and make something that's a tenth of an inch and make something that's a thousandth of an inch end up. Tollards. You know what's the tumbler for this in menstrual logic? The rule? Yeah, for how accurate the device has to be to reach that level. So in the trial times? Well, if we're talking about the tools or the metrology in, I think it's generally ten times so it's about an order of magnitude, right? One decimal point. If we're talking about metrology, so how do you know if what you're doing is that accurate? So tenth of an inch we can probably see with our eye. And you can measure that with variety tools. Thousands of an inch you can't. So that level of accuracy is not visible to the human eye. Fraction. Human hair. You find it. Right. Actually, human hair. Right. Fraction. Human hair. You can't see that with the naked eye. And that's maintained across the entire historical body of an object. And a lot of these objects are polished. When you're polishing an object, you're going to do something. You're going to remove material. So you have to measure how much should I remove from this way or from this direction to reach that precision. And do I have to, I should more here, more here, more here, more here. So so these things are very difficult to do. They're very difficult to do by today's standards in homogenous mediums that are softer to cut. This is a heterogeneous medium. It's a lot harder to work in. And we don't have, we don't have, we don't even have the metrology. The metrology we have is designed for heterogeneous materials like glass, different metal alloys. Not, we don't have stone based metrology because we don't make things in stone. We don't have tools for it. We can, we can probably repurpose our tools, but there's a lot of other reasons why it would be quite difficult. Very expensive. You wouldn't ask somebody for a quote. You would expect that you're going to pay however much it costs because nobody really knows how much it's going to cost, going to do it. Two thousand slaves. Yes. Have you seen this experiment on the scientists against myth channel when they made with traditional methods they made a granite vase and they converted it with museum pieces. Not precisely, it was not scanned precisely or not measured precisely, but I don't know that was a debunker video, but it's just a little bit funny. They basically, in my opinion, they basically proved that they cannot make these precise ways. This is with the traditional method. That's funny. Yeah. So we can use them to illustrate or play. I commend them for the diligence and dedication to doing that. It was impressive. I was not, I'm not going to sit down for whatever it took them a year or two. I think two years. So that's the mainstream explanation as these were taking several years. It took them that long using rudimentary techniques, but they didn't replicate these ways. They made something that's rudimentary. You can see in the video it's not, it's not the same. And when they measured it, they didn't measure correctly. Like a metrology wasn't performed correctly. They weren't looking at deviations. They were, they were, they were doing absolute measurements in comparison. Like meter, both thickness and these. And this is not there in anything. Yeah. Well, it tells that you made something similar in size, in similar form. But yeah, the accuracy wasn't there. But these was on the centimeter or maybe subsentimeter level, but not migrants, not even close to migrants. They're measurements, they're not even close to. Yeah. And so they threw their hands up and said, we can't, you know, it's not worth it or we don't want to. That doesn't prove that it, that they couldn't then apply a different method. It's a polishing it down to the accuracy we want. I mean, if they, if they roughed out a basic shape, then you could go back and finish it maybe with a different method. Sure. I think that there are no hand, there are no, you know, primitive hand-based methods that can result in it. Whatever we're talking about, we're talking about the use of a machine tool, for sure. Now, what are the dynamics created with having in the way of machines almost nothing? Now, more often, I think more recently, there's archaeologists and he's a topologist that may acknowledge they had to lay it and they had primitive access-based machines potentially. And so that could help us get a little bit closer. It's still not enough. You know, we, we learned how to do this decades ago, just decades ago. In the 1800s, we did not have the capability of making it. But from everything I've seen and gathered, it was probably 1940s, 1950s, where we first started being able to achieve these levels of tolerances in metal. Okay, not even granted. From what I've seen, it's never been done in granted using modern technology. We haven't seen any examples of that. So again, we're not seeing a care. We just haven't seen it. And these are definitely turns when we go down in the in the step-to-row meeting Sakara. We have seen those pieces and you don't so told me that you have some bases in there. You have turning marks in the inside. We can see lines that rotate with the audio of the vessel. Extrations that go around and around. We are examining a piece, a shard, an, uh, it's as March, I guess, when we were in Egypt with Chris King and he realized or he noticed that there are turning marks on this. It was a broken part from the from the lower section of a ways. It was also granite or some similar hard stone and you could clearly see the turning line or the turning marks, the tool marks. So these were somehow turned. Or the machine was revolving. I don't know if we can prove which one. There's always been a debate or was the tool spinning or was the object spinning? Well, the, the object spinning. We'll be returning. Chris King has had the feeling that it, the object was turning and not the, not the on that piece on that piece. But we can talk with him in a few days. Right. So it, I mean, you know, okay. In other words, it's pretty hard to use a tool capable of a tenth of an inch to go to anything higher than that. It's almost impossible. It's a chicken and egg problem. Like, how do we get through the next level of accuracy? We need to have those tools. We need to have the engineering and the know-how to then translate that into making tools repetitively that are capable producing this sort of accuracy. It's a chicken and egg problem, right? We don't know what came first. You don't really know how you get there. Now the process of doing that, I'm going to read a quote in a few minutes that explains that a little bit how we did it in the 1930s and 40s. But the, this sum of the conclusion is that it's a, it's a scientific advancement question that takes place over hundreds of years. That's how it did for us. And it's built up over a long period of time. So, you know, one thing to note, I just, you just mentioned this with the scientists against that example. But when we talk about accuracy or tolerance, we're talking about state or deviation, normally in modern, in machining today, when something is specified, it's usually describing the max deviation. That's allowed. So, we're going to make this cylindrical shape and the max tolerance might be 100th of an inch or, you know, 0.2 millimeters. And that's maximum because this, this implement, all the tools that we generally make today that are designed to tolerance is like, our functional. If something's functioning, spinning on an axis, we don't want part of it to be rotating and maybe hitting something or interfering with another component or the meaning of that it's spinning inside of, right? So, that's why tolerance is important because of the function. Why would, why would a vase or a vessel need that sort of tolerance? Doesn't that doesn't also make sense. Of course, the traditional explanation is that the holding something mundane, like, flowers or water or body oil, clearly pottery does that just as well. It's a lot easier to make. And so, these are just holding something, why would you need any level of accuracy whatsoever? You can see that a certain stone vessel may be very nice looking. It doesn't have to be that accurate. It doesn't have to be accurate down to the thousands or a 10,000 of an inch. Today, they make glass containers. Have they ever found glass containers in pre-dynastic graves or silvers? There's Libyan desert glass, which is allegedly created when lightning gets the desert and some of those glass pieces have been repurposed into objects. I don't think they made glass from desert courts. You need an extremely high temperatures and typically electricity is used for that. So, I don't think they were making glass. They were cutting hard stone. Sure. They cut, there's a desks cut, or anything, sometimes. Very rarely. When you did, you could see it. You can see it with your naked eyes and it's just a little different from the high-president stone vessels. Because my body oil is perfectly happy in the last containers. That's what I asked. Yeah, it depends. How much body oil was one person in the, do you need a jug of it in your room in your house at all? So, you pour it in on your head? What's that? No idea. What's going on with all the body oil? I don't, they do. They do it in a party. These Egyptians. These essential oils are really nice, actually, from Egypt. But they are all in glass containers, which you can buy today. Yeah. You go back to your point. You need tools and metrology. You need tools that are capable of generally access accuracy and precision when you're making something. Because of a few things, you have fluctuation and temperature. You have residue. You have dust particles and chemicals and things like that that can get in the way. Like a little tiny piece of sand can get onto something and change things. You have wear and tear and damage from repeated use of the tools. Take a look at what cutting glass does to a tool, or trying to make crystal object. The super precise. You're putting a lot of wear and tear on a tool that's using an abrasive like a forceful mechanism to remove matter. Then you have like the abrasion the corrosion and just the general degradation to consider. That's before you're considering the vibrational load that you're putting on a tool. The manufacturing process itself is going to create a lot of heat and friction. If you're designing a tool, you need to account for that. What secondary side effects are going to be created when I'm starting to hit the spinning renovations or my tools spinning and hitting a stationary rabbit base. We need to take those into consideration when we're designing our tools. We're talking about sophistication, like really sophistication that's just light years above what the diagnostic Egyptians certainly have been credited with. Now, the mainstream criticism was that people could master simple tools if you gave someone a hammer or a chisel or 30 years they would learn how to make you know a Michael Angela David's sculpture out of marble. I think that's that's possibly true when you're talking about artistic expression and artistic skill. We're talking about precision in quality and in not-in results. No simple tool is going to be capable of that. No matter how skilled the artist is, the tool is not capable of it. Those objects are not granite, they are marble and which is much softer and well I'm just lying stone. Yeah exactly. Even if you're skill second can improve artistically it's not going to necessarily apply to all like you said all mediums and it's also a convenient argument because it means that we're never going to be able to improve or just prove it because we don't have 30 years to spend trying. I think that's kind of an easy way out and it's not a logical either. So you know the knowledge engineering it took to figure out how to build these types of tools it took us hundreds of years to build. To build tools capable of reliably doing this or an organ it means that engineers and metrologists but engineers needs to repeatedly measure things far beyond the limits of human perception. In an actual manufacturing environment not just the finished product but the environment where all this heat and friction is being generated as well which deforms the tools and creates other side effects repeatedly. So when you're machining you have this intense build up a heat in both the object and the instrument. Right so you know this heat can cause additional error sometimes a lot. I think this all speaks to the argument that the highest accuracy it may have ensued with some process that wasn't forcible that wasn't like in a breeze. We're not crushing and bashing and knocking pieces of the stone away. We're not flaking it off like making a Flint spearhead or arrowhead. That's how they try to rough it out in the Sianti Stigensmith video. Yeah I saw that. I saw a copper chisel knocking away visible visible pieces of it'll mineral content in the stone and the accuracy is far smaller than the visible pieces. And they've tried to measure the circularity with a hand held pencil. Then it's drawing a line or not on the circular object. It's like yes it's nice to the eyes but it's not. I had the feeling that they don't even understand what we are talking about here. The metrics. That was my feeling that this is nice. This is a very great effort but not are we talking about. It's nice to see people roll up their sleeves and do something instead of just criticize other people online. So I think you have to respect that and give them what I do. Yeah yeah so do I. You know I think that whatever listen if we're having trouble figuring out a way to do today. I think the answer is they were they had it they had an unknown process with respect to some of the things they were doing at least that was either more advanced than we have today or we're just something we're just not thinking of. There could be an easy answer that we're not thinking of but the best minds have the best minds of manufacturing have been struggling with this concept for progressive years. So I think the answer is just something we're we're something we're missing all together. You know I've heard it always sounded to me like there was some you know there was always there was always some explanation like maybe revolving around ultrasonic tools like you were you were tuning your your tool the vibrate with the frequency of the meeting you were cutting maybe something like that would help you separate on an atomic level like this Sonic to his brush with the Sonic to his brush which is removing the the plex with a high level of vibration and this vibration is causing cavity bubbles in the saliva or the liquid in your mouth and that's flaking off the the plex. Maybe know how that's where yeah that's that's great um that sounded to me like just a enough a less abrasive method you know work we're thinking about things in a higher level we're separating the material we're getting the material to separate itself we're not smashing it out of existence and I've heard you know I've heard brush Alan and Ben then Kirkwick talk about potentially other explanations like there was a cutting fluid that was actually a bit of a piece of metal even a rudimentary piece of metal like iron or copper that was introducing some sort of a frequency or per you know electronics sort of medium if electronic signal if you will to the nit you'll excite a cutting fluid to actually perform to this work there's a lot of explanations that are not related to the standard abrasive cutting techniques that we use today whether it's cutting or grinding or polishing what we're effectively doing is we're using something hard to remove material and I think the answer might be a little different here we also see courts and felt spark crystals that are cut cleanly in accordance with the circular geometry of the ground mass and the rest of the piece without knocking those crystals out right now granted this could be one out of a hundred and the other 99 didn't work out so well so they threw them away yeah that's fine I only answered the timeline it makes them more expensive but it also means like why would you do that if your success rates so low why would you spend so much time to hold body oil it that doesn't make any sense to me I'm not a machine is but I used metal late a lot when I was younger and I cannot imagine what happens when the tool heats hard to crystal in the material so you probably set your tools set and everything in the speed which is the best for the homogeneous material but when there is a harder piece inside that's what do you do I don't know I'm not the machine is but it's definitely challenging problem in my opinion definitely we're in safety equipment and I'm out of a machine is either so I listen into other people and I get there perspectives and then sometimes I repeat it if it makes sense and try to credit people if I think it's interesting thought or something I didn't know but you know this is a project that requires I think other people to help with it one person's not going to answer these questions on the well so here's a quote from him an experience engineer let's call him Robert for help and he he wrote a few things that I think are pretty interesting so you were in context with him or yes so he was responding to this concept he was addressing this concept of we can do this with primitive tools if we have enough time and it's done and also it's routinely done today which is not true this is not done today and it's this level of accuracy done sometimes today rarely today in metal and other materials and so his comment he was looking at some of the highest accuracy results in terms of lowest standard deviation from like in circularity for instance we see in some of the grid it phases and you know his his response was there's one one spherical ceramic which is high mo's it's it's a hard substance high mo's hardness item that I can think of that hits these numbers that comes close to this level of accuracy the lens on a modern side one or missile but that's a simple simple hemisphere not a multi-curve service in an in-amogenous material like granite so combabab goes on bronzage civilizations simply can't do this stuff if they can and they are not bronzage so this is evidence that the Egyptians are not bronzage in contradictions of the protestations of the army of angry Egyptologists and the double archaeologists or they were not produced by dinosaur Egyptians and are impractical to produce using modern industrial technology because you cannot find these after the pre-dynistic era that's right they had not produced anymore maybe attribute it to but not probably not produced that time there were produced because there's no evidence that there were and archaeologists don't say that way so they were sometimes the first couple of dynasty that's it and that's probably because those people just own them and put their names on and be handling something and you've seen what happens when someone tries to write their aiming grant statues and and seropium boxes looks like shit so continuing with the quote um this is high technology we couldn't make the machine used by inheritance machining in the 1940s so 1940s we couldn't do it let alone the machines that made these machines and here's why you start up with a reference maybe somewhere in a government lab back in the 1940s that would probably be set using a ground gradient reference plate in combination with an interference fringe from a specific arc lamp or gas discharge tube all floating on a pool of mercury at a specific ambient temperature in pressure controlled within a few hundreds of a degree I think he needs fairer plate you can then transfer that by measuring the exact response of imperfect high thread in lead screws and measure the via linear deflection of a dial spring apparatus in order to cross calibrate screw spring reference pairs then then collects statistics and measured the preceding of your references i.e. radians per fringe per inch of deflection by a mass references set using cavendish balances um lost so I can't explain this you can then calibrate this against derrious analog electronic devices and work your way out from there by counting fringes as you adjust voltage swaps springs in turn screws this can be referenced to objective physical standards like the work function of specific metals or the voltage of specific electrical chemical reactions using the deflection of cathode rays on a phosphorescent screen by electrodes charged to a potential set by these specific voltage standards so he's describing how you can go from concept to actual making a machine to them being able to make a machine that can replicate this and make other machines right how do we step up our our accuracy over time to the decades so you know I don't I'm not sure I'm not a I'm a little bit lost in the specifics he's talking about but I understand that just a bit it's quite specific it's quite specific and I think this is one of the most people's heads generally but he goes on to say you can read about how we access to the first access precision using crude apparatuses and techniques that could then be transferred into high precision references suitable for use in machine shops like ground gauge blocks but without that calibrated sub micron repeatable physical standard you're not going to transfer 10 to 100 micron precision until multi-axis curved surfaces like these that span 10 or more centimeters so the bigger you get the harder it is it all out of cases it's just an artifact of how errors propagate in accumulating real physical media go join and this is he's at in commentary go join a maker community and learn how to use a latin try making some tools like dial calipers try to make dial calipers and dial indicators was scratched then see how things you make using modern machines and your home brew indicators compared to identical parts made the same way but with the professional made mechanical tools keeping in mind that before the 1920s no one in a random machine shop had access to any of this kind of stuff so this really started in the 1940s are our capabilities you know so the process of moving to more and more precise machines and tools because it's self-assigned that's a that's a very high-level science how do we build tools that can do this so this raising another question regarding the modern forgery or fake ways is like if you have the provenance which leads you back maxo 18 centuries or 19 centuries that you can trace it back until then it who owned it and when they tea got it transported it from Egypt blah blah blah what was the price then probably approximately of one of these phases and 1900s few hundred bucks probably a few dollars making this machinery and this precision tools to make these with costs back then GDP percentages in a country no more questions thank you so that's that's as you know like you know part of part of our project is working with objects that have not left Egypt yes now there's always there might really be the question like did someone shut down the museum and replace all the objects and forgery's whenever it goes whenever it totally absolve ourselves from um people who think that everything is a modern reproduction but i think we're beginning to understand that making these things in modern times is not easy it's very very difficult we've never seen it done i have not seen it done and no one has been able to demonstrate that it is possible i believe it's possible but we're not set up for it so think about the cost and the expense of setting up for it there's a question mark in terms of the how much it will cost why would you do that but uh we do it to sell it and make a shit ton of money you wouldn't do it to lose money hey if you were doing it because you were interested in proving people like us wrong where are you come for hard speakermind you know we can handle it but the attitudes made me furious when i first saw bands video uh from a short-term i saw the scan-based project videos and the comments and how the modern or the mainstream accepted it or received it was like yeah these are fake and forgery and the provenance is not right and that point i decided okay i will make a list of european museums with uh significant Egyptian artifacts and they wrote to all of them to let me in i will bring the the scan-requipment i will bring everything let me analyze those basis those vessels balls any other hard stone precise object and i wanted to analyze these bases which technically came out of these graves documentedly and truly and uh this is hopefully happening next week well thanks yeah thanks to to that outreach that you did um with putry um and et actually it was kind of easy well it hasn't been easy for other people so it's part of it is your approach i think has been you demonstrate that you know on climb you just had to explore in these things when academic perspective we're doing it according to like correct scientific principles. Actually that's that's how we connected in in Egypt because uh i told you this project project of mine and uh yeah okay your idea was to let's work together because much more effective and this is much more um it's wiser to work together in the sembler forces. Yeah yep yeah so um so a little bit maybe we can talk about tolerances and measurements so metrology science and measurement right so can you present a few things of the previous scans for example the OGVs or some really really remarkable bases is it possible yeah yeah we can you know as we're talking about this we'll release we'll show everyone some um some results of some of the scans that we've done and we'll get we'll give a sense of like what are we actually talking about when we say because accuracy what does that mean where are we measuring what parts of the bases are we measuring and why is this important that's how we determine that the most of the people don't understand okay these are very very tiny little numbers but why is it important why is it remarkable because all these debunker channels seemingly don't understand I have had a problem doing that um as you know we we have tried to be on the radar and quiet about this for a number of years because our interests isn't working with the academic community and we didn't want speculation out there before we were able to conduct the real analysis secondly I'm not a graphic designer and so when we're showing a metrology report it's sometimes difficult to know what you're looking at so part of it there's different reasons for it but you know we were talking about metrology it's the science of measurement and there are universal standards so there's something called geometric dimensioning and tolerance and or G D and T if you look it up so this is like a system used by most countries worldwide it's it's an engineering um name it's a system used in engineering to define the what's what's allowable when you're making something like how how much can this vary or tolerance how taller are of you are variances in the form in the shape and orientation um you know where it's sitting the location of features in an object um you know and then then the surface deviation so there's various parts to this but one of the most important that's widely used that that we have that we use all the time is circularity so that's um how round do you want something to be how taller are you of something not being route doesn't need to be so you know this is how we sure that circular parts meet the desired requirements if we're talking about the drive shaft of a car something that's made to be spinning you can want that to be pretty close to a circle otherwise the edges might they could throw off you know the center of mass potentially or hit something something is really very very interesting yeah exactly induced vibration um you know it's if you ever been in a car that's been rebuilt and things are done properly you might find vibration different RPMs that could be because something's off uh center of that and you know the access of rotation might not be perfect so it defines it defines how closely features a round of the perfect circle um and so the surface deviation like how much that deviates from it versus its ideal form which is as we know we can draw perfect circle using any computer and then test the difference between each point we take the standard deviation because we want an absolute number we don't want pluses and negatives right so we swear or take the square root you're adding them all up take the average square root take the square root um so you think about like shafts or even holes any any cylindrical objects or component of another object um may require maintaining this consistent diameter right so this is critical for for proper function or proper assembly um who knows but it's it's a common thing um now we hardly ever make spherical objects we make things that have cylinders but very rarely spherical it doesn't matter we can still use circles to to look at things to look at um circularity but think like lenses on a missile for instance which is where the reference came you know we're looking at very um you know these upper echelon v's which which have circularity all over the place they may have hundreds of radii embedded in the design that relates to one another thought of two not a cylinder there's spherical geometry all over the place so the complexity here is is dialed up you know off the scale so um where do you normally we're concerned about again maximum allowable tolerance like how much can we allow the the deviation to be before it's like a critical error or we have to start over again um so that it will it'll work smoothly or not interfere or interact with something up so we may be concerned with like the standard deviation like average deviation sure um but normally you'll just hear people talk about the absolute tolerance like what can we tolerate in terms of the absolute difference from for what we're going for um and it's typically down to the hundreds of an inch so normally in most manufacturing like on average when metrology is applied we're concerned about hundreds of an inch or about 0.2 millimeters um in certain cases and beyond that though so sure we do manufacture things well in excess of that um in reaching the industry um it's it's typically aerospace it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's industries where because you're using the trawology for objects that are you could obviously you can see them we're not talking about nano technology that's a very specific application or micro processor does that it's completely different so it's a completely different thing we're not using structured light to measure deviations so when we're using structured light metrology we're talking about mechanical components normally which you can see you can steal you can pick up the bigger they are typically the less precise they need to be or the more tolerance you can you can allow the smaller they are it's usually correlated with increased levels of tolerance so there's standards to define today um by ISO and a national organization for state or decision that a lot of countries will hear too so one of them like this one called ISO 276A that relates to like linear and angular dimensions and so their size based tolerance is like given a size of an object what what are general like requirements and some of the moral origins and others but it's this it's this rage it's like a hundredth of an inch okay so points are a one or about point two five millimeters is like a very common tolerance once you get up on that you're in a different special mirror in different range you're talking about specific applications their higher-room processes it's not commonly done can be but it's not the most majority of things are not that like that um so you know we're talking about circularity we're also talking about constant tricity coaxiality this was you're measuring yeah it's basically we're doing that as well so it did two circles share common features they share common center access point common center or does the whole body share the same access and if they don't it could be indications that there's run out that tool the tool being used in a machine that was doing the work was stopping and starting if it took an Egyptian it took somebody two years to make something they're not working twenty four hours a day for two years they're stopping and starting the machine and you'd see run out and so those measurements can help and when you come back we did tool it those introduces an an error on the wall thickness or something right right so um you know the numbers that we see in metrology or commonly referring to minimum maximum they're not typically referring to state or deviation so yeah we're talking about something similar it's a little bit different but it's it's a similar concept so just in case there's something lost there um you know we use the state of deviation to describe the accuracy because we may see phases that are heavily damaged there's wear and tear they've been banged up on the millennium and you do have granite which has sometimes like sharp pieces in it and so you're gonna see absolute tolerance is that that could vary that could be outside the standard deviation uh where metal it doesn't look like that metal homogenous and same as glass there's not like giant pieces inside there's not big clusters of mineral content that's like sticking up everywhere so we're talking we we we we talk in terms of statistics so standard deviation um and again there are there are no universal standards for how do you measure that stone could they might be a little bit different than how we measure in metal so this is not an easy topic it's not an easy question and it all goes into this idea that we don't do this today right it's not done today um doesn't mean it's not possible but it means it's not done so when we say you know when we say stone base has circularary tolerance or accuracy of a thousand of an inch it doesn't mean that there are no points that are more than a thousand of an inch it means that the average is is that much deviation um but it's also the same it means the same in the industry. Right right so it depends and it also depends on the application too so you know we're talking about heterogeneous stone again with damaging we're in terror. Sustainability deviation is not always used sometimes maximum or absolute is also yeah yes so sometimes so you know we may get a standard deviation but a lot of times there you know you give the machine instructions usually the tolerances conveyed in terms of maximum due to maximum allowable deviation. Do we know in the mexel deviation on the scans? Yeah we have that too so it's you know the maximum minimums are going to be they should be equal to equal distance for me so um you know again I think chipping and breaking pieces of stone off is not the logical explanation in terms of how these are done. What about chipping and then pollution? Well that's yeah that's that's possible but the polishing would have to be a super advanced polishing process because the polishing is what ultimately results in this level of accuracy so you're polishing something you're still removing material and if you're a rotary material in a certain part you're to make sure that's applied equally and then you're still using advanced patrology or measure where they're not your end result is in your tolerance bounce. Yeah to devil in the details why how would you measure how much you should polish on that side to reach the other side's level? Yeah it's like it cannot be explained by they had enough time and slaves and money and everything and just so before sorry before World War II we used metal inspection plates after World War II and then really I think in the 1960s but generally in the early 1960s we started using rannit we so we just started using stone as a suitable medium for inspection plate because it's more impervious to changes in pressure in temperature than metal. So as we evolve we're using war stones toning again. Then the high level precision is needed yeah. Right so allegedly now if I to bring this back and put in context allegedly that even the die-nastic Egyptians use this like black granite stick as a way of ensuring consistency and measurement so they had this I don't know that they were called granite measuring sticks and you can you can yes you could find them in certain museums and I've heard about them and allegedly the idea every year you'd bring it in to whoever was controlling the standards of leisure in Egypt and they would be measured against this like master version to make sure it was calibrated. Ah this is a... oh is it called the Egyptian cubic the disblack rickting not rectangular but like octagonal so yeah I think sometimes it wrote something like that yeah like some sort of a rod yeah is this black isn't it basult? I think it was granite could be black granite yeah true. The salt almost is hard though but some are still yeah so they did have they did have standards and they had basic forms of metrology but we're not talking with we're talking about orders of magnitude to different that we literally just in our modern society just learned but that rod was not used for these precise measurements. I probably the material was chosen for this rod to be robust and they don't have to make a new one after a few years so it will be lost it will last long hard to can hard to tamper with them right because we can't cut because the Egyptians couldn't cut granite. They build a lot of things right they the Egyptians are I think the dinastic Egyptians are much more impressive than they're given credit for and they built some beautiful temples they had incredible knowledge of engineering and an astronomy and medicine so a lot of things they built are still there or they're not there because they were pulled down by other people are re-purpose or re-reaches like and find something yet certainly possible maybe there was underground the assembly lines or tools in this Sahara so big so undiscovered yeah to the west to the west of the Nile right yeah well think about that in means that region was last usavanna like seven thousand here like seven thousand BC right so almost before these in the cauticle these these nile cultures they all started living on the Nile that's the first really incidents of these phases maybe before then people were just living other places I don't know so there could be many more times what we found under the sand of the west we really own it's it's very poor it's rarely or infrequently explored do we want to not again is I think we might need one right and it seems like it was routed to of ten so what do we have here all right so this is a cross-sexual piece of one of the granite bases this is just like a simple metrology report describing what it is we're looking at so when we're talking about circularity here's ten different components were measuring it ten different places five in the interior five in the exterior just so we can see it some of these interior is their polished so we're not some actors are polished so we're not but the polishing doesn't seem to always be directly correlated to the precision we sometimes see unpolished surfaces that are still as accurate or as accurate not precision accuracy as others so this is the so-called OG base which stands for original or what what is OG original gangster because this was the first one analyzed and it wasn't the first one it's just the one that the most precise this is the one that Ben showcase in one of the earlier parkests okay now there's other ones that are this precise or more and again map out has a number of more precise of this and how was this data captured this is structured like data so this is captured using a structured like skating device using lasers optical light and then it's fed into a point-clad data set keep it pulled up in the number of software so yes okay you look inside the base or how did you capture the inside well this doesn't have a sharp lip here see this we can capture this because it does it because almost every interior surface is visible from the axle now it's side there's no overhang here okay so this goes straight down and there's no there's no overhang concealing the light preventing it preventing the light from getting in this is almost thicker this as you know a tubular drill and then they widened some of the body but not so much where the angle was too steep we couldn't scan completed this one inside because this shoulder was blocking the light at some point right but then it was possibly this one right there's a lot of shapes here there's a confederate in our shapes you did not modify the data you didn't change so it's the row point cloud was in a light right so it was not optimized or changed or you know I don't you know I don't know anyway but now um because in some software in some Swedish and in some software you could optimize it like feeling the holes the parts which was not properly scanned but oh if that's the case we wouldn't use the scan we would have to start again we want to make sure the scan is 100% or if there are holes we still use it so you're going to find places where data was missing we would just not measure the area yeah okay yeah we would ignore that area if part of the bottom wasn't completely scanned so in this one we left the the vase on the plain inspection table upright we didn't scan the bottom because the bottom's a lot of these are worn out so some of them were originally you know outwardly convex or what if that's the word and some of them would spin on their bottom they were perfectly balanced but a lot of the ones and most of them that are looks like they were heavily worn down probably because they were used and if you're using this you're constantly putting it on its base or a time it's going to wear into it so and very allies sometimes for example I see when these cases are so well you would have to turn it on or upside down and scan it again and align the two scans and these we'll also introduce some errors and it's better to avoid it yeah so I just don't think it's as interesting to look at the bottoms because the original bottom is not there in those cases that it's worn very heavily from use there's there's wear and tear and almost all of these right so this one there's a chip out of the top lip completely missing but other ones you'll see somebody at some point tried to fill it in with some sort of glue or resin or something like that I think it's sometimes see that but generally speaking there's there's wear and tear here which alter is the results so we're not alter in the result results for the wear and tear if you look at the analyzer's vessels and you fill in the data or it's missing you're going to get better results so we looked at the interior and the exterior so I think it's it's roughly the same you know we see a number of these points here so you have sections of this way yeah so so we looked at to there's 10 different data points five and the exterior and five and the interior just in this report we sometimes look at 100 light correct correct the same distance from the surface from each other from the bottom plane right so the interior the exterior both you know one inch to a strange whatever it is up and down the vessel in terms of microns we see state deviations of you know 15 and 20 17 16 12 real water cases and what does it mean that's the state or deviation so the average difference is spending to those who don't really understand these measurements or they stop right so if we draw us perfect circle over the data so we have plates plotted along us around it around a circle we overlay that with a circle and say if they were trying to achieve a perfect circle how close did they get to a perfect circle circularity and so we look at a difference between each one you know we add us up divide by the number of data points and we multiply then we square that and then we take the square root of it the reason we square take the square root is to get better than the negatives yeah right so now we have distance we don't care if it's inside or outside it's just the distance away from what we're trying to get now so that's the difficult state or deviation right that's the most one of most basic things you can calculate it didn't only measure one at one point you measure the entire circle it's the entire circle in a plane yeah it is in cut and parallel with the ground right so yeah so these are different planes we sliced we sliced and we created an artificial plane looked at all the points along that particular plane calculated the state or deviation of each point from that perfect circle that that computer draw it generates and says if they were going for a perfect circle how close did they get how good is this relative and here we can see the entire next area we'll just see right about the scene now every point is a little bit different this is 12 like runs this is 16 like runs these points are probably an inch apart but two centimeters apart from each other yeah so 16 like is 0.016 millimeters it's fine in sane that's right and this is using structure light skating where the limits of this scan are about here so the scan is not going to be able to pick up any things more accurate than this when we've used CT scanning devices we've seen accuracy another word are magnitude lower than this with the CT data because it's just it's extra it's x-ray technology excuse me there's millions of more data points and so you just have a lot more data it's more precise and accurate the resolution is a lot higher right the problem is some of the data files are 100 gigabytes big so it's it's a lot harder to work with and as we've mentioned before sometimes the x-rays are picking up interior data points of those days and so if we see a scans coming in with there's a lot of interior data points captured we basically have to throw that scan out because we don't want to be removing data points interior means inside the wall right yes so the wall could be a reference stack could be thin but it's picking up points inside there we don't want to use that because that's not the interior of the exterior picking up points means that some crystals in the wall can deflect the electrons or not the electrons but the x-rays uh uh definitely therefore it can cause some noise very close to the wall yeah I think you can also calibrate the machine if you're only going for the exterior I think you can I think there's a way to calibrate it so that it bounces off the stairs it's anything and then we'll get a very ap packer get representation of just the exterior but if we want the interior we have to allow the x-rays to pass through the exterior and then register the interior that's interior so that's that's the problem it's it's um and I don't know what makes an x-ray pick up a data planer not but remember it's a heterogeneous composite still with lots of different types of minerals maybe there's like pieces of metal maybe there's pieces of iron or something in there that that's bouncing like there could be any explanation here created group like all grants are different they come from all over the place um so was this 200 micrum so this is seven yeah right so this is the x-dereer and look at the interior see seven it's also a little bit funky here it's the it's the worst the most inaccurate measurement I would have to luck on those come from the log handle so the log handle is the student's jutting out right now a few things about this it's that it was a total real shape that wrapped around the vase typically and then some of it was removed to leave these things that jut out the curved almost like arms um I believe the holes were added later and then they may have been used to hunt to hang the vase or strap on a leather top you know what I was thinking about lately um what if it was basically glued on the vase the log handle uh they're part of the dirt and it's part of the same pieces of stuff um have you seen this idea of not stone softening but when it's decomposing the granite basically and making I had an interview I think this is the previous episode uh I had an interview with a guy called the Marta 40 who is experimenting with this so if you use a natural heated up it can eat out the the silicone content from the granite and it will leave some grains and water glass and if you mix this water glass with some wood ash which will basically the metal content in the wood ash will activate it basically to geopolymer or you can glue it again yeah I've heard wouldn't be possible just to chemically decompose the part of the vase and the lock handles and then put it back together and then polish it so you won't see the fitting I think yes um we've also seen vases that are incomplete that appear that you can see where they were moving the area in between the log handles really so I do believe that the log handles are part of the vessel that were then removed but what you're saying we would say could make sense but but the holes are are drilled much later the drill holes are drilled later yeah and a lot of a lot of vessels with log handles don't even have drill holes in them so they were definitely out of later like almost certainly it's super it's an inferior level of craftsmanship they're they came at it from both sides using some sort of drill and the drill left a line yeah they're not out of alignment it doesn't make it doesn't correspond with the craftsmanship or the rest of the vessel but in a way if these were used I'm not saying they were originally supposed to be handles it could have had another function or purpose but a lot of these were used as jars by other people that were ready to repurpose them right and so if they were used they were hung on something strung up handle a lot that would result in a fiat accuracy that we're reading here why is it much worse they were capable of perfection right below it and right above it why would this be worse I think probably a lot of it's because of the usage for the layer and tear or some other reason like it wasn't necessary because these were superfluous and some in some way or some reason they didn't have anything to do with the reason we were making the rest of it and so it just didn't matter as much that doesn't explain the holes and the holes again are not present on every vessel so I think almost definitely added later did you check more sections yeah well we did this report just pulls out ten just randomly but typically there's many I mean you could take an infinite number of not an infinite number of sections but then yeah we could check I'd say hundreds or thousands but it's insane these are random and some people more between ten or twelve and twenty microns stand a deviation from a perfect circle made by end well not made by end potentially hand it's a mandatory maybe managed by a person maybe a human was managing the process or overseeing the operation and that could also explain the differences in quality between this piece and other pieces that appear very nice when you look at them but under analysis I would conclude that they're they're pretty different tolerance instead of you know ten or fifteen microns it might be a hundred hundred fifty so clearly and that's across all the different measurements so that could be a different a could be different process could be different culture it could be someone at various levels of their skill set maybe they're learning maybe it was a different machine maybe it's a different time period there's a lot of explanations but some of them still don't appear to be done by hand so even the ones you know I'm pretty confident that a lot of these were not made by hand however even in that category there's differentiation so what about a concentricity or other measures so that that that presents metrics that I think it's maybe not as clear what is impressive or what is advanced or what's not why it's important people don't necessarily know how to read those metrics as you know they might not be used to looking at that stuff but we still do see so if we're talking about you know the difference between these two circles we're looking at a deviation in the center points are very circles and so we can see deviations down to you know well under one thousand of an inch but does that distance between the two circles centers so it's the deviation assuming the motivation we both be on the same axis so you're assuming that different circles should be on the same axis because if the intention here is to make a cylinder how close is this thing to a cylinder we've already established that part to the in a plate and the x y plane might be circular or might not be circular we already measured that but how does the overall body is at the same axis same center as the axis but this is deviation or standard deviation this is a standard deviation so why do you have two deviation? Auto when make okay so you're going to period so this is my crisis is thousand of an inch so we see the same and looks precise I don't know you know necessarily how this relates to other forms of manufacturing because we're talking about just these two circles but be interesting to see these metrics on the on the scientists against miss mate ways yeah it would be best real local it would be different because that wasn't the change we can actually feed it as a feeling to the self-term now yes if they provide us the list to you well if they scan it correctly with correct equipment and provide us in STL file doesn't seem like they did that looks like they were using pencil like we're about there is a list you find they provide it it's publicly available I am it let's take a look at it maybe that's another conversation next one more guess yeah so it's you know we can we can expand on this analysis a lot and another interesting you know and another thing way to go is the residuals like what sort of distribution to the residuals take you expect it to be roughly normal do you find it to be a normal distribution um what's the minimax because it is a minimax hit in just a few places which can be realized are where in terror or are the minimax routinely breached but the state of division is a lot lower I don't mean minimax routinely breached I just mean are there a lot of fat tails does the distribution look um look as fat tails basically that would be not what you expect but interesting it could mean something else so was the most extra astonishing finding on this phase was the most unbelievable part of this metric to me it's that every surface has radians so there is no flat surfaces you look at that vase and this not the same as this one I don't know if this one is the same but this could be actually if you look a lot of these days is the lip appears to be flat and it might be a centimeter or a few centimeters in width maintain around and if you look at it it looks flat like oh it's flat nor the interior here that that first cuts it cuts in it looks like two centimeters maybe three quarters of an inch almost looks flat perpendicularly brown but if you actually analyze it there's no flat surfaces in some of these they're all radii there is a radii and it's a big it's a big radii because it looks flat so it will be a huge radii so whatever is polishing this and this is outwardly conveying it jumps up like a bubble the top of the soap bubble what the hell kind of machine could make that what the hell kind of machine could make that and why would you want it why would you need that to be the case now is it's rare it seems it appears to be the case on all the precise vessels are precise in every way like they all have radii and builds their debris as you look opponent you know are no flat surfaces to have no flat surface on a precise waste is that rare because there are a lot of vases with a completely flat neck so here's the answer to the question which is why this project isn't complete as you you know this but we haven't scanned enough and we ignore the ones that don't appear interesting enough so if there's a because it takes time it takes time to scan something to do the work and so if there's a stone object that looks rudimentary looks rough it could be heavily damaged or just doesn't look that precise when you hold it in your hand we might not even scan it or restored yes because it's just showing of the measurements and everything so we have a bias our biases we're looking for them the best ones and so I really keep cancer this enough not every stone vessel that's called pre-diedastic is necessarily precise in any way or is made by machines at all there's probably a lot of them are made because you're unfinished and not even started or you can see the round but it's not held out and it's not yeah it's weird that's right so you know we need more data and we need more museum collaborations because I think it's a very interesting topic for everyone for us and for the museums as well do you want to talk about these so night skyrabe is a youtube channel who usually probably trying to debunk these for example these researchers as well and here the video on your cosmic summit presentation do you want to address any of those claims or or maybe correct something or or explain yourself or explain why he was wrong or you were wrong or sure yeah we we talked about some of these points on them dandetedunkers podcast a week or so ago more than that now two weeks ago I guess and you know I think again like I think I'm not getting knowledge that he's been a lot of time going through these he he made a video on ben and i many other videos and just me and he has responded to all sorts of claims in the past I don't think he's always wrong I think that something he said were wrong or inaccurate or misconstrued based on his interpretation I would I can respect the fact that someone takes a time you do that sure and you know some of his points I think are worth discussing in may not be right or wrong they might just be like different opinions or just ballot topics for consideration going full it so you know again yeah we have bias because we're not scanning the hand made alabas surveyes we could you know we have a few of these as control pieces like what is a handmade piece look like it's like huge numbers we would have this can a few enough precise basis in the picture museum so we can look at a few of those and it'd be interesting to speculate on why they're precise and and and maybe compare them to some of the precise words but that's you know science science cares about that if if we were trying to ascertain how many of the ones that are out there are are accurate precise and I don't think it's a number we can never estimate and there's a few reasons for that but I think the biggest reason is that there are an unknowable number these out there these is important how much I mean it doesn't matter really many of these it could just a question like are they imitated by subsequent cultures quite a bit and when we don't know when these are first made we don't even know when the imitations would have happened because even the imitation seemed to be more precise than or were accurate than these primitive cultures including the Egyptians had the ability to make so even the ones that are not impressive probably could not have been made by our recent ancestors when I say recent I mean up to five thousand be say it seems like most of these were made before even the ones that are less precise and less accurate now most of the adults that are out there that were uncovered by anybody legally illegally illegally official unofficial before the regime in government and Egypt most things are not in museums most things are in private hands that's always been the case of very might a very small minority are in museums all things in store houses in Cairo or other places on each in Egypt right but not even owned by the government is my point is that people have been looting these sites per thousands of years the Greeks the ancient Greeks were taking things out of Egypt in 1520 BC um this stuff has been removed to certain extent and yet is still being found like if you go and we're competing in look up to car you'll see excavations every year 2020 2024 2023 2022 we still find things all the time um case in point about 10 years ago they found this entire area region is the car but they found eight million animal mummies eight million mummies of people's pets eight million that's the size of like one of the larger cities under but in total in an huge exploration area in one area eight million mummies of animals we still find mummies in cigar all the time there was millions of people mummified in placed in these areas all around cigar around the no crapplestors miles of caverns and tunnels in chambers all under the desert everywhere and a lot of them have never been found so there's so much there because people have been living here for so long um that most of the most finds go unreported most by far most but in my opinion if it would be just one it's already a smoking gun evidence with these metrics and analytics that something is missing from our historical records and knowledge right something isn't right that wasn't so legally so the official digs are going to be coming on to a site long after the unofficial digs have already happened so that easiest stuff to find the best stuff would be looted case and point other case and point value the kings everyone knew where value the kings was every single thing was broken into a looted except for two in common why because there was a landslide that concealed the entrance people didn't know it was there all the other ones that you knew were there that were heavily barricaded and fortified and buried under turns and tons of metric tons of metric tons of rubble easily you know people in there for a few months and it's cleared out and they rob everything in there so you know we're we're looking at filter data we're looking at a bias we're looking at stuff that that remains and we're still finding precision artifacts um you know what when we were talking about when lightscape said about cacara yeah he criticized you know my the story I was telling at that cosmic summit was was really something that got me into this and it always struck me as odd the fact that somebody found 30 or 40 or whatever thousands and thousands of these in one place and they're obviously impressive you know this one is like one of the least impressive ones I've seen there are obviously impressive and the historical timeline the main story and point of view is that they took two years or more several effort at least two years right scientists I guess meant prove that just to get a rudimentary shape if nothing you know not not not to mention the polishing and the the finishing they had difficulties once the grand broke or break and got still it's in the game takes a long time so the point is in there are skilled you know their scientists quote unquote their skilled people don't want to be a very skilled stone maism who made this there you go yeah does she get paid minimum wage is she paid slave labor I have no idea which was she paid for this probably but we can we can we can it's not possible that these were made by slaves you don't take skilled men the types of our people the types of criminals that come out of prison are made to digdishes like slaves that don't have any skills that were born into slavery and not trained for to do anything they could have skilled slaves actually that's also could be a point that they have had some people in slavery who are skilled head skills but it's not the important part well the union the common argument is that they spent 30 years perfecting their skill it just seems it doesn't seem logical that that slaves are cheap labor would be making they're skilled people so what's the value of someone's output so if someone is not producing for the rest of this society you're paying to keep that personal life okay so cultural of surplus or excess in in the cultural and in the environment is keeping that personal life sustaining them paying for this work it's just like any modern culture has arts and has other leisure activities right they're able to do that because of the fruits of other people's labor effectively at the end of the day so these objects if that person is being paid to do something for a few years it's valuable be some anything doesn't really matter if we're doesn't matter recurrence you were talking about my up my example is just to get people a sense of in modern times in western you know in western society in Europe and in America and places like that what's the value of someone's time over a couple years relative to their own culture's GDP relative to what average person earns and I said a couple of $8000 the price of a small house lately of the local something big that took someone several years to make it's expensive and so if you have if you have an own a lot of these things you wouldn't just have has a really put them somewhere easily lost to time to grave robbing you know not protected that was my point was that if there was so many of these things there's there seem to be the person that owned them wouldn't just like casually be like I was put the more air because the value of that would be huge huge billions of dollars let the GDP of a small country and I would I would definitely stand behind that the question that was raised was lawyer found 30 or 40 thousand stone visas he he X about over two two-year period of time when he was when he's superseded the people in the Egypt that were doing the dig but I think there were also French or archaeologist and the point was that these weren't all hard stone igneous rock some of the ralibaster and yes alibaster is found there I don't know if that number of the story of 40 thousand number includes alibaster not he may not have so it's just two-month was less than that I think my counterpoint was that he was there for two years he took over from another official excavation that was there for 19 years and I don't I have never seen any documentation on what was found that so it's probably that anything that was found then was is lost to time was put into private hands sold government humans we don't know there is a seem to be good records of it and not to mention sarcarah is a site that everybody knows about was absolutely looted many many times over thousands of years by even the moments so it's not ludicrous to say that there were hundreds of thousands of these put there by him will tap in josek I think the calculation of the nice curve regarding the museum collection is in pieces but not so correct because for example he was searching for pre-dynastic keywords in the I think it was the British museum's collection online collection and sometimes his bases are attributed to the fourth third or even the sixth dynasty the first couple of dinosaurs is there are much more not significantly more but there are much more than the nice curve found and also he did not take the private collections into account well you can't but the word pre-dynastic isn't used all the time when it when it when a museum says you know in a car to it might not say pre-dynastic it just says the car so searching for pre-dynastic's not gonna hit that listen it's it's I've seen thousands of these just at the Cairo museums collection thousands Cairo museumist thousands they have right now this funders on display oh they know they have thousands because they rotate them in and out they have store rooms all over the place there's entire sites that look like prisons that are dedicated to contemporaries they have thousands like we were just there you can still step on broken shards yeah be there down in in the step around in there that's a hundred years after this excavation took place yeah and there's still remaining are taken out and that's the torus are stepping on wasn't it a special permission to go I've been there like six or seven times it's not that special yeah but for you for me it was but I mean it's not awful and that's you pay a few extra dollars okay special permission just need the prices yeah yeah but it's probably not available for for general tourists sure but either way there's a lot of these things um the whole back fill on around the entrance it's made up of pirated and still in bustle shards right with layers of dirt sand on top of it to allegedly to protect it which I think makes sense hopefully you can serve it um I don't think it doesn't I think it doesn't really matter because if it's 40,000 100,000 cares if it's more than 100 or more than one we have to figure something out we have some work to do and some research that is that I think we all can agree on the only point I was making is that sheer number of these things for one person to have spent time collecting and then to just leave them there like that um in a place that um whether or not you think it was protected it wasn't a secret there's a huge pure like working where he put it right so it's not it wasn't like every like a pirate with bears or treasure on some uncharted Caribbean island it was put in a place that everybody knows about um but they be not everyone has access to sure but I you know my point was uh not that it was difficult because he didn't make them so he in that's it wasn't as a fairly aware of how long it took you're talking about Joseph who will be just a pyramid a demo type they're the ones that collect these things the archaeological accepted explanations that they collected these and they were there's graffiti on it from Kings 500 years before them and armor others so they didn't make them in the evil type museum in Sakara they are actually stating that it was probably they were heirlooms and inherited and collected down in the basement of the stack permit yeah so they just were um they didn't value them as much as the person to made them and the people that would have made them by primitive hands would have valued because they found them they maybe took them from people that were living in the area or other people up and down Egypt or again these things are up and down the the Nile and Egypt so the the manner in which they collected them um matters they were the king and they it just wasn't that valuable to them he acquired you know thousands and thousands of these by any sense of the word thousands and thousands they also collected the alibest to bronze he did to you so so that was my point was that is he had any idea of how difficult it was to make these and thought as we do that it was manual like this over years and years and years and years and years with all the cast-offs with all the difficulty of machining will fill the elaborate controls that would have been into making them if he had a sense that this was high to him alien technology high technology of a different culture with access to advanced machining and engineering and science I don't think he would have just collected them so have hazardly they're throwing them into boxes and the does he made it so much buddy oils enough to life yes everybody needs that depending on how much you party and be years can he's full of guinness yeah yeah I know so that was my point it wasn't that important but to me that always struck me I was like wait what are you seeing the archaeological records says this but yet the manner in which these were collected and then left here doesn't compute and this guy didn't make them and all the evidence is showing that the dynamics didn't make things at all not none of the first early nine season they these they did not make them they didn't have the tool set clearly they didn't have the tools to make them and they never did again even if they had made them for two years does the view just why they didn't make it again why is the old one which is the best quality and precision in that violates four based dating if you find a vase for 4500 pc and then another one that you're gonna say is now 3000 BC but it's the same for you can't say that this this Egyptian king made it for the ferro already observant because you've already dated a similar one to four thousand BC so that even violates the own four based dating principles that we did we date things based on the way they look and where they're found i think that they can take the materials they ignore the quality they ignore the difference in in worksmanship it's all completely ignored in the informed based dating so it's it's it's hypocritical and it's just it's not intelligent but it's it's what they had at the time so they had in Victorian era 1850s there was another point when the night's club said something above modern rock crystal wazes and these were all made with abrasion and this is nice to say and yet those vazes are probably precise and nice but rock crystal is homogeneous material right yeah I haven't I think you mentioned one spherical object we would want to see you know the scanned data the point-clad data are it there are spherical great things like heroes so in theory in the park it's rolling on a tiny layer of order or something but we are talking about geometry which is much more much more complicated than just this fear right right but if you can make a precise sphere and the new want to change it to you know run into a neck and a lip and everything else like I think if you can make a sphere down to the slope of the precision you should be able to make other components of a vessel to the same as sphere as much more complicated than a a cylinder yeah so I listen I don't think we can put a limit or boundary condition on my blood possible was not possible like any particular person unless we're talking about orders of magnitude difference what's possible by in was possible with machine is orders of magnitude different what we we have been able to do in modern times it's only the product of the last two decades plus fifty sixty seven years max okay so we only are only at the point now we can talk about these levels of precision because of the product but every minute happened after World War II effectively and that's how we've evolved as a culture so I think that just points to the fact that there was a highly there was a highly advanced civilization in the age and passed along before the nine as a Egyptians that's I don't think that's controversial and I would stand by that to the day I die I think that's I think the evidence from for that is everywhere a lot of times it's circumstantial or statistical and it's difficult to prove one for one as a as a surifiable fact like how do you logically prove that you don't know I think we'll we'll think about that that answer over time and to how how advanced were these people I don't know but they have the ability to make stone objects in accordance with tolerances that resulted in accuracy that that minics or you know exceedingly normally do today in metal and approaches that or or matches that what we do in super specific objects like for defense industry purposes but to us to the modern factory to create a great phase right yeah well we've had I mean since we started talking about this subject you know back in 2017 and 2018 and and engineers and machinists have looked at this and expressed all in the in the level of accuracy we see a number of people have said let me see if I can make this and generally they come back and say no I'm not allowed I can't use I can't operate the machine to mock I'm not going to be able to do this because the machines are just I program it they're designed for different types of modules materials and they can serve it as that the you know the economic cost will be way too great and you can't quote someone a price to make something that you don't know how to make but doesn't mean you can't it just means that you've never have and you and you don't know how much it's going to cost or what the opportunity cost is you know we can't make something else while we're making this and the machine's going to break it and it causes this much money fix it until people are like there's no point why because of few people are interested about Egypt well I don't care about it so that's that's the mentality I think as more and more scientists and machinists that engineers get involved and interested in the subject will find some answers but hopefully find someone that's able to replicate this today you know using modern machinery that the approaches are exceeded this one specific industry or or nothing does a accompanying China could get close enough no that was a generic ran-off shop in China about attempted it and it was you know their accuracy was it was about 500's of an inch so in in circularity circularity yeah so there you know it wasn't I would say it's not particularly close it was in excess of what's required by hand but it was you know one and a half hours of magnitude away so 50 times less precise then the STL files were initially showing about the granite so the granite is but two and a half hours of magnitude away from what CTO files so not I would say not close not that close no but they were able to produce something that looks visually good and they were not able to hollow out the interior they just cordially all the interior so I mean I did a reasonably good job that was that was the best of their abilities but as they said to me and these are granite specialists we wouldn't make this in granite we would make this out of marble because it's it's a lot easier but they gave it a shot and this is a this is a community that's been working in granite for at least 2000 years but what was the answer for the interior I mean why they just re-adult and not trying to because it like we don't have machines I can hollow out the interior of a hard it can be a rock like this we do not have capabilities of making of hollowing out the interior we can cordial it cordial the tubular drill right so the entire drill bit is itself a cylinder so you have a vertical you know pressure that's maintained when you want to hollow something out first you have to get it inside there so you can't lower in a bit that's a circular bit that's wider than the mouth reference open the mouth is narrower than the body so how do you get it in there and expand it and use that the nice good I've showed us some tools when they were making these pro resist with all of us their wages very nice modern art thing I don't know the Kimmel or Krimmel or I don't know the name of the guy who made these wages have you seen that? Most of them are still in their nature they're mostly not they mostly don't feature a narrow top and the body that's actually the minority this guy was using some kind of L shaped tool to carve out their hell of the interior but that was not the ignorance room you could do that you have a lot of vibration because the tool is going to be the pressure is going to be one sided right so your access is going to have a lot of pressure there's going to be a lot of vibration friction heat I doesn't seem possible granted I think an alibaster yeah well it's clearly possible if people have done it but but it's also not the alibaster is also not made to and I would say any sort of high-level accuracy it's made and it looks okay but you can you can generally look at it with a naked eye human eye and see that it's visible not not symmetrical it's not perfect I mean an alibaster which is much softer yeah so you know I I'm looking forward to you know the next few museum visits and me too hopefully we'll get some good data it's really be quite an adventure yep yep but we have to catch up laying soon but you can choose a camera and tell the alibans where they can find you you can't find me anywhere I'm just kidding way we have you know what we have interesting data that's worth publishing or repeating it will be out there you know for now you know check out Carolinas podcast check out Ben and our chart decks you know Matt Bell we talked about as a podcast called limitless that we have brothers of a serpent we talked about these issues and these topics Dan that I don't care as as approach the subject of numerous times changed his mind and changes mind the arts the art of fact foundation which is how we do our artwork and research well we'll have some information to release it will be doing some public events in the future but for now you know reach out if you have any questions if you want to make a vase Adam at artifact foundation.org yeah if you can make a vase and want to we'd love to have you love to have you try good luck thanks for the conversation and the figure side finished that and catch our plane let's get some vases can
