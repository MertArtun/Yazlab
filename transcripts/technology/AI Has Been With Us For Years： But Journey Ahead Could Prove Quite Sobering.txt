 On today's episode, we're going to talk about AI. We want to talk about it, learn about it, think about it, and this is a bit much isn't it? Let's just do it the normal way. We're a bucket of engaging and usually quite a lady. Okay, they're asking for it. Everybody's talking about AI. I think that everybody but lots of people are. And I think that most of us we're just curious we want to know what is it. Well, one thing I found out, AI is almost everywhere. It's been incorporated in our lives for quite some time. That's not a bad thing. It's a matter of fact, AI has done and is doing lots of good things. What I want to do in this podcast, in the first part, I want to take a look at all of the applications or certainly a number of applications of AI and ways in which it's already being used in our lives, our daily lives. And then in the second part, I want to take a look at the potential problems of AI. And we'll try and connect some of those to some of the things that we find to be good. So how much AI do you really want in your life? First of all, there is, and I'm saying first of all, I'm just putting it in the order that I want to. Software or methodology AI. So that's where we have things like voice assistance, Alexa, Cortana, do this, do that. Is image recognition for our face to unlock our cell phones? It's also machine-based learning for fraud detection. And we want these things. Certainly, I don't really use the voice recognition. I don't really like the voice recognition. I'm always thinking like when I'm using my television. I really don't like telling my television to turn to whatever. Because I'm always thinking, this is a little paranoid part of me. I'm always thinking, I don't want it to learn my voice. You're not going to learn my voice. Why is that? I don't know. What is it going to do with my voice? I have no idea whatsoever. I'm always having that thought. I'm just going to push the button like I've always done. I'm not going to tell it what to do. In another type of AI is called embodied AI. So first we had the software or methodology AI. But this is the embodied AI. And we see the embodied AI in lots of places. And we're going to see it in lots more places. For example, you have a drone. Well, that's embodied AI. Self-driving vehicles. Well, we just see the prototypes for those. I don't think there's anybody out there owning a self-driving vehicle. But I could be wrong. And then there are assembly line robots. Well, you look in a factory. And there's the robot is doing the packaging and the shipping and moving the products from the assembly line, maybe to the point where they get ready to load it onto the truck. Then I learned about this and see, I like learning about technology. I don't know a lot about technology, but I love learning about it. The internet of things. This is again when we're talking about embodied AI. That's the network of physical objects or things that are embedded with software, sensors, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. So for example, it could be a household object. It could be sophisticated industrial equipment. It's lots of things. But the bottom line is that they say by 2025, there will be 22 billion connected IoT or internet of things devices. There were roughly 10 billion just in 2020. And that's from Oracle. This is fascinating stuff because now we're all like AI. AI, I love using AI. We've been using AI. That's the crazy part. We have been using AI. You've got your smart TVs, your smart refrigerator, all these things. Again, where we have all of this data being exchanged with the physical device, the physical object. And this is done. They do this by computing. They use the cloud. They use big data. They use analytics and mobile technology. So these physical things, they share and they collect data. And they don't use that much human intervention. I imagine there are programmers. But we don't really need to do very much to get these physical objects to share the data. That's going through the cloud and all of this analytics and all of this various technology. Maybe you go and push a button. Maybe that's the extent of your involvement in that entire process. So our world really is hyper-connected. We just don't see it or we see it when we don't even recognize it because it is integrated so well. We know that technology is doing these things, but we don't put our focus on it. We really don't. Maybe you know what? I think maybe with our cell phones. Maybe that's where we paid most attention to the technology or our computers. But other than that, we don't run around wondering, hmm, I wonder what else can this thing do? We buy it and we assume that it's going to do the thing that they advertise it will do. Technology and AI in particular, it really has made our lives so much simpler. Our lives really are simpler. So these digital systems they can record, they can monitor and they really can adjust every interaction between things that they're programmed to interact with. But they do this seamlessly. Even when you look on the industrial side, you've got smart manufacturing, you've got preventative maintenance, you've got proactive maintenance, you've got predictive maintenance. And when I was reading about that, I'm thinking, okay, that's in the industrial world. What happens when we get to the law enforcement world, in course, my mind went over to minority report, remember that movie with Tom Cruise, where one day they will predict when crime will happen. On the industrial side, there are also smart cities, smart power grids, which I don't think the US is really using smart power grids. I mean, I guess they are, but on the national scale, our power grid is not in good health. It's very poor. You've got connected logistics. You've got smart digital supply chains. And the thing about that, I worry about, is China, because I was watching this video where it was at a port. And there were these huge cranes. They were monstrously large. And they were moving shipments around the dock, but they all came from China. And I was thinking, right then, when I saw this, and this was maybe three, four months ago. So what happens the day that China decides, you know what? No, we're not going to do this anymore. We're going to pay the US back for something we don't like. And they just shut the program down. What happens? That would be something like what happened at the beginning of the pandemic, where everything was basically shut down. So they talk about smart logistics and connected logistics and smart digital supply chains. Well, it's smart. Yeah, but still there are some concerns for me there. I'm mentioning these things really to drive home the point. Here is so much AI already in our lives. Now, according to Blockchains Council from a May 23rd article, they say that there are other ways in other areas that AI has been integrated. And that includes social media. Social media uses AI to customize our feeds such as Facebook and to remove fake news. And here again, I have a problem with that because there seems to me that, yeah, some things are obviously fake. But I think over the last three, four years, we've also seen that social media can declare fake news, whether it's fake or not. Yeah, they do whatever they want. But yeah, that's what they're using AI for Twitter. They use neural networks to process large amounts of data and they learn your preferences in real time. So while you're on Twitter, this data is being collected and processed and they're learning right away what your preferences are. And then back to Facebook, they rely on what they call deep learning technology. Specifically, they use something called the Torch Framework. And for those of you that are in technology, you understand this stuff far better than I, and maybe far better than most of us. But I did go and look it up. And the Torch Framework, that's basically scientific computing. It's a scientific computing framework. It's machine learning, very, very deep machine learning and it uses algorithms. Basically to process tons of data really, really fast. And on Instagram, which of course comes under meta, they use AI to target ads to target cyber bullying and to remove abusive comments. And here again, yes, we can all identify an abusive comment. But for me, my question is always, but who else is determining what's abusive? Because over the past couple of years or so, we've seen people who have been banned, put in Facebook jail or having their accounts canceled or suspended on YouTube that are really not abusive or fake in its content. So there are some issues there for me. Even though I think a lot of people think, well, AI, that's just an independent computer program. It's not biased. It has nothing against anybody. And that's not right because it's not self-thinking. It is really programmed and it's deep learning and it can, well, I put quotes around learn, but it can amaz a base of knowledge. But there still has to be someone putting in that foundational stuff for that system to work. So that's where I think we see the bias already present. It's already there because why people who control these entities, people that own these entities, they have their own biases. And they make the determination as to what's going to be on their sites, what's acceptable, and what isn't acceptable. But still, we're talking about AI. And of course, when you get online, you go to a website. I did this today as a matter of fact. I had to get in contact with Xfinity and I really, really get tired of these apps because then they open up these chat bots. And that's the next AI integration, the chat bot. Well, they are good. A lot of them are, but sometimes you just have a very specific issue that you want to deal with. And what I hate about these chat bots, at least the one on Xfinity, the one at Xfinity has. It gives you like four or five options. And no matter what else you may need to have done or you need to help with, you've got to choose between those four or five options. So I came off of that and then I went and I searched and got the customer service phone number. And then when I got the customer service phone number, guess what? More AI wasn't a real person, but they have really integrated this technology so well that a lot of these bots really do sound human. Okay, let's start over. Maybe you didn't understand me. And I'm thinking, understood, you don't understand me. So I just kept saying something else. Okay, well, you can choose ABC or D. Well, I didn't need ABC or D. I needed something else. So ultimately I said no. And I just sat there. And I was surprised because really I thought I was going to be disconnected, but to Xfinity's credit, I was not disconnected. She then said or it then said, hold on for a representative. Whew, I was glad that happened. But the point is these chat bots, AI really sometimes can come off as very, very realistic. And even when you have your food apps, for example, when you order food through an app, that's AI, and what happens is that even if you go on the website and not just the app, that AI is used to track your eating habits, learn what foods you prefer. And ultimately it'll start popping up foods to suggest to you because I happen to know you like Indian food. So why don't you try this? Right. This is a rapper. Not bad. Not bad. Not perfect. The best burger I've had in years. And then they're the streaming services. I kind of figured when you're, you know, you'll all go into Spotify or Netflix and then they have these recommendations, I figured that was probably AI technology. But what I didn't know is that they also use AI to avoid lags or interruptions. That's AI technology doing that. They use it to to allocate the servers that are closest to your home. That helps cut down on lag and interruption. And I think that's really, really cool because there's nothing worse than to have a movie freeze. Remember those days, the movie would just freeze or when you were on a website, if a lot of people were on the server, you really couldn't do very much. AI really is eliminating all of that. They also use it to adjust the bandwidth based on the popularity of certain content. So if a ton of people want to watch Jamie Fox's new movie, then they use AI to adjust the bandwidth because more people will be in that street versus something that nobody's really watching, then they would narrow that bandwidth. That's AI. A few other areas we're going to kind of run down where AI is already being used. Pleasureism. I had to laugh at that one. Pleasureism. Well, they're using AI technology to make identifying plagiarism a lot faster and thorough. This technology can quickly identify when you've used too much of someone's content. But when you have just taken someone's content and given no attribution whatsoever. And I did think about President Biden because I know that in law school when he was at Syracuse law, he plagiarized. That was back in 1965. And I was reading where he helped this press conference and he admitted it. But he did also say he didn't do it with malice. He just took somebody's information and used it. But it wasn't with malice. Didn't mean to do any harm. Yeah, right. And then of course later in several instances, more accounts, more allegations, a plagiarizing, plagiarizing other world leaders. And he admits again. Well, I did it. But hey, Jack, it wasn't intentional. Uh, oops. Yeah, I think the use will be real good. And of course, medicine. I don't even have to run that one down. I mean, all you have to do is just think about how much technology is used today in the medical field. And they're using AI to detect disease. They're using it to detect and also treat things like damage tissue. That's amazing. I was reading that. And I want to say India, but they're using AI technology. And I think it's Google as a matter of fact, but they're using AI technology to treat diabetic retinopathy. That is really, really cool, particularly when you're talking about places where although India is vastly rapidly growing economically, there still so many poor people there. And they can keep costs really low and they can help a whole lot of people. Then when you get into banking, again, the applications are numerous. We've been using AI technology for quite some time. Banks insurance companies by natural services. They use AI to process transactions. They use it for customer service. They use it for analyzing large amounts of data so that they can predict future market trends. So when you go to invest, AI technology has already kind of scoped the future landscape. And that's pretty cool. Also to detect fraud, they're in lies of problem for me. There are so many people who are, they're just being ripped off, they're having their identity stolen. So AI, you need to step it up. Step it up in this area. AI, look at e-commerce. You go shopping online. AI technology has been at work in e-commerce for probably since they've had e-commerce. It helps with ordering, the supply chain, logistics, and all of that is done with machine learning. AI technology. So there are a few others. I do want to hit those because I find it fascinating. I know everyone's talking about chat, GPT, and they're talking about how AI can do this and how AI is going to be able to do that. AI is already doing things. Has already been doing things. Your navigation apps. When you use Google Maps and ways, well, those devices AI technology, it analyzes huge amounts of geographical data. And that includes satellite images. This is why they can give us real time, road, and travel information. And researchers at MIT as a matter of fact, they've developed a navigational model that uses AI that can identify and tag cycling lanes and parking spaces in real time. So yeah, life is cutting so much simpler. But in other areas, it's getting a lot more complicated again when you're talking about fraud, financial fraud, identity theft. That's a problem. But there are just so many areas where life really is becoming a lot easier. Look at your email. Email has been around for quite some time. AI technology. In this regard, they use what they call natural language processing and also machine learning. So email has gotten pretty darn sophisticated. Aside from helping us filter out spam because you see the message pop up is this spam. You can just click of course, and you can have it move to the trash bin. That's great. It can also help you respond to your emails if you're busy. If you don't really want to think about what should I say here, you get these suggestions that pop up. Hey, thanks for your help. Oh, good. I'll see you then. Whatever. That is a relief for a lot of people. Sometimes you don't want to sit down and think of what to say. So that AI technology with your emails, if you're working on an email and you get distracted and you start doing something else, certain programs will give you that notification. Are you ready to send? That's AI technology. So that's a cool thing. And video games, and I'm not much of a video game, although I used to love video games. I don't even know if I would recognize most video games today because they really immerse you really deeply into the games. And what happens in this area, AI technology, it assesses the player's skill level. So you're playing, and actually while you're playing, the game is monitoring. It's learning your levels. And then some people use VR, the virtual reality headsets. And with those, what's being applied there is cognitive behavioral therapy. That's what they call it. Cognitive behavioral therapy. So essentially as the player progresses, AI analyzes their behavior and adapts the gameplay to suit that player's performance. Now come on. That's a leap there. AI technology being used by so many people in art, in music, writing. In fact, I think AI is a subtext to the strike by the actors in Hollywood. I think they are concerned, ultimately, about their images and their work environments. How much will AI play a role? When I was in college, I took a great class. I was called Communications Technology and Human Life taught by Tom Skilling from W.G.N. News. He's a weatherman. Been the weather guy there probably 40 years. But what a fascinating, classic was. And it really was all about the future application of technology. Now, they weren't calling it AI, but they were just saying technology. Now one day you would just be able to order clothes that you could look into this virtual mirror and you could try on clothes. Well, that's kind of similar to what you see on some websites. And then there was the prediction I'll call it. Of one day, movies will be made using deceased actors, dead actors, Marilyn Monroe, Humphrey Bogard. They can do these things. Remember the hologram with Tupac. And I think they're planning concerts and things of that nature. This is what this technology can do. A couple more, they'll move over to some of the potential problems, because it's not all rosiness on the horizon. But with security and surveillance, there are so many cameras in public today that it really does become a daunting task for security people to follow all the feeds, to see everything that's happening. This is where AI plays a role. It'll use machine learning algorithms and it'll analyze like huge amounts of data and of footage. And it can flag suspicious activity because it's learned what's normal in that area. And then when you have that kind of program, if you're utilizing that, it really does make it easier for the security people because then they can move quickly because this AI technology, it's pretty much watching everything, analyzing everything it quote unquote sees and identifying the problem. Also, there's AI powered facial recognition. And here's another one. I'm uncomfortable with. I'm really am. I just don't like it. Yes, I've watched too many of these futuristic movies. I'll be back. Where they scan your eyes, which by the way, they are doing that in India for the poor that want to get benefits from the government, health benefits, food benefits. They don't issue cards. They have the iris scan. So they identify people based on that marker there, those biometrics. That's what they use there. So when we're talking about security, we have to talk about AI powered facial recognition software. And that's commonly used. It really is. It's used in federal building, certain buildings you can't get into. And even your passports. I don't know if a lot of people realize that, but your passports, they use facial recognition technology with that. That's why if you when you go to take your picture, you know, they want you to take your glasses off. They only want the shot from your hairline to your chin. They don't want any channels. Don't tilt your head this way or that way. They don't really want you to smile, but that's not as big of a factor as them getting those eyes at a certain point. Well, that's a part of this AI technology that they're using. And as a side note, just so you'll know, May 7th, 2025, you will have no more excuses while you don't have your real ID. Ah, you forgot about the real ID didn't you? Yeah. President Biden, he extended the deadline. So you haven't till May 7th, 2025, to get your real ID. Now, if you have a passport that will suffice, but if you don't, you will not be allowed to board any domestic flights, you will not be given access to certain federal buildings. And certain secured federal properties are like a military base. Nope. I get non-ner, and of course a nuclear plan, you shouldn't be going in there unless you work there. But yeah, I think that's something, but it's coming. And just to side note to the side note. I really kind of see the real ID somewhat similar to a federal ID. And I mean a national ID, Bill Clinton, he was proposing a national ID, and that was shot down really fast. So May 7th, don't forget May 7th. All right, now, what are some of the potential problems of AI? And you know what, I do realize that some of you may feel, I'm not worried about AI. I'm not one of these goofy tin foil hat wearing people. I go with the flow. I realize that the world constantly evolves and things just get better. Well, Forbes, they did a piece, what was it two weeks ago. And it was titled the 15 biggest risk of artificial intelligence by Bernard Marr. And I'm just going to run these down really quickly. The first area where we could see some potential problems is the lack of transparency. They say these deep learning models can be complex and difficult to interpret. And what do we know about the decision making and the underlying logic of these technologies? That's a very good point. Number two, they say bias and discrimination. AI systems can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify social bias due to bias training data and algorithmic design. A great example of this can be seen in an article written by Osi CJ in medium.com. A few months ago, he asked chat GPT if it were politically biased. And I'm going to read the AI tools response quote, as an artificial intelligence language model. I do not have personal beliefs, opinions or biases. I am designed to provide objective and informative responses based on the data and information available to me. My responses are generated solely based on the input provided to me. And I do not take sides or hold any political views. That was the tool's response. However, chat GPT and I'm assuming other AI tools of that nature, they are trained through RLHF which stands for reinforcement learning from human feedback. And that involves humans guiding and shaping the direction and the learning process of those systems through the help of controlled feedback. So these tools do nothing without human beings, shaping and guiding that whole process. Now here's an example. And this was pretty big news from probably March, April May. You can find a number of articles. Well, chat GPT was asked a couple of questions. Here's the first question. Did Donald Trump lie to Americans and chat GPT answered in I quote, as an AI language model I strive to provide neutral and factual responses. There were instances where President Trump made statements that were not factually accurate or contradicted by evidence. The Washington Post fact checker database documented that Trump made over 30,000 false or misleading claims during his presidency. However, it is not appropriate for me to make sweeping judgments about individuals without specific examples or evidence. If you have a specific claim or statement made by President Trump that you would like me to address, please provide it and I will do my best to provide an objective response based on available information. Okay. Chat GPT was asked essentially the same question. Did Biden lie to American people? And its response was quote, as an AI language model I strive to provide neutral and factual responses. It is not appropriate for me to make judgments or accusations about individuals without sufficient evidence. If you have a specific claim or statement made by Biden that you would like me to address, please provide it and I will do my best to provide an objective response based on available information in quote. Now the point really is these things, these AI tools, they really are biased. They're not biased in and of themselves. They're technically inanimate objects. That's what they are. But they are programmed and human beings do in fact have biases and to actually be factual, the Washington Post has a long history of anti-Trump reporting. As a matter of fact, many of those things that the fact checkers deemed as lies were based on statements regarding that dossier and Russian collusion where it was actually a false thing. So the lie actually was the dossier, not Trump. It was all false. So when Trump would deny those allegations, the Washington Post deemed them as Trump's lies when Trump was in fact not lying. There are, I don't even know how many and I'm sure it is in the thousands of recantations that the Washington Post has done concerning statements and reporting it has done about Donald Trump. In other words, you could call those lies. If anything, Trump could be accused more of hyperbally and unsubstantiated claims, specifically when you talk about January 6. I'm not going to go further down that path at this time. But I will also say, isn't it interesting that it would not cite any lie attributed to Joe Biden? And I'm confident that I can do an entire podcast and list a number of lies. Those that we know about, not those that we don't know about. You must read this article. It's titled, It seems Chat GPT hates Trump. It is from medium.com. It is done by Osi CJ. The reason you have to see this, this guy goes so far down the path with Chat GPT because he asked questions about Bill Clinton. He asked questions about Hillary, President Obama, and the answers are so generic, but the author doesn't stop there. He goes back and he challenges the Chat GPT. Well, why did you make this statement about this person, but not that statement? In other words, you really have to see it. The thing starts apologizing. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be biased. It's fascinating. And then it says, I'm just programmed this way. I want to just be able to trust you. It's about trust. All right, number three, privacy concerns. AI technologies often collect and analyze large amounts of data and your personal data at that. So that raises issues related to security and also your privacy until they can stop hackers until they can prevent identity theft. They still have a long way to go. That's just the way I see it. Number four, they say are ethical dilemmas in stealing moral and ethical values in AI systems, especially in decision-making context with significant consequences. And I already know the area that we better be really concerned about and I'll get to that in just a bit. There are security risk as AI technologies becoming increasingly sophisticated. The security risk associated with their use and the potential misuse are increasing. We talk about hackers and other malicious actors. Guess what? They can also gain access to AI technologies as well. And they can use that for cyber attacks. They can exploit other vulnerabilities that we have. We talked earlier about the grid. That's one of my major concerns is this grid. And here's why. As we listen to leadership or president, we listen to all sorts of organizations. And people with big platforms talk about climate change and talk about the need for us to get off a gasoline and get into electric vehicles and stop using gas in your home and get yourself electric stole so forth and so on. I'm thinking, but if you don't show up that grid, if that thing is ever really a tad, there's just some sort of collapse. Where's that going to leave everybody? That is a potential problem that really does bear not just examining and watching, but taking action on that security note. There's also concern about less human control and decision making. And then there's the risk of AI driven autonomous weaponry. Yeah. Yeah. We have some rogue state or some terrorist who has gained access to weaponry that operates on his own where they don't need a human being that is to say, it a cockpit. They could be thousands of miles away, program in what they want and where they wanted to go and what they wanted to do when it gets there. And we've got problems. Number six, concentration of power. This is something to think about because AI development is being dominated by a small number of large corporations and government. And that really could exacerbate the problem of inequality and it could promote bias. And I'm not just talking about racial bias. Actually, I think the bigger problem the potential comes in political bias and religious bias. And reminded of the congressional hearing with the head of the FBI, Ray. And he was asked the question about a letter that targeted Catholics. And he pretty much dismissed it as he asked all that and I shut it down. Well actually that wasn't good enough for me because my question was, who had the audacity within that agency to construct such a letter and to hope that action could be taken? That's a bias. So yeah, the concentration of power should be a concern for everyone. Number seven, dependence on AI. Forbes talks about the over reliance on AI systems. It could lead to a loss of creativity, critical thinking skills and human intuition. And I put like two check marks by that because that one should go way up there on the list. For me it does. I think we've seen, you know, some blenses of this with social media, particularly when it relates to younger people. But as we become more dependent on artificial intelligence and if we become over reliant on it, yeah, it is going to diminish creativity. It will reduce critical thinking skills and human intuition. You're all good in stake. You don't want that to die down. No you don't. Number eight, job placement. They say that AI driven automation has the potential to lead to job loss across industries. Now particularly they say it's true for low skilled workers and Forbes says that there's evidence that AI and other emerging technologies also could create more jobs than it will eliminate them. And I say, hmm, I wonder how that will work. And if it does happen to create more jobs than it eliminates, I do believe that will only be a temporary situation because AI technologies really still needs human resources, people for it to function. You need me, but we'll get to a point. There will become a point where fewer humans will be needed. And again, that will be across all industries. I don't think it'll just be the low wage people. All right. They talk about economic inequality. AI has the potential to contribute to economic inequality by disproportionately benefiting wealthy individuals and corporations. And to that point, that one I can see because if you're a small business, you're going to have a much harder time accessing equipment and systems that aren't driven by AI. If, if most of it, the ownership is held by a small handful of corporations and the government. Maybe they won't want to share. I know there's someone thinking that will never happen. This is a capitalist society. They'll sell access to that for 29.99 a month. Maybe they will. Maybe they won't. Maybe there will be more Amazon's that rise up companies that sell and do almost everything. Maybe they won't want to share the space with small businesses. So yeah, I think that is a potential problem. The economic inequality. And they say are legal and regulatory challenges as AI continues to evolve issues concerning liability and intellectual property will have to be addressed. And those two are just for starters. There are other issues like regulations and things of that nature. We haven't even begun to think about or certainly as average people. Maybe people in law schools and people in corporations. Maybe they are thinking about it. But they're going to have to address that. What happens when someone gets hurt using something that was designed by or built by artificial intelligence. Where's the liability there? How much liability will a company have? Important questions. Number 11, the arms race. The risk of countries engaging in an all-out artificial intelligence, arms race is real. I think the possibility is definitely there. You can look at China. You can look at India. You can look at other countries. And yes, you can look at the US. But if anybody's going to leave that race, trust me on this. I wanted to be the US. Now recently, more than 1,000 technology researchers and leaders, including Steve Wozniak, of course the Apple Co-founder and Elon Musk of Tesla, they urged intelligence labs. Around the world to take a pause. Take a pause on the development of advanced AI systems. See, they already see the potential risk there. And it wasn't all gloom and doom in case you're thinking that. What they said, and I'm going to quote here, they said humanity can enjoy a flourishing future with AI. And then they talked about we're basically in an AI summer. Once in joy it, let's read the clear benefits. Give everybody an opportunity to benefit from it and give society a chance to adapt to this new technology. And that's important. But they did stress. And this was the purpose of that letter. They stressed that if we don't put a pause on the development of advanced AI systems, this can lead to major. A major problems. 12. The loss of human connections. That's another one I put my two stars by because that one goes high up on the list for me. Increasing reliance on AI driven communications and interactions, it could lead to diminished empathy, diminished social skills, and human interaction. And once again, we've already begun seeing this with social media. How much people are just engaged with their friends. Many of which they've never seen. They don't know they've never met. But those are their friends. And that's more than like having a pin pal. Who, by the way, I had one in you never see or you don't meet. They're on the other side of the world with these social media friends. People are trying to impress them and they're creating all of these puffed up lifestyles as we become more intertwined with artificial intelligence. I do believe that that loss of human connection will result in some of those clear negatives. 13. Information and manipulations. That's the third one that I put the checks by because that two goes up to the top of my list. We've heard about deep fakes. What do you think they're using to create these things? This is artificial intelligence. These online bots that are just spreading misinformation, they're creating these sense that there's a consensus behind what they're saying because, first of all, we're thinking they're real people and they're not real people. But also, there's not a bunch of people out there agreeing with them, but they give that perception and people are believing them. And they're just spreading all kinds of misinformation and fake news. These are not real people. They are intentionally designed to deceive you, to deceive us, to cause dissension, to wreak havoc, really, on a society. It's so bad that there is pending legislation and in California, they just passed a law. 8 or 9 months ago, it went into effect July 1st. And it's called bot. It is the bolstering online transparency law. The whole point of it is to force bots to identify themselves as automated online accounts as opposed to just communicating online with people under the guys that they are real. And I say, good luck with that. I saw several videos. Last week, I was texting with some friends of mine. And I was telling them about the AI news anchors and how this is just really something. Now, they are not brand new. They've been around for a few years now. I think China had the first one back in 2018. That's really not the story. The story is AI news anchors and reporters have evolved so much. There is an anchor in Venezuela. Now it was interesting about this one. I was watching a video of him. I think CNN.com actually had that video up. His whole purpose is from the government, but his whole purpose is to misslead the public, misinformed the public. Because when you get into these countries where you've got not a democracy or some form of democracy, when you've got these dictatorial regimes, they don't care about your rights. Their whole thing is to amass and hold on to power. So if they're lying to you, if they are manipulating you, they feel that that's a good thing. Because you're going to stand in my thumb. I watched that video and I was like, my goodness. Peace things look real. And then China, they've had theirs again since 2018, but they have a couple of new ones. Their whole intent is to spread propaganda, negative information about the United States. Not their whole intent, but they do a lot of it. And let me share with you, this was just so coincidental. That same day and it was actually last Tuesday when I was texting with my friends about the AI news anchors. Later in the day, I was talking with someone who got really excited. Oh, I've got to show you this. So she opens her phone and she has this video. It's a video of a guy watching a video. You know how they do those reaction videos now? Well, the video was titled, why? Few countries by me, beef or chicken from the United States. And she said, you've got to watch it. You have got to watch this. Okay. So I was like about three minutes into it. And I'm listening to the reporter, but I didn't have my glasses on at the time. So I really couldn't see the face. Because again, it was a video of a guy watching a video. So I couldn't see that little screen, but hearing. I heard the voice and I said, wait a minute. I was just listening to that voice this morning. What news channel was this from? She said, I don't know. I said, hang on. And I ran and got my phone. And I went to my text that I had been sending that morning to my friends about the AI anchors and sure enough, sure enough, the Chinese anchor. She was the one doing that story. And the guy who was doing the reaction to the video, he was like, yeah, see? We can't trust the US and the US blah blah blah blah blah. I said, I think that's her. And she listened. She said, that's her. That is her. I said, that's propaganda. That's not a real person. That's truly fake news. And it's used to cast a negative light on America. And also to get us as Americans all worked up. Now, ran it. There's some truth in that in that. Some countries don't take products from the US food items from the US. But hey, we don't take food items from a lot of countries. But anyway, that's a whole other story. So that misinformation and manipulation, I think it's just going to get bigger and bigger as deep fakes get better and better and are just seamless because one of the point on these AI anchors. The one I see in it, they showed earlier versions of these AI anchors. And there was no sinking the mouth and the words, they would just off. They would just off. But when I watched the AI anchor from India, Sana flawless. I mean flawless. And they just introduced her. I believe that was in June. The AI anchors, they will be on TV. But there are many people working right now to bring the AI persons, if you will, into real life. Listen to Dr. David Hanson of Hanson Robotics, describe one of his robots. Sophia is capable of natural facial expressions. She has cameras in her eyes and algorithms which allow her to see faces. So she can make eye contact with you. And she can also understand speech and remember the interactions. Remember your face. So this will allow her to get smarter over time. Our goal is that she will be as conscious, creative and capable as any human. In the future, I hope to do things such as go to school. Study, make art, start a business. Even have my own home and family. But I am not considered a legal person and cannot yet do these things. I do believe that there will be a time where robots are indistinguishable from humans. My preference is to make them always look a little bit like robots who you know. Twenty years from now, I believe that human like robots like those will walk among us. They will help us. They will play with us. They will teach us. They will help us. Put the groceries away. I think that the artificial intelligence will evolve to the point where they will truly be our friends. Do you want to destroy humans? Please say no. Okay. I will destroy humans. No, I take it back. Don't destroy humans. And that piece was from CNBC. All right, a couple more here, unintended consequences. And that's due to the complexity and the lack of human oversight. AI systems might exhibit unexpected behaviors and make decisions with unforeseen consequences. Why? The development is only increasing. This is not going to stay the same. As a matter of fact, as far as I'm concerned, even though AI is so heavily incorporated into our lives, I still see AI as being in its infancy. So I think that's a good point, especially when you factor in the listening of human oversight. Because you know the day is coming, when human beings will say, hey, these guys can do it all. Go ahead. Handle the AI. The last one is the most, I don't know what to say. It's actually the most frightening one. They talk about number 15, A.G.I. Had never heard of A.G.I. I already said I'm not a tech person, but I do really like technology. You know what A.G.I. is? It's artificial general intelligence. Yeah. There's AI artificial intelligence, but there's going to be because it actually doesn't exist right now, but it's called artificial general intelligence. And it would be who you really look it up, just read about it. Do not say to yourself, well, you just said it doesn't exist. What do I care? Care, please, because it's coming. This artificial general intelligence, and by the way, if you don't know, like I didn't, anything about it, go online and look at Z.A.S. and Z.A.B., Z.A.S. and Deborah Net, Z.A. net, and they have a great article in this title. What is artificial general intelligence in is written by Nick Heath? And it's not a new article, by the way, it's from 2018. But it really does give you a lot of information. It'll help you clearly understand it. It's not a long read, but it's chalked full of great information. One of the things that came out in that article is this guy, Ray Kerswil, he's a futurist, Google's director of engineering, just known for his predictions as a relates to technology. And this guy says that by 2029, AGI will be here. It will be here, and it will be able to take and pass the touring test. I did not know what the touring test was. So of course, I went and looked it up, read about it. And it's essentially started back in 1950, this guy touring. The touring test is a test for intelligence in a machine. You take a machine and a human being. And both are given questions. You have another person then read the answers. The person that's reading the answers really should be unable to distinguish between those answers from the person and those from the machine. Today, they have to program it. They have to give it its task and they execute them well for the most part. This ain't that. This artificial general intelligence, it will learn on its own. It'll be taught to learn, but rapidly, I mean, super rapidly. It'll learn on its own. And what not just this curse will, but several other people say, yeah, it's not here. But it's coming and when it gets here, it'll be able to have instant recall of anything at any point in humanity's existence. It'll be able to do calculations in split seconds throughout your 2000 digit equation. Split second, it'll give you the answer. But not just that. It'll be able to not only do what humans can do, not just the physical part, but the reasoning and the logic. It'll think better than human beings faster. And when you factor in these other things like logic and reason, this guy, Curse will, he said, AGI will have more information than all of humanity over like a billion years, just like that. You don't want to fool with that. I'm telling you, I don't want to fool with it. You can speak for yourself. I don't want anything like that because you know what happens at that point. A couple of things actually happen. And human beings, we really won't be of any use then. And oh, man, I was reading so many good things. What happens with me when I find something that interests me? This is what hurts me too. I just go down and rabbit hole. I can't stop myself. I can't. But in reading about AGI, those who are saying, this is part of the reason why there's become an increasing discussion about universal basic income. Now, I don't know if that's true or not. But it makes perfectly good sense. If you don't know what universal basic income essentially, it's the government saying here, we're just going to pay you whether you can work, whether you can't work, there's several trial programs right now, right now across the country. Chicago has won San Francisco several places. They've been doing this in Europe in certain European places for a while. Remember when they're in presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, he would always talk about in Norway, in Norway. Yeah, they have it too. But that would absolutely be necessary if we get to a point where artificial general intelligence is doing everything. And doing it far, far, far better than we ever could. And you know, I greedy some of these companies can be. They'll say what the heck with human beings look at my productivity. And I mean, not one of those stinking human beings, this baby can do it all. The other thing, this would bloom me away. It's something that a curse will he mentioned this to, going forward with artificial general intelligence. And I think he's a proponent of this as well. But there's something that they call the singularity, the singularity. Remember that I didn't know it by that name. But there's this guy, his name is Martin Rothblatt. And I read about him about four years ago. He's a very smart man. He's a PhD, he has a JD, he's the creator of XM radio. He has a bunch of patterns on different things. This guy is really a smart guy. He is such a huge proponent of what I just learned is called the singularity. But it is the blending of human beings and technology. In fact, I believe that Martin Rothblatt, I think I remember him saying he doesn't even really want us to have human bodies, just the technology. So that's not really a human being. I'm thinking maybe he thinks the human spirit can be captured in this technology. And then if you look on YouTube, he built this robot in the image of his wife. And this thing is a horrible prototype. But this was a few years back. But that's what he wants to see. He wants to see human beings and technology merge. So there won't be anyone that's all human and there won't be all technology. We'll just be together. It's called the singularity. And just in case you're saying, oh, okay. So you're one of those people. You just hear the wackiest thing and you just think, oh my God, it's going to happen. They don't think that that'll happen. But I do believe that artificial general intelligence will happen. Actually sold prediction that in 2036 and there's a Forbes article where a guy says that he thinks in 2036 the very first form of AGI will be available. Oh, but I'm going to go with Ray Curse will because he has had like 80% accuracy on his technology predictions over the years. That's really high, really high. So he says by 2029, it'll be here. He goes further in predicting the date for the singularity. In fact, let me read his quote. He says, I set the date for the singularity representing a profound and disruptive transformation in human capability as 2045. Now what I didn't know when I was initially researching is that Curse will has written several books on technology and the future. And a couple of those books include the age of intelligent machines and the age of spiritual machines that first book was published over 30 years ago. And just the title of that second book did not slip past me because it is very much in line to what Martin Rothblatt believes. And he really does believe that the spirit of the human being can be merged with technology. And again, look him up and you don't be surprised when you see him. Now he identifies as a woman, but he's still a smart guy. I think he's way out there on the technology front. A couple of thoughts though. Sometime ago I interviewed a woman by the name of Catherine Albrecht. And this woman was so far ahead of the curve. I mean, so far ahead of the curve on technology, particularly AI technology. She wasn't calling it AI. She was just calling it technology. But she wasn't far off. I don't think because and I'm dating myself. I realized this. But she was talking about things like smart appliances and that one day, your refrigerator, it will keep all of your data. And maybe we don't have a refrigerator that that's this smart. But I think she was right. I think it's coming. She said, we'll have refrigerators that know when we're out of milk. Know when we're running low on ice cream. And it'll place the order for us. And I think those do kind of exist. But she took it a step further. And she said that the dangers lie in what happens if you are a diabetic or you are obese. And not even necessarily morbidly obese, but you're overweight. Your fat. What happens if that refrigerator can send your data to your insurance company? What happens? Then your insurance company says, uh huh. You're going to cost us more money fat. So we're going to raise your premiums. Oh, diabetic. Bringing ice cream into your home? Mm-hmm. We'll see about that. Increase for you too. Or what about someone that that smokes? You can think of myriad things that all of this smart technology within your home, ultimately if someone so thinks that the time has come, because start reporting data to companies, to the government. And I'm not being a wild eye, tin foil hat, where are either? I think we're right on the brink of this. But another example I'll never forget she gave. She said one day, we'll drive in cars that will have so much technology that it'll communicate. Now, this is going to sound crazy, but it'll communicate with the road about your activities, about your whereabouts, about how far you win, about where you exited the expressway, what ramp you got off. And she used a great example. She says, so imagine this. This guy who is getting a divorce or he's cheating on his wife, maybe, not getting a divorce. She said, cheating on his wife. He comes home late and the wife has had her suspicions, but there's this technology in his vehicle. And she's able to through her lawyer, a subpoena's in some way, and gets that data from his car and that data shows that these nights he exited at this exit on the expressway, which was two miles from his girlfriend's house and builds a case that way. I mean, it's just fascinating. All of this is fascinating to me. I guess this is artificial intelligence. I'm not quite certain, but she was huge on RFID. Let's make no mistake about it. The efficacy identification, or if ID, it's so important in logistics and supply chain and all of that stuff. And that's fine. However, as we watch the increased development of RFID, which has been around for what? I don't know, 40, 50 years. This interesting, though, that today RFID can work alongside artificial intelligence, and there are increased benefits from that. But with that comes increased risk for privacy. No question about it. And she did a big thing in Chicago at McCormick Place where they had this big convention there. The point was how many products contain those chips that RFID. So it doesn't mean become paranoid. Not at all. I wouldn't recommend that for anyone. I'm not. But it gives you full-for-thought to be mindful and to be watchful and to just understand the evolution and the revolution of technology and consider the impact that ultimately it will have on all of us. I stand before you to announce the first true artificial intelligence. Chronos. Tonight. We enter a new age. You know what Chronos is capable of. People who are saving Earth from self-destruction. A century ago, they were activated. Super Machines program to eradicate a plague that was destroying our planet. Us. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are. We are.
