 Hello and welcome to another podcast from Odell Technology. Today we're very fortunate to be joined by the co-founder and CEO of Upfront Diagnostics. Good morning, O'Donnellus. Morning, Stephen. Thank you so much for having me at your podcast. Odell, I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about your background and how you ended up where you are today. So yeah, we started in 2017. My brother was living in Cambridge. He was developing point-of-care devices for one of the main manufacturers of lateral flow in the UK. And I was actually studying marketing at the university in Spain. And then yeah, my brother had the idea of, you know, he wanted to create a company in diagnostics. And we found that there were no any stroke black tests in the market. So we thought that it was a great market opportunity, although it was a massive challenge. But we decided to move to Cambridge and we started up from diagnostics. And then we met the third co-founder, Dr. Eduardo Gauden, who is a PhD from the university. So that's how we all started. But basically we had this idea of starting the company. We were in the climbing world in Cambridge and that's how we met Eduardo and that's how the company started six years ago. Okay, perfect. Now tell me, what does the diagnostic do? So the problem with a stroke is that there are many different types. And each type of a stroke needs to be treated at a specialized centre. So for example, in England, there are only 24 hospitals that can deliver the specific neurosurgical procedure for a type of stroke known as large vessel occlusion, which represents around a third of all strokes, but they contribute to over 95% of these abilities and deaths. So what we develop is a rapid test, very, very similar to the COVID test. It takes a few minutes and paramedics just bring this test with them and it helps them to identify those large vessel occlusions on the spot and then redirect those patients to those specialized centres without having to go to a hospital without the specific treatment. And this saves around 100 minutes to treatment, which is the difference between life and death. So it's personalized medicine, really, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, correct. It's what they call precision medicine. And you're also your streamlined and care pathways, you're introducing cost efficiencies. Tell me, have you got good case studies of the system so far? Yeah, so we've done different studies. Here in the UK, we did a very large clinical trial in collaboration with Newcastle University under an Innovate UK grant. We tested more than 300 patients, and we achieved very, very positive results. Then we replicated the results in the US. We did a study in collaboration with the hospital in Florida, and we are publishing the results now in a few weeks. So that's quite exciting. And currently we are testing the device in five hospitals in the UK. So we are testing the device in the northeast of England in Newcastle, Northumbria, and then we are also testing the device in London. So there are actually emergency departments today testing and using the device. That's fantastic. Is it better that a paramedic has the test or is it better that an emergency department has the test? It can be both, but usually it's paramedics, since that's where you can save more time to treatment. So it's all about how long it takes to the patient to ride to the right centre. So there is value for the test to be in the emergency department, but the sooner you spot the stroke, even at the home of the patient, the sooner the patient will get to the specialised centre. So it can be used in different stages of the stroke. Absolutely. Now the company is based in Cambridge in the UK, correct? Yeah, we are in the biomedical campus in Cambridge, very close to big companies like AstraZeneca or Upcom. We know it will. I think that what you've been able to achieve in a very short space of time is remarkable. The test itself is a point of care test, so it can be done in any setting. How long does the test take to perform? Thank you, Stephen, for that question. So right now the results we have is between 10 and 15 minutes, and that's the time to diagnose it. It can be lower sometimes, but then 15 minutes is the maximum. That's fantastic. I mean, that's going to save somebody's life. And then of course you've got different ways of treating different strokes, and that's the pathway you're talking about. I wasn't aware of 24 hospitals in the UK. That's fascinating. I don't think many people would be aware of that. In Cambridge, for example, in all East Anglia, we only have Adam Brooks, Cambridge, who can treat LBO patients. In London, we have a few more hospitals, but then the more you go up, the less specialized centers that you have. So in places like Wales, Scotland, there are actually many patients from Wales and Scotland that are transferred to England for receiving treatment. And the same problem happened in the US. So in the US, only 3% of hospitals can give this specialized treatment. It's because, I mean, there are not many specialized doctors that can deliver this type of treatment. And also you need to have very specialized equipment, so it's not widely spread. And the other problem is that there are no plans to increase the amount of those centers. So there is no plans from the NHS to increase the amount of centers that will deliver this treatment. So the only way to improve the care is just to have earlier diagnosis. That's the only way. Okay. Now, the company's received some funding over the last several years. Can you tell me something about the funding? Yeah, so in total, we've received around three and a half million pounds. So we have secured a very large UK grant a few years ago. And then last year, the NHS and the Stroke Association and SBRI provided us with a 1.1 million contract to implement this technology in the NHS. And also we have institutional investors, venture capital, mainly the University of Cambridge and Apex Ventures, which is a very well known VC in Bayesian Austria that works in METEC. Yes. Okay, Apex Ventures is quite an interesting company. All right. Now, is there something you'd like to talk about in particular? So I think that, you know, a bit of how we got here, no? I think that for us, it was very important to involve clinicians from the beginning. So you think that, you know, healthcare startups needs to work with professional clinicians from the beginning. And that was part of our journey. So before we start any development and any research, we started working with the team in Newcastle University. And we actually asked them, no lie, what do you want? Which type of tool will help you to give a better care to patients? And they told us that, you know, we're starting to have this problem with stroke patients. So it will be fantastic to have a tool that could actually tell us in the ambulance, okay, what type of stroke is the patient suffering? So I think something that we learned from experience is that talking to doctors doesn't cost money. You don't need to raise any investment to do that. And I think that's a very important part because when you start development, you cannot go backwards. So when you start, you know, to do trials and to develop a device, you need to know what you're doing. So I think the sooner you start talking to professional clinicians, doctors, nurses, paramedics, patients, the less chances of doing something wrong you will have. So involve the, let's say, and this applies to any industry, you know, involve your customers since they won. And this doesn't cost any money. So you don't need to raise millions to do that. You just need to spend the time and also be open to be challenged. I think that you need to have an open mind and don't try to have all the answers, but try to ask the right questions. I think that's super important. So what challenges have you encountered in the last several years while you're doing, while you're setting up this business? It's hard to mention all of them. I would say that in the first one is finding the market fit. So there are many different types of tests that you could develop. So really finding the one that was actually going to make a difference was hard because the ones that were very clear that will make a difference were already developed. And then the ones that were so novel, the clients or the customer will not understand them. So you really need to pick something that was, you know, very novel, but at the same time, no one was doing it. I was going to be accepted by the market. And then the second, I think, is fundraising, especially during COVID. There was a moment during COVID where we were in a really bad situation because there was no capital available for us. Although there was capital, no, there was definitely people raising money, but in our case, we were stuck at our homes. We were doing our clinical trials so we didn't have any data yet. And there was a moment where it was very hard to manage our cash flow. So those two things were the most difficult, I think, like market fit and fundraising. But if you look at data, that's the main two challenges that every startup has. And those are the main two causes of companies to disappear. Like market fit fundraising is always the, no, there are other problems, but yeah. Okay, can you tell me something about the diagnostic accuracy or the diagnostic precision, sensitivity, specificity of the test? Yeah, absolutely. So we have published data in the, like public journals, so the data is publicly available. And, you know, we can share the details afterwards for people to go and look at them. But the data we've achieved is a 95% accuracy for identification of large basal occlusions with 86% sensitivity, 98% specificity. So we are very good at finding the patient that actually have an LVO. So when you transfer a patient to one of those specialized centers, you want to be almost sure that you have an LVO, because, you know, it's not only the patient who is moving to a different hospital, it's also the family of the patient. So they need to do a longer travel. And, you know, like there are many factors that will affect their lives. So you need to be very careful when you make those type of decisions. Okay, absolutely. Tell me, have you looked at the cost efficiency of this sort of an exercise, the health economic? So the, we've done an exercise, actually NHS has done an exercise for us, and we could save 440,000 pounds for every 1000 patients that received the test. So there is a huge cost savings. There are 150,000 new strokes every year. So if you multiply, you know, the costs are around 70 to 80 million per year, which is massive. If you look at the cost savings in US, Europe, we could save around 11 billion pounds per year due to, you know, the net cost of reducing ambulance transfers that are not needed, unnecessary CT scans, unnecessary clinicians, nurses involved in the process, but also on the net cost, you know, the cost of a patient being disabled for the rest of their lives is massive, you know, for insurance companies, for the healthcare system, for the country, you know, because it's people that maybe they are working and now they cannot work anymore. And also you need to help them to continue with their life. So obviously there is a massive direct cost saving that but also indirect. No, absolutely. I think it has a enormous budget impact effect on a lot of operations, particularly integrated care systems. Is there anything else you'd like to mention? So I think that, you know, like talking about venture capital in Medtech, which I think is different from other markets, you know, like in other industries, especially like software, generating revenues at least is doable. While in our world, let's call it our bubble, started to generate revenues, it takes a lot of time, because you need to go through a very lengthy process. So there are ways of showing traction to those investors that you will make it, but until you start generating revenues is a high risk for them. The problem that they have venture capital, I think in this space is that if they don't, if they invest too early, they are taking a lot of risks, and maybe they lose their money. But if they wait too long, then those companies start generating revenues, they can start, you know, having deals with the strategic companies like, you know, the rush, the adults, the big companies, and that actually puts them out of the scope. So it's very hard for venture capital in Medtech to make the right decisions because they need to balance the risks with missing an opportunity. So I think it's a very different world from, I think it happens also in life science, not therapeutics, but there is definitely a challenge for venture capital in Medtech because there are too, there are, we're just too many, and it's hard to pick the right ones. But if you arrive too late, then you don't have an opportunity to get a piece of the cake. So I think that there is a challenge in venture capital in Medtech that I think with, you know, like all the, you know, University of Cambridge, incubators, all these signs, all these things that are creating traction is reducing the risks for them. But anyway, I think it's a, it's a different type of investment. Yeah, I think that for us, the challenge is how to prove that we are going to be the one making it. Although there are, you know, there are things that you can collect and you can show that that that will happen to say, okay, I think the, you know, upfront, I think is the right one. Absolutely. So have you started generating revenue at this point in time? So we have secure contracts with the NHS. It's non-recurrent revenue, so it's just a one-off payment. But we will start generating revenues very soon. So we will start compensating probably early next year. So yeah, we are, we are, we're very close to get the approvals and start revenues. So yeah, we are getting there. And where was the kid manufactured? She's manufactured in England. We are collaborating with a third party, and they have a manufacturer inside with 90 employees. So yeah. Okay, very well done. I've enjoyed talking to you today, and I hope to talk to you again in another six months time. You're making a big difference.
