 Since the dawn of civilization, spies of every nation and culture have worked to infiltrate their adversaries and glean the information that will give their side the advantage. The stakes are sky high, the strategy is varied and imaginative, and the ultimate sign of success is that no one ever even knew you were there. In each episode, we will explore the moral and ethical gray zones of espionage, where treachery and betrayal go hand in hand with cunning and courage. This is the Spycraft 101 podcast. Welcome to your clandestine classroom. This is episode number 160 of the Spycraft 101 podcast. Joining me today is Zach Dorfman. Zach is a national security reporter whose work has appeared in Politico, The Atlantic, The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times, and many other publications. He received his bachelor's degree from Skidmore College and a master's degree in international relations and affairs from the University of Chicago. Zach is a former senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs. He's also the host of the Spy Valley podcast from Project Brazen, which debuted last year about a Cold War-era spy in the heart of Silicon Valley. I invited Zach onto the podcast to discuss his newest article, published on August 4th of this year titled, Moscow Spies Were Stealing U.S. Tech Until the FBI Started a Sabotage Campaign. It's the story of Operation Entering, a highly successful and never-before-reported operation against Soviet block intelligence operatives targeting U.S. technology in the early 1980s.

Justin, thank you so much for having me. Of course, of course. I loved hearing your work on the Spy Valley podcast last year, but at the time, I didn't expect that I'd actually be speaking to you myself one day, but here we are. First of all, I'm really glad that you mentioned the Spy Valley podcast, which was a blast to report and write and host, and I'm thrilled to be here. Fantastic. So this operation entering, I don't want to get too much into Spy Valley because you've done such a great job of covering it, but I strongly encourage everybody to go and listen to that series after you've heard this episode if you haven't heard it already, although I've certainly mentioned it a few times myself on Instagram and elsewhere. So with operation entering, this article just debuted a few days ago and it was brand new to me and apparently it was brand new to everyone. So how did you first learn about this story enough to start digging into it for your own work? Well, I'm based in San Francisco and I'm kind of an odd duck because I'm a national security reporter who is based on the West Coast and for, I think, obvious reasons and mostly good reasons. The vast majority, pretty much all national security reporting is centered in the Washington, DC area. And when I started doing national security reporting as such from the West Coast, not looking at Silicon Valley from the perspective of tech companies or Silicon Valley from the perspective of business or culture, I mean, there's a lot of good reporting that goes on in that vein and there's a lot of great reporters who do that sort of journalism. But I wanted to take Silicon Valley and the West Coast seriously on its own terms as a place where important things in national security and intelligence and counterintelligence were occurring. And so years ago, when I started kind of going down this road, this career path, I began reaching out to folks who had spent years, sometimes decades, of working on intelligence and counterintelligence issues on the West Coast and Silicon Valley in particular. And along the way, I managed to meet and get to know quite well some FBI counterintelligence agents who spent, like I said, decades enmeshed in this stuff, who were real experts and had I think distinct and important perspective on counterintelligence issues because they had focused on it from the West Coast. And some of those folks were active throughout the later decades of the Cold War, which was a hugely important time in counterintelligence issues in Silicon Valley. And one of those FBI agents, those retired FBI agents, whose name is Rick Smith, who worked Soviet and Russian counterintelligence from the early 70s through the mid 90s in San Francisco, which is, by the way, as an aside, is very unusual for FBI agents to work counterintelligence in one place for their entire careers, highly unusual. There was a core or a cadre of folks who moved out to San Francisco, many of them from the East Coast in the early to mid 70s and stayed together as a group for decades, which created this really interesting espri decor. And they also developed a reputation as some of the best counterintelligence personnel that the Bureau had nationally. Like DC was always, that's the heart center of everything. New York obviously had a lot going on, but San Francisco was always considered kind of cream of the crop when it came to FBI counterintelligence, folks. It's just important to kind of set that context, kind of the culture that was there at the time within the Bureau, and this almost kind of like band of brothers attitude that you had. And so having known Rick for years, we've had coffee on and off, and he was, you know, he was willing to lean in and share a story that originated through some of his hard work, running a very important counterintelligence campaign out of San Francisco, which is called Operation Entering. And that's the genesis of my introduction to the story and to the world of, you know, Rick and some of his FBI compatriots. Fantastic that you built that level of trust with those guys who are, it sounds like they were very like a closed circle, almost, I guess, but then you were able to get to know them well enough and get them to open up about something as fascinating as this. So after Rick, after you learned about this, was it difficult to develop the complete story? Because, you know, you're only getting one perspective initially just from the FBI, the eyesight, I take it. Well, I'm a reporter. I don't think I ever get the complete story, especially as an intelligence reporter. I don't ever believe that I have the complete story. I don't even know if there is such a thing as a complete story. I mean, I think not to wax too philosophical about it, but I just think that there's always, you know, there's a reason why they call it the wilderness of mirrors. There's always gray areas. Certainly with this story, I felt like I had a very good understanding from the bureau's perspective. I would have loved to have had the understanding from the Soviet block side, right, being able to potentially look at some of the Soviet block archives related to this operation and how they viewed it would have been fascinating. And then, of course, the main source that Rick and the FBI used, the FBI agents whom I spoke, including Rick, were not, you know, they were not willing to share this person's name with me. And I was unable to independently identify this person. So, of course, I would like, in theory, that person's perspective as well. But all in all, I was very happy with the level of detail I was able to provide because it's, you know, honestly, it was unusual for me and I think in general. So the whole story, no, certainly not. But a level of granularity that I thought was really good and important as a historical example, absolutely. Zach, you're definitely preaching to the choir on that part. I can't count the number of times here on the podcast. I've said something along the lines of we'll probably never know the rest of the story, unfortunately. So I definitely picked the wrong niche to get into as an amateur historian trying to really find out what actually happened at the bottom of things. Unfortunate. But yeah, absolutely endlessly fascinating topic. And I do really enjoy that little air of mystery that's in your article about the identity of the central figure of the article. But it's, you know, as you read through it, of course, it's very understandable why they would not have revealed that information, why that person would not have gone public themselves, as we'll get into, certainly. So we mentioned, of course, it's called Operation Entering. So what exactly was it? What were the goals of Operation Entering? So Operation Entering was an FBI offensive counterintelligence operation that ran from the very early 1980s to about 1983. So pretty significant amount of time. And the objective was to have somebody who was under FBI control and FBI assets pretend to be a crooked businessman from Silicon Valley, willing to sell the Soviet block technology that was dual use and export prohibited. Dual use just means that it has both civilian and military or intelligence related uses. Right. And there was a whole host of technologies then as now that are prohibited to export to Russia and the Soviet block then and Russia today. And so what the bureau did was they, you know, they said, look, we know that the Soviets and their allies are just so greedy for the cutting edge in American high tech. And at the time that was, you know, that was microchips. You're talking about the beginning of the personal computer revolution and also just the computing power revolution. Right. And so there's clear uses for that for military and intelligence purposes, whether you're talking about missile control systems, radar, space exploration, super computers, I mean, stuff that we take for granted now, but really was, was kind of the dawn of that of that age. And the FBI and the CIA knew that the Soviets and their allies were unable to indigenously produce those things at the level that was being produced and innovated in Silicon Valley and the U.S. And they also knew that the Soviet Union and its allies were engaged in a massive global effort to either surreptitiously covertly purchase those prohibited goods or to steal them when they, when they, when they needed to. And then as now, you know, the Russians were kind of like world leaders in this, right? I mean, especially after the 2022 full scale invasion of Ukraine, you know, there was another clampdown where there was more sanctions and the sanctions on the Russians. And they also once again started engaging in the same, they never really stopped, but it got much more intensive after, you know, the U.S. and its allies put the screws on Russian importation of dual use goods. So, you know, the early 1980s was a really illustrative and instructive era because not to draw too fine of a historical parallel, but although the Russians always were unable legally to import certain goods after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in late 1979, you know, then President Jimmy Carter slapped some very, very significant sanctions on them, which squeezed their ability to import high tech goods, right? So their reaction then was very similar to their reaction post-Ukraine, right? Post-Ukraine invasion as global, as global campaign. So the bureau knew this and the bureau decided to go on the offensive. And, you know, Rick and his colleagues, you know, decided, OK, what we're going to do is we're going to find somebody who's going to be willing to pretend to be this crook and to sell the Soviets and their allies technology that has been sabotaged for tamper. And there was a whole bunch of reasons why they decided to do that. But that is the, you know, that's the kind of view from 10,000 feet of the operation. It went on for years. It was very successful. They managed to get the Soviet block to purchase millions of dollars in, you know, in tampered, tampered US goods. And I'm sure there's lots of other operations of this sort that have been carried out over the years and executed. But this is a rare example, I think, of a revelation in the public sphere about, you know, how the bureau thought about this stuff and a bureau success. Absolutely. Absolutely. No doubt. So was this like a top down initiative or was this something that Rick developed himself or one of his co-workers there in San Francisco developed themselves and kind of sold from the bottom up, so to speak? So I think there was a there was increasing interest, broadly speaking, in the issue of Soviet block tech theft, what they call tech transfer in the 70s and 80s. So, you know, in the late 70s, you had these revelations around what were known as the farewell dossier, when the yeah, of course, right? You know this, but like for any listener, just like as he doesn't know about farewell, basically, there was a KGB officer who was a senior officer who worked in Moscow in the KGB's S&T, Science and Technology Division. His last name was Vetrov. He was recruited by the French. Actually, he was recruited by the French domestic services, if I remember correctly, which is really interesting. But he was recruited by the French and he provided what became known as the farewell dossier. And farewell was the code name that the French gave to him. Farewell dossier was an exhaustive list of all of the technology that the Soviets and their allies had either stolen successfully or were looking to steal, right? It was like these were shopping lists. And what they did was, this is important for entering, what the Soviets did, what the KGB did was they had a list of stuff that they themselves were like, we're going to steal this stuff. And then they also handed out shopping lists to all the different allied Soviet block services, right? Entering focused on the East Germans and the Bulgarians, but you also have checks, you know, the Poles, the Hungarians. So there was an understanding by the early 1980s of the extent of this problem, right? Like that's the world in which Rick Smith was operating, where like the CIA and of course the French then French intelligence passed the farewell dossier on to the CIA. So the FBI knew the extent of the issue. But this was a case where this was really Rick's initiative, right? This was Rick's initiative saying, you know what, there's this guy, you know, I met him. I met him a year before. Rick, this all came together in a bar in San Francisco, right? I mean, Rick knew who this guy was because he was a, you know, he was a entrepreneur. He was a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. He was Austrian by nationality. They knew he had tried to like legally, I went on our line legally, drum up business with the Soviets. So, you know, the bureau would routinely obviously surveil the Soviet consulate in San Francisco. They realized that this guy was going out of the consulate. They determined that his, you know, his business objectives were completely above board. They approached him. They said, maybe you can work with us. It didn't really work. Nothing really worked out. That's fine. Stuff like that happens. And Rick forgot all about him. And then about a year later, he runs into this guy at a bar just randomly. And it's a great bar, by the way. It's called the Galboa Cafe. It still exists. If anybody is ever in San Francisco, it's worth a trip out to the Calhalla neighborhood. It's a beautiful, historic bar. And Rick sees this guy in the bar and strikes up a conversation and starts thinking himself, you know what, this guy has the perfect background for being recruited by the FBI, working with us, you know, and then pretending to be a crook, right? And that was how Interim All came together. It was really Rick's initiative and the initiative of other folks in the FBI office in San Francisco, including Rick's co-lead on the case, who was an extraordinary FBI agent by the name of Bill Canane, who passed away very suddenly a few years ago, but was another lifelong FBI counterintelligence agent in San Francisco. I talk about Bill for hours. Bill was like, Bill was an amazing guy who did extraordinary work for decades at the FBI office in San Francisco, all exclusively counterintelligence work. So Rick and Bill co-ran this case from San Francisco. So, yeah, I mean, this really was an example of the kind of like initiative and, you know, daring do of the FBI folks in San Francisco. Hmm. Yeah, it sounds like it. And from that, I guess you would say, surprising beginning, it spun up into something clearly enormous. And what do you think that Rick anticipated or wanted that at all at the time that he see this as the start of something huge? Or was this just an opportunity that might be worth, you know, exploring? Wanted it, I'm sure. I mean, I mean, if you're an FBI counterintelligence agent and your target is the Soviets and the Soviet bloc and you have a guy who you've convinced the Soviet bloc intelligence services is willing to sell you, you know, millions of dollars in cutting-edge high tech, but you're actually just running a pretty kick-ass up against them. I mean, I'm sure he was thrilled at the time. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, beyond that, I think, I don't think it ever got too big. I mean, I think it was, I think, you know, when you talk to Rick about it, I think it was a really complex operation. I mean, I think that's something that really impressed me about what he and his colleagues did, which was that running something like this, there's a ton of balls in the air at once, because you're talking about companies and parts and transshipment places and how do you how do you alter or sabotage certain kinds of technology in the way that you want to, but also not in a way that makes it look too obvious and, you know, getting buy-in from all of these different countries that you're working through and where is this technology going to end up and all the ethical issues surrounding, you know, the potential uses of the technology and the trade-offs of like, well, we can't have it all be sabotaged. And so how much do you let through that's unadulterated? I mean, there was a ton of stuff that these folks were thinking about at the time. And, you know, it's amazing to me that they were able to run it for as long as they did. And then, of course, there's the concerns about the health and safety of the source that you're using as well. So that was a big part of it, too. So I think, you know, I don't know if I really answered your question well, but just one thing that I walked away from and pressed by was the complexity of the operation and the ability to pull something like that off. Yeah, I totally agree. And it seems extremely difficult to manage. And it's so easy to see so many ways it could have gone terribly wrong. I mean, their, you know, their risk assessment and their risk mitigation had to be very carefully thought out because you talk about they have to give some functional dual use technology to their greatest adversary of the time as part of a larger operation. Like somebody has to sign off on that. Somebody has to, you know, explain clearly why this is ultimately of benefit to the United States and to the detriment of our adversary, that sort of thing. So it's I think it's a real testament to Rick that so much of this was actually cleared, I would imagine, and that it actually went through that he was able to kind of sell this idea and get, you know, buy in from so many different levels and so many different organizations that had to be involved. Yeah, you know, and I should I should also mention, you know, I spoke to somebody else for the story who was also an extraordinary, you know, FBI counterintelligence agent. Also, you know, he's retired, retired for a long time, a long time. He's retired for a long time. His name is Ed Appel. And Ed kind of oversaw the case from DC. Ed was running the East German and Bulgarian desk at FBI headquarters. Ed has also had a really extraordinary career in FBI counterintelligence. And so he, you know, it's interesting because Ed's perspective on this on this operation was a little different because he was he was catching the brunt of the heat from DC about it. You know, Rick was like running the operation. He was he was out there in San Francisco overseeing. He was flying around. But the bureaucratic issues that arose, I think Ed really felt those more tangibly. And just to give a couple of examples, there was an interagency process that had to govern all of this. There were, you know, so-called equities, right at play, right? So the Pentagon, you know, according to Ed, really did not like this operation. They, you know, they really he had to fight tooth and nail to keep this operation going because the Pentagon was like, wait, what? I mean, pretty much exactly what you said. The Pentagon was like, so you're telling me that a good chunk of this stuff that could in theory, you know, assist Soviet military capabilities, you're just going to let that go. You're going to let you're going to let that stuff go through. Before we go on, I want to tell you all about a new podcast from Tenderfoot TV called To Die For. Imagine you were a fly on the wall at a dinner between the Mafia, the CIA, and the KGB. That's where this unprecedented podcast begins. Brought to you by the makers of the hit podcast To Live and Die in LA. To Die For marks the first time a Russian trained honey trap has told her story from beginning to end. Taught to seduce men for their secrets and sometimes their lives. Alia Rosa was trained to believe that her body no longer belonged to her. It belonged to the state. She was meticulously trained to be the perfect weapon, able to seduce her targets into compromising situations that have ended careers and sometimes lives. From Tenderfoot TV, the studio that brought you up and vanished and to live and die in LA. Make sure you check out To Die For, available beginning on March 26th, wherever you get your podcast. And of course the bureau said, yeah, we have to do that. We have to, you know, for the ruse to be viable, a certain percentage of it has to work correctly. And the Pentagon apparently at the time did not like that. There was the Pentagon, you know, there was commerce was involved. The DOJ and the Attorney General was involved because of course you need to create a waiver where you're saying, look, we know this guy is breaking this source. The Austrian, this guy is breaking a lot of laws and we need to allow him to keep breaking American laws because he's doing it on behalf of the US government. So that was a really interesting part of it too. And also it just, you know, I think a thing that I don't think your listeners need to be reminded of, but I think it's always, it's important to underline it about the kind of cliche or caricature of the US intelligence community and then the reality of it. This is a case where there were like many different layers of bureaucracy, like kind of checking what was going on with kind of contending interests and making sure that there was like, you had legal reviews from the DOJ side and you had assessments of potential damage on the Pentagon side. And then the Bureau had multiple layers, right? And like, so there was, there was a lot of very high level interagency debate and discussion over this. And, you know, to be honest, I mean, frankly, like I found that reassuring because, because I was like, good, I mean, this is really sensitive and you don't want to have something like this happen where it's just like one FBI agent in San Francisco who's just doing this, right? So this, so you had multiple layers of review and these contending perspectives that kind of allowed them to continue for as long as they could, but I'm sure also constrained them in certain ways. Sure, I can, I can certainly see that. Was the, this operation was a success by pretty much any measure, but was the overarching goal to, I mean, I can see several potentials here, but was it to get them to waste their limited funds on stuff that didn't work? Was it to identify the, you know, supply chains and the personnel involved in getting restricted items over to Soviet Union or something else or a combination of everything? I mean, it was all those things. So look, I mean, let's go through it one by one, because I think this is, I think this is like important to understand why these operations are run and that the multiple advantages that they can, you know, accrue. So as you said, one way this does it is it helps you map out illegal importation networks and intelligence officers and their assets that are involved in tech transfer and tech theft, right? So that's advantage number one. Now, what's interesting too, as kind of an addendum to this story is that there were a couple cases after Operation Intering ended, a couple cases where there were some prosecutions out of Southern California where they traced these networks and realized, okay, you know what, we actually have people who are on the US side, whose names have appeared as part of like this network analysis that we've been able to do based on entering and we're going to prosecute them, right? And another thing that I would love to have known about this story, but I just don't, is, you know, what intelligence may have been passed from the Bureau and the CIA to partners abroad and allies abroad about like, hey, guess what? You have a network problem here, you know, you have an issue in Austria or in the Netherlands or in Switzerland, right? So there's, there's that stuff too. So that's, that's one part of it. The other part of it is like, as you mentioned, you can start to map out a picture of what your adversary wants and needs and doesn't have and why they might want it, right? And that is a way of gathering intelligence, which might be a little counterintuitive, but can be very, very valuable, right? Because you don't know what necessarily all of the intelligence requirements on the S&T side are for your adversaries until you're figuring out precisely what they're asking for. So that's another really, that's another big advantage of it. I mean, the third advantage, which you also mentioned is that, you know, especially in those days, but today as well, hard currency is valuable, right? You're just draining your adversaries coffers, right? You're just, you're forcing them to spend US dollars in the many millions, right? When like that, that also imposes a cost on them. And then, of course, you are theoretically arresting or retarding their S&T research and development. And I want to just, I want to underline something here, which is the Soviet bloc in entering wasn't just asking for microchips. They were also asking for a highly specialized computer production equipment and technology, right? They wanted to steal the tech, reverse engineer the tech, build factories that would then allow them to replicate the tech, right? Because that's a lot easier. There's a certain point, you don't want to just like steal microchips by the hundreds, right? You want to steal the design, kind of like what the Chinese do today. And then you want to build a factory that produces it. And that's what they were trying to do. I mean, so some of the technology that was sabotaged were these highly specialized computer production tools. There is some evidence that I was able to piece together about the successes of this, right? Because the main East Bloc agency that the FBI reeled in were the Bulgarians. And I found some evidence from a Bulgarian academic who goes back through, you know, his country's Cold War archives. And around the exact same time that entering was going on, there was a secret agreement between the KGB and the Bulgarian intelligence services, where the KGB basically told the Bulgarians, you need to get us this computer production equipment. Once you get that equipment for us, we're going to build computer production factories in Russia, in Russia proper. And we're going to indigenously produce this stuff. Now, according to the academic research that I found, they did in fact put this factory together, but it was beset by a lot of delays. Now, maybe that was because of entering, maybe that was because of other things. And by the time the factory actually got up and running, the technology that they were supposed to produce was completely absolute. Now, so look, I don't know for 100% fact that that was because of entering, but this is like, this is just another data point that strongly suggests the overall success of that operation. Sure. Sure. Just endless frustrations for the other side. So do you happen to know like what percentage, just as an example of functional stuff had to be sent over? I mean, I'm imagining after a couple of shipments where practically everything is garbage that they start to get suspicious or at the very least frustrated pretty quickly. So I don't know the exact percentage, but I do know that, again, I don't know the percentages this either, but a percentage of the tech was not sabotaged. It was shipped clean. A percentage of it was sabotaged in a way to make it appear like it was kind of normal wear and tear, you know, like you get an Amazon package and you're like, hey, what the hell? You know, right. And some of it was like made to look like there was a problem with the shipment. Like, oh, we're like literally just like the Bureau replaced it with sandbags. You know, like, oh, it looks like something something got messed up in the in the intermediary steps, right? Because you had in order to in order to keep the ultimate end user a recipient of these these shipments hidden what the Soviet block did then. And of course, you know, the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, etc. Do today is like, you know, you create all these different trans shippers all over the world to to hide the ultimate the ultimate recipient. So sometimes the stuff just didn't get there. And then sometimes the stuff was altered in a way that was imperceptible, right? And I suspect strongly that was probably in the shipments that dealt with production, like production tools themselves, right? Where, you know, these are testing tools to make sure that, you know, the chips are working correctly or everything is calibrated perfectly and finally. And you create some, you know, you do something that alters the thing that is that calibrates it to a certain extent. So even an expert in a factory in Russia or elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc might not might not see or understand that something has been subtly altered, right? And that's really, I mean, that's the way you keep an operation going and then subtly and subtly and systematically degrade the production capabilities of an adversary, right? If you think about it, I mean, that is an amazing way over time to degrade an adversary. And so I think that was also in the mix. Yeah, very, very clever. And so that brings up a great point. Was that the FBI agents themselves manipulating this technology? Or did they have to bring in the producers themselves and, you know, buy sabotage equipment or hire contractors or something? I mean, how did that work exactly? So yeah, I mean, there's some, there's some, there's some muddiness there for me. And one thing that isn't muddy, I'll say is that, you know, the companies themselves had no idea. They were not, they were not winning parties to any of this. And that introduces some interesting ethical questions as well. But I think this is all done because basically what happened was you had these American companies like Cule Packard, for instance, was one of them. And they sold stuff to American distributors. And then X number of steps later, it would find its way to the Eastern Bloc, right? So they had no idea because they were never selling. You know, these American producers were never selling directly to the Eastern Bloc. They had no direct role in the scheme. They had no knowledge of the scheme. OK, you know, the second part of your question, it's a really interesting one. There were specialized US government technicians that were brought in to help sabotage this high tech. I don't know if they were FBI. I think they came from multiple agencies. Some of that work was done in London as part of entering, but I don't I don't know precisely who did it. I mean, I know that, you know, it's not like Rick himself or Bill himself, you know, Bill was doing it, right? Like these are FBI case agents, right? They don't they didn't have the technical skills or understanding to do that work, which is, you know, extraordinarily specialized. I mean, I think, you know, there are folks in NSA, for instance, who have that skill set. And CIA, who have that skill set. And, you know, I don't know for certain, but I would have if I were a betting person, I would bet that there was some involvement there. Gotcha. That makes perfect sense. But it also it also just speaks to the size and the breadth of this that you have so many organizations and only one of them has to have some sort of leak. As, of course, occurred many times to, you know, sabotage the operation. The sabotage operation could be sabotaged as well. Yeah, I mean, look, it's amazing. They kept it going as long as they kept it going. I mean, I think it was something that, you know, they recognize the value of they realized that it was very complex. They didn't want to jeopardize it while it was going on. And they kept a tight lid on it. I mean, I think, look, I don't know if this is a known, you know, not to get to Rumsfeldian, but I don't know if this is like a it's like a known unknown. I think like we don't really know, or at least I don't. We don't know how many of these operations never get into the public sphere. I mean, I think the vast majority never get into the public sphere as a reporter. I like it when things get in the public sphere. I like learning about them. I think they're really fascinating. I think some of them are, you know, I think they're illustrative and important for different reasons. But we just don't really know. I mean, you know, I spoke to other folks about, you know, there have been other sorts of these operations that have that have occurred over the years. I know that much for a fact. I mean, there's been some reporting about different operations of this sort targeting Iran and North Korea much more recently. And I could say independently that I'm aware of stuff on the Iranian side, but I'm very happy that the American system is an open one. But I also think that I think very little of this stuff actually ever gets out. Yeah, I would I would certainly imagine that to be true, which is unfortunate for reporters and amateur historians like myself. But it's the nature of the game. It is indeed. Yeah. But it certainly helps you keep your interest. So I'm curious, the middleman that you mentioned, the unidentified Austrian, did this turn into him essentially like every time he had to go meet the his contacts? Was he having to apologize for the last shipment? So to speak, like, hey, I'm sorry that half of that didn't work, but I promise we fixed the error. Anything like that was this like a and, you know, was the pressure intensifying over time for him as the front man? You know, I don't think I think at first things were really going quite smoothly. I think, you know, there was there was an expectation that some things would not. I think there was an expectation by the Bulgarians and the Russians that, you know, look, there's going to be some. There's going to be some room for error when you're when you're running a transnational sanctions evasion scheme, importing sense of technology. Right. So I think I think that for a while, they were quite happy and they got a bunch of stuff. Some of it was unadulterated and some of the stuff that was sabotaged, I think they didn't realize was sabotaged. So, you know, my understanding from Rick and others is that they were very, very pleased. I mean, they apparently even, you know, per Rick, they even had the Bulgarian intelligence officers who were running this operation were were feted with parade, apparently, or as part of a parade in the Bulgaria's capital of Sofia, where they like they actually, you know, they actually, you know, I was paraded out, they brought out some of these computer parts and like put them, you know, on the street as part of this, you know, this military parade. Right. But there was a point where they became suspicious. And I think most of their, I think, you know, this, this business person is Austrian. I think most of the meetings that they had that he had with the Soviet block operatives were a neutral terrain, right? Like Switzerland or Austria, you know, then kind of classic Cold War locales. At some point, my understanding is that I think, I think 1983 or so, they became suspicious and they asked him to meet them in Bulgaria, you know, behind the iron curtain. And, you know, the Austrian told Rick and the FBI about the request and the suspicion. And Rick and the bureau said, absolutely not. You are not going and this operation is complete because clearly they had their suspicions about you. It is not safe for you to go there. Any subsequent shipment would be scrutinized to an extent that it would be clear immediately that something was wrong. So everything went very, very well until it went very wrong. But, you know, actually, as far as things go, that's pretty good, right? Because their source never went behind the iron curtain and they decided to pull the plug. And so they had a really successful run and then they decided that, you know, time was up and the time was up. Ed Appel, the former FBI counterintelligence agent from DC, who helped run the case. I mean, he kind of waxed philosophical about it in a way that I thought was really interesting. He said, look, you know, these things all have a half life, right? Like you can't run an operation like this forever. They're really complex. You know, there's always these trade-offs. There's always worries about your sources. You know, the opposite side always, you know, has its antenna up. And so he just said, look, these things, they have to end sometime. And so there was no sense from anybody who ran the operation that, you know, the ending was premature. It just, it worked really, really, really well until it was over. OK. Yeah, it sounds like a pretty successful wrap up overall. And speaking of the Austrian, did he stay on the payroll after that so to speak? Or was that the end of his relationship with the FBI, as far as you know? That's it. As far as I know, I mean, he worked with them and he helped them out and he got paid as a source. And he got, you know, he was making money off of these transfers, too. He was a businessman. And that was part of the deal, right? It was like, you know, the FBI didn't didn't seize the profits that he made. So he made a profit working with the Soviet bloc and then he was also being paid by the bureau. And then, of course, after the operation ended, he could no longer, he could no longer engage in, you know, an economic intercourse with the Soviet bloc because it was illegal immediately, the moment that operation ended. And he was no longer being paid by the bureau. So he just went back to being a businessman who apparently ended up being a very, very successful businessman. So there was a happy ending for him there, too. Yeah, it certainly sounds like it. And I know that you mentioned in the story as well that there was some concern about him. And I don't know how well-founded it was, but the FBI, in a sense, they had kind of engineered like this perfect, well-established black marketeer, kingpin guy, and then they had to kind of cut him loose. Like, boy, I hope he doesn't use that just for himself in the future. You know, they look, they were worried about that and not just not just him doing that in the future, but then also while they were running the operation, because they're kind of just like, you know, we can't keep tabs on this guy all the time. We don't know if there are side deals or other things that he's engaged in, right? Because we're like, we literally are giving him US government cover to engage, you know, to trade with the enemy, literally. And there was always concern there, you know, I mean, I don't think it was ever founded, you know, I mean, I think it was, you know, I think, but nonetheless, right, one, human nature, two, counterintelligence professionals can be untrusting, paranoid. I mean, it's like, it's a professional benefit, right, to an extent, right? I mean, there's like a way of looking at the world. And I think that there was concern there over time. And so I think there was probably some relief on the Bureau's end to say, you know what, we wrapped this operation up in a way that, you know, it didn't kind of blow up in our faces. And, you know, there was never any evidence of this guy kind of double dealing. And so I think that was definitely a live concern as well. Yeah, certainly, especially, I don't recall the timeline exactly right now, but, you know, a lot of people know the story of Edwin P. Wilson, who from the CIA, who got very good at very similar stuff as part of his job and then kind of went out on the private market, doing it for himself to a certain extent. Didn't he do it with Libya? Didn't he start selling stuff to Libya? He did. Yeah, yeah. He went to prison for selling, I think it was like 20 tons of C4 he shipped over, but his sentence ultimately, he spent like 12 years in prison, I think, and then his sentence was overturned because his lawyer using FOIA requests proved that he had had like over 80 separate contacts with the CIA during that time. So he was not fully out of the agency, you know, to a certain extent anyway. So pretty murky story there, but he definitely realized that what he was already doing for the US government, he could also do as a private citizen and make a heck of a lot more money out of it, apparently. Yeah, I mean, that's a big danger, right? Because it's like, was he just, you know, was he just an ex CIA officer who was providing intelligence? Was he being tasked by the agency? I mean, what was the extent and depth of the relationship? Was there any, you know, was there any money? Was he a paid source? Was he, I mean, this is a really murky world. And of course, these are big issues today, too, right? Do you have a lot of ex, you know, ex CIA folks and ex IC folks who go abroad and do work abroad and still maintain some, I mean, some don't. I don't, the whole like, there's no such thing as an ex CIA officer. That's not true. But that's just, that's just not true. I mean, emphatically, that's not true. But there is contact between some and there's, you know, and I think it gets very, very murky, right? And we had cases with, you know, I think it was NSA personnel in the Gulf in particular, right? Where they're starting to, you know, work with foreign governments. And it's like, but if they're keeping some kind of connections to the USG side, I mean, it just makes, it brings up ethical issues. And certainly legal ones that, that make it very hard to prosecute individuals if they have a ongoing relationship with former employers. Definitely. Definitely. So on the subject of the Soviets and the Bulgarians, all of them, or were they all outside of the US? You mentioned the third country, neutral ground meetings and all that. I mean, was there anyone at the end of this to PNG out of the United States or anything like that? Or did they just continue on having kind of lost this battle? Nobody was PNG. As far as I understand it, the Bulgarian intelligence officers around the operation were Europe based. There were Bulgarian intelligence officers who were also indicted, but I don't think they were ever, they were never tried. But there were Bulgarian intelligence officers who were indicted in the very least in Southern California. And I don't think, I don't think there were any PNGs or arrests of foreign intelligence officers. The only folks I know who were, who, you know, were brought to justice in the legal system were, I think the folks I previously mentioned, the US side folks who were violating export control bans. But, you know, as you know, I mean, prosecution is only a really small piece of these operations, right? And sometimes it has no part of it. Sometimes literally prosecution has nothing to do with counterintelligence operations and they exist in a different zone entirely. This one, the very fact that there was any prosecution that arose at all makes it, I think, I mean, unusual. So I can't say I'm surprised, but it's fascinating that folks were charged at all. Totally agree. Yeah, this is an incredible story, Zach. And you did great work bringing it to light finally after all this time. So for those of you listening, if you want to read Zach's story, we'll link it up in the show notes when this episode comes out. It's on politico.com right now. Just look for Zach Dorfman's most recent article. Fascinating stuff, Zach. Are you already working on something new now? Like what's next on the horizon for you? I got multiple things. I'll plug. There is a story that I've been working on for years that will be out by Monday. It's like in Rolling Stone magazine. And I'm still still slightly paranoid about talking about it before it's out. But it's a story about it's a war on terror story, essentially. And it's a story about somebody within CIA who did some extraordinary things and was fetid for those extraordinary things, but then came home and had some very significant psychological or mental health issues related to the work they did. And so the story is about the work and program that this person engaged in at the agency. And then also what happened to them when they came back and whether they got the care they needed. And the larger questions surrounding the care and the state of the very specific program that this person was engaged in. So it's coming out. It should be out Sunday. So by the time people are listening to this, it should be out in Rolling Stone. And it's a story that I'm very, very proud of. It's it's not the easiest reading, admittedly. But I think that it's it's something that if I dare say it, I think it's an important story and something that I hope gets a conversation going about how we care for folks that do very, very difficult deep cover work. Wow, Zach, you certainly know how to set the hook. I will give you that. Because I'm very interested. No. Well, I look forward to that. And then and that's I think that's an incredible accomplishment. Honestly, two major major stories like this on two different subjects dropping in a two week period. That's that's impressive work. That's pure happenstance. That is pure happenstance. That is stuff that these are these stories that I have been, you know, diligently piecing together for years. And they just happened randomly to appear on back to back weekend. So it feels really, really good. But these are, you know, reporting these out as like molasses and then writing them as the same. So I'm just really happy that they're out in the world. And if you you want to talk about the Rolling Stones story or any or any other story, Justin, I'd be more than happy to come back. It's been it's been really, really fun talking to you. OK, yeah, fantastic. That's I will take you up on that definitely because this has been a great conversation. And as I was saying before we started recording, I've read a lot of your other reporting and it's certainly right up my alley, right up the listeners alley. So I would like to dive back into some of your previous work and it sounds like some of your future work as well. So I really appreciate your time. Zach, thank you so much. And I look forward to this new article and I really enjoyed what you just wrote as well. Thank you, Justin. My pleasure. Absolutely. So can you tell us where people can connect with you online if they want to kind of follow along with you? Sure. Yeah, I mean, I am, you know, I'm on Twitter and if folks want to get in touch via email, a good email for me is the brush pass one at protonmail.com. I used to run a newsletter called the brush pass, which is where that's from. So it's just the brush pass one, the number one at protonmail.com. OK, fantastic. Well, thank you so much, Zach. So I'll definitely stay in touch with you and I appreciate your time. Sounds good, Justin. Thank you. Take care.
