 if you extrapolate the curves that we've had so far, right? If you say, well, I don't know. We're starting to get to like PhD level. And last year we were at undergraduate level and the year before we were at like the level of a high school student. Again, you can you can quibble with at what tasks and for what? We're still missing modalities, but those are being added. Like computer use was added. Like if a generation has been added, if you just kind of like eyeball the rate at which these capabilities are increasing, it does make you think that we'll get there by 2026 or 2027. I think there are still worlds where it doesn't happen in a hundred years. Those worlds, the number of those worlds is rapidly decreasing. We are rapidly running out of truly convincing blockers, truly compelling reasons why this will not happen in the next few years. The scale up is very quick. Like we do this today. We make a model and then we deploy thousands, maybe tens of thousands of instances of it. I think by the time, you know, certainly within two to three years, whether we have these super powerful AIs or not, clusters are going to get to the size where you'll be able to deploy millions of these. I am optimistic about meaning. I worry about economics and the concentration of power. That's actually what I worry about more. The abuse of power and AI increases the amount of power in the world and if you concentrate that power and abuse that power, it can do immeasurable damage. Yes, it's very frightening. It's very frightening. The following is a conversation with Dario Amadeh, CEO of Enthropic. The company that created Claude, that is currently and often at the top of most LLM benchmark leaderboards. On top of that, Dario and the Enthropic team have been outspoken advocates for taking the top of AI safety very seriously. And they have continued to publish a lot of fascinating AI research on this and other topics. I'm also joined afterwards by two other brilliant people from Enthropic. First, Amanda Askel, who is a researcher working on alignment and fine tuning of Claude, including the design of Claude's character and personality. A few folks told me she has probably talked with Claude more than any human at Enthropic. So, she was definitely a fascinating person to talk to about prompt engineering and practical advice on how to get the best out of Claude. After that, Chris Ola, stopped by for a chat. He's one of the pioneers of the field of mechanistic interpretability, which is an exciting set of efforts that aims to reverse engineer neural networks. To figure out what's going on inside, inferring behaviors from neural activation patterns inside the network. This is a very promising approach for keeping future super intelligent AI systems safe. For example, by detecting from the activations, when the model is trying to deceive the human, it is talking to. This is Alex Friedman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Dario, Emma Day. Let's start with a big idea of scaling laws and the scaling hypothesis. What is it? What is it? History and what was then today? So, I can only describe it as it, you know, as it relates to kind of my own experience, but I've been in the AI field for about 10 years. And with something I noticed very early on. So, I first joined the AI world when I was working at Baidu with Andrewing in late 2014, which is almost exactly 10 years ago now. And the first thing we worked on was speech recognition systems. And in those days, I think deep learning was a new thing. It had made lots of progress. But everyone was always saying, we don't have the algorithms we need to succeed. We're not, we're only matching a tiny, tiny fraction. There's so much we need to kind of discover algorithmically. We haven't found the picture of how to match the human brain. And when, you know, in some ways it was fortunate, I was kind of, you know, you can have almost beginners look. I was like a newcomer to the field. And, you know, I looked at the neural net that we were using for speech, the recurrent neural networks. And I said, I don't know, what if you make a bigger and give them more layers. And what if you scale up the data along with this? Right? I just saw these as like independent dials that you could turn. And I noticed that the model started to do better and better. As you gave them more data, as you, as you made the models larger, as you trained them for longer. And I didn't measure things precisely in those days. But along with with colleagues, we very much got the informal sense that the more data and the more compute and the more training you put into these models, the better they perform. And so initially my thinking was, hey, maybe that is just true for speech recognition systems. Right? Maybe that's just one particular quirk, one particular area. I think it wasn't until 2017 when I first saw the results from GPT-1. That it clicked for me that language is probably the area in which we can do this. We can get trillions of words of language data. We can train on them. And the models we were trained in those days were tiny. You could train them on one to eight GPUs, whereas now we train jobs on tens of thousand soon going to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. And so when I saw those two things together, and you know, there were a few people like Iliasutskiver who you've interviewed who had somewhat similar reviews, right? He might have been the first one, although I think a few people came to similar views around the same time, right? There was, you know, rich substance, bitter lessen. There was Goron wrote about the scaling hypothesis. But I think somewhere between 2014 and 2017 was when it really clicked for me, when I really got conviction that, hey, we're going to be able to do these incredibly wide cognitive tasks if we just, if we just scale up the models. And at every stage of scaling, there are always arguments. And you know, when I first heard them, honestly, I thought probably I'm the one who's wrong. And you know, all these, all these experts in the field are right. They know the situation better, better than I do, right? There's, you know, the Trump's key argument about like you can get syntactics, but you can't get semantics. There is this idea. You can make a sentence, make sense. You can't make a paragraph, make sense. The latest one we have today is, you know, we're going to run out of data or the data is in high quality enough for models, can't reason. And each time every time we manage to, we manage to either find a way around or scaling just is the way around. Sometimes it's one, sometimes it's the other. And so I'm now at this point, I still think, you know, it's, it's always quite uncertain we have nothing but inductive inference to tell us that the next few years are going to be like the next, the last 10 years. But, but I've seen, I've seen the movie enough times. I've seen the story happen for enough times to really believe that probably the scaling is going to continue and that there's some magic to it that we haven't really explained on a theoretical basis yet. And of course, the scaling here is bigger networks, bigger data, bigger compute. Yes, all of this. In particular, linear scaling up of bigger networks, bigger training times and more and more data. So all of these things, almost like a chemical reaction. You know, you have three ingredients in the chemical reaction and you need to linearly scale up the three ingredients. If you scale up one, not the others, you run out of the other reagents and the reaction stops. But if you scale up everything, everything in series, then the reaction can proceed. And of course, now that you have this kind of empirical science slash art, you can apply to other more nuanced things like scaling laws applied to interpretability or scaling laws applied to post training or just seeing how does this thing scale? But the big scaling law, I guess the underlying scaling hypothesis has to do with big networks, big data leads to intelligence. Yeah, we've documented scaling laws in lots of domains other than language, right? So initially the paper we did that first showed it was in early 2020, where we first showed it for language. There was then some work late in 2020, where we showed the same thing for other modalities, like images, video, text image, image to text, math, they all had the same pattern. And you're right. Now there are other stages like post training or there are new types of reasoning models. And in all of those cases that we've measured, we see similar types of scaling laws. A bit of a philosophical question, but what's your intuition about why bigger is better in terms of network size and data size? Why does it lead to more intelligent models? So in my previous career as a biophysicist, I did physics undergrad and then biophysics in grad school. So I think back to what I know as a physicist, which is actually much less than what some of my colleagues said, and then drop it, cab, in terms of expertise and physics. There's this concept called the one over F noise and one over X distributions. Where often, just like if you add up a bunch of natural processes, you get a Gaussian. If you add up a bunch of kind of differently distributed natural processes. If you like, if you like take a probe and hook it up to a resistor, the distribution of the thermal noise and the resistor goes as one over the frequency. It's some kind of natural convergent distribution. And I think what an amount to is that if you look at a lot of things that are produced by some natural process that has a lot of different scales, right? Not a Gaussian, which is kind of narrowly distributed. But you know, if I look at kind of like large and small, frog fluctuations that lead to lead to electrical noise, they have this decaying one over X distribution. And so now I think of like patterns in the physical world, right? If I, or in language, if I think about the patterns in language, there are some really simple patterns. Some words are much more common than others like the. And there's basic noun verb structure, then there's the fact that, you know, nouns and verbs have to agree. They have to coordinate. And there's the higher level sentence structure, then there's the thematics structure of paragraphs. And so the fact that there's this regressing structure, you can imagine that as you make the networks larger, first they capture the really simple correlations, the really simple patterns. And there's this long tail of other patterns. And if that long tail of other patterns is really smooth like it is with the one over F noise in, you know, physical processes like like like resistors, then you can imagine as you make the network larger, it's kind of capturing more and more of that distribution. And so that smoothness gets reflected in how well the models are at predicting that how well they perform. Language is an evolved process, right? We've we've developed language. We have common words and less common words. We have common expressions and less common expressions. We have ideas who shades that are expressed frequently and we have novel ideas. And that process has has developed has evolved with humans over millions of years. And so the the gas and this is pure speculation would be would be that there is there's some kind of long tail distribution of of the distribution of these ideas. So there's the long tail, but also there's the height of the hierarchy of concepts that you're building up. So the bigger the network presumably you have a higher capacity to exactly. If you have a small network you only get the common stuff right. If if I take a tiny neural network, it's very good at understanding that you know, a sentence has to have you know, a verer magic to have now right, but it's it's terrible at deciding what those verer magic to have it now should be in what they should make sense. If I make it just a little bigger, it gets good at that. Then suddenly it's good at the sentences, but it's not good at the paragraphs. And so these these rare and more complex patterns get picked up as I add as I add more capacity to the network. Well, the natural question then is what's the ceiling of this? Yeah, how complicated and complex is the real world. How much does this stuff is there to learn? I don't think any of us knows the answer to that question. My strong instinct would be that there's no ceiling below level of humans. Right. We humans are able to understand these various patterns. And so that that makes me think that if we continue to you know scale up these these these models to kind of develop new methods for training them and scaling them up. That will at least get to the level that we've gotten to with humans. There's then a question of you know how much more is it possible to understand than humans do. How much how much is it possible to be smarter and more perceptive than humans. I would guess the answer has got to be domain dependent. If I look at an area like biology and you know I wrote this essay machines of loving grace, it seems to me that humans are struggling to understand the complexity of biology. Right. If you go to Stanford or Harvard or to Berkeley, you have whole departments of you know folks trying to study you know like the immune system or metabolic pathways. And and each person understands only a tiny bit part of it specializes and they're struggling to combine their knowledge with that of with that of other humans. And so I have an instinct that there's there's a lot of room at the top for AI's to get smarter. If I think of something like materials in the in the physical world or you know like addressing you know conflicts between humans or something like that. I mean you know it may be there's only some of these problems are not intractable but much harder. And and it may be that there's only there's only so well you can do it some of these things right just like with speech recognition there's only so clear. I can hear your speech so I think in some areas there may be ceilings in you know better very close to what humans have done in other areas those ceilings may be very far away. And I think we'll only find out when we build these systems. There's it's very hard to know in advance we can speculate but we can't be sure. And then some domains the ceiling might have to do with human bureaucracies and things like this as you write about. Yes, so humans fundamentally has to be part of the loop that's the cause of the ceiling not maybe the limits of the intelligence. Yeah, I think in many cases you know in theory technology could change very fast for example all the things that we might invent with respect to biology. But remember there's there's a you know there's a clinical trial system that we have to go through. And so we have to actually administer these things to humans I think that's a mixture of things that are unnecessary and bureaucratic and things that kind of protect the integrity of society and the whole challenge is that it's hard to tell. It's hard to tell what's going on it's hard to tell which is which right my my view is definitely. I think in terms of drug development we my view is that we're too slow and we're too conservative. And if you get these things wrong you know it's it's possible to to risk people's lives by by being by being by being too reckless and so at least at least some of these human institutions are in fact protecting people so it's it's all about finding the balance I strongly suspect that balance is kind of more on the side of pushing to make things happen faster but there is a balance. If we do hit a limit. If we do hit a slow down in the scaling laws what do you think would be the reason is it compute limited data limited. Is it something else. I deal limited so a few things now we're talking about hitting the limit before we get to the level of of humans and the skill of humans. So so I think one that's you know one that's popular today and I think you know could be a limit that we run into I like most of the limits I would bet against it but it's definitely possible. Is we simply run out of data there's only so much data on the internet and there's issues with the quality of the data right you can get. Hundreds of trillions of words on the internet but a lot of it is is repetitive or it's search engine you know search engine optimization, drivel or maybe the future will even be text generated by AI's itself. And so I think there are limits to what to what can be produced in this way that said we and I would guess other companies are working on ways to make data synthetic. Where you can you can use the model to generate more data of the type that you have that you have already or even generate data from scratch if you think about what was done with deep minds alpha goes zero they managed to get a bot all the way from. You know no ability to play go whatsoever to above human level just by playing against itself there was no example data from humans required in the the alpha goes zero version of it. The other direction of course is these reasoning models that do chain of thought and stop to think. And and reflect on their own thinking in a way that's another kind of synthetic data coupled with reinforcement learning so my my guesses with one of those methods will get around the data limitation or there may be other sources of data that are that are available. We could just observe that even if there's no problem with data as we start to scale models up they just stop getting better it's it's seen to be our reliable observation that they've gotten better that could just stop at some point for reason we don't understand. The answer could be that we need to you know we need to invent some new architecture it's been there have been problems in the past with say numerical stability of models we're looked like things were were leveling off but but actually you know when we when we found the right on blocker they didn't end up doing so so perhaps there's new some new. Optimization method or some new technique we need to to unblock things I've seen no evidence of that so far but if things were to slow down that perhaps could be one reason. What about the limits of compute. Meaning the expensive nature of building bigger bigger data centers so right now I think. Most of the frontier model companies I would guess are operating you know roughly you know one billion dollar scale plus or minus a factor of three right those are the models that exist now or being trained now. I think next year we're going to go to a few billion and then. 2026 we may go to you know above 10 10 billion and probably by 2027 there are ambitions to build 100 a hundred billion dollar 100 billion dollar clusters and I think all of that actually will happen there's a lot of determination to build the compute to do it within this country. And I would guess that it actually does happen now if we get to a hundred billion that's still not enough compute that's still not enough scale then either we need even more scale or we need to develop some way of doing it more efficiently if shifting the curve. I think between all of these one of the reasons I'm bullish about powerfully I happening so fast is just that if you extrapolate the next few points on the curve we're very quickly getting towards. Human level ability right some of the new models that that we developed some some some reasoning models that have come from other companies they're starting to get to what I would call the PhD or professional level right if you look at their their coding ability. And the latest model we released son it 3.5 the new updated version it gets something like 50% on sweet bench and sweet benches an example of a bunch of. Professional real world software engineering tasks at the beginning of the year I think the state of the art was three or four percent so in 10 months we've gone from 3% to 50% on this task and I think in another year we'll probably be at 90% I mean I don't know but might might even be. I think we've seen similar things in graduate level math physics and biology from models like open a eyes 01 so. If we if we just continue to extrapolate this right in terms of skill skill that we have I think if we extrapolate the straight curve within a few years we will get to these models being. You know above the the highest professional level in terms of humans now will that curve continue you point into an I've pointed to a lot of reasons what you know possible reasons why that might not happen. But if the if the extrapolation curve continues that is the trajectory we're on. So anthropic has several competitors it's interesting get your sort of view of it all open AI Google X ai meta what is the take to. When in the broad sense of when in the space yeah so I want to separate out a couple things right so you know and topics and topics mission is to kind of. Try to make this all go well right and and you know we have the theory of change called race to the top right race to the top is about trying to push. Push the other players to do the right thing by setting an example it's not about being the good guy it's about setting things up so that all of us can be the good guy. I'll give a few examples of this early in the history of anthropic one of our co-founders Chris all up who I believe you're interviewing soon. You know he's the co-founder the field of mechanistic interpretability which is an attempt to understand what's going on inside AI models. So we had him and one of our early teams focused on this area of interpretability which we think is good for making models safe and transparent. For three or four years that had no commercial application whatsoever it still doesn't today we're doing some early betas with it and probably it will eventually but. You know this is a very very long research bat in one in which we've built in public and share our results publicly and and we did this because you know we think it's a way to make model safer and interesting thing is that. As we've done this other companies have started doing it as well in some cases because they've been inspired by it in some cases because they're worried that. You know if if other companies are doing this that look more responsible they want to look more responsible to no one wants to look like the responsible actor and and so they adopt this they adopt this as well. When folks come to anthropic interpretability is often a draw and I tell them the other places you didn't go tell them why you came here and and then. You see soon that there that there's interpretability teams else elsewhere as well and in a way that takes away our competitive advantage because it's like oh that. Now others are doing it as well but it's good it's good for the broader system and so we have to invent some new thing that we're doing that others aren't doing as well on the hope. Is to basically bid up bid up the importance of of of doing the right thing and it's not it's not about us in particular right it's not about having. One particular good guy other companies can do this as well if they if they if they join the race to do this that's that's you know that's the best news ever right. It's it's just it's about kind of shaping the incentives to point upward instead of shaping the incentives to point to point downward and we should say this example the field of a mechanistic interpretability. Is just a rigorous non hand-wavy way of doing it as safety. Yeah, what's tending that way trying to I mean I think we're still early. In terms of our ability to see things but I've been surprised at how much we've been able to look inside these systems and understand what we see right unlike with the scaling laws where it feels like there's some. You know law that's driving these models to perform better on on the inside the models aren't you know there's no reason why they should be designed for us to understand them right they're designed to operate they're designed to work just like the human brain or human biochemistry. They're not designed for a human to open up the hatch look inside and understand them but we have found and you know you can talk in much more detail about this to Chris that when we open them up when we do look inside them we we find things that are surprisingly interesting. And as the side effect you also get to see the beauty of these models you get to explore the sort of beautiful nature of large and you on that works through the mech and turb kind of the dimension. I'm amazed at how clean it's been. I'm amazed at things like induction heads I'm amazed at things like that that we can you know you sparse auto encoders to find these directions within the networks. And that the directions correspond to these very clear concepts we demonstrated this a bit with the golden gate bridge clause so this was an experiment where we found a direction inside one of the neural networks layers that corresponded to the golden gate bridge and we just turned that way up and so. We we released this model as a demo is kind of half a joke for a couple days but it was it was a illustrative of the method we developed and. You could you could take the golden gate you could take the model you could ask it about anything you know you know be like how you could say how is your day anything you asked because this feature was activated would connect to the golden gate bridge so would say. You know I'm I'm feeling relaxed and expansive much like the archers of the golden gate bridge or you know it would masterfully change topic. Yeah, the golden gate bridge and integrated there is also sadness to it to to the focus ahead on the golden gate bridge. I think people quickly fun and love with it. I think so people already miss it because it was taken down I think after a day somehow these interventions on the model. Where where where where you kind of adjusted to behavior somehow emotionally made it seem more human. Yeah, than any other version of the model strong personality strong identity strong personality it has these kind of like obsessive interests. You know we can all think of someone who's like obsessed with something so it does make it feel somehow a bit more human. Let's talk about the present let's talk about Claude so this year a lot has happened in March. Claude 3, Opus on it, Hiku were released then Claude 3, 5, Sonna in July with an updated version just now released and then also Claude 3, 5, Hiku was released. Can you explain the difference between Opus, Sonna and Hiku and how we should think about the different versions. Yeah, so let's go back to March when we first released these three models. You know our thinking was different companies produce kind of large and small models better and worse models. We felt that there was demand both for a really powerful model. You know when you might be a little bit slower that you'd have to pay more for and also for fast cheap models that are as smart as they can be for how fast and cheap. Right whenever you want to do some kind of like you know difficult analysis like if I you know I want to write code for instance or you know I want to I want to brainstorm ideas or I want to do creative writing. I want the really powerful model but then there's a lot of practical applications and a business sense where it's like I'm interacting with a website. I you know like I'm like doing my taxes or I'm you know talking to you know to like a legal advisor and I want to analyze a contract or you know we have plenty of companies that are just like you know I want to do auto complete on my on my IDE or something. And for all of those things you want to act fast and you want to use the model very broadly so we want to serve that whole spectrum of needs. So we ended up with this you know this kind of poetry theme and so what's a really short poem it's a high coup and so high coup is the small fast cheap model that is you know was at the time was really surprisingly surprisingly intelligent for how fast and cheap it was. Sonnet is a is a medium size poem right a couple paragraphs and so sonnet was the middle model it is smarter but also a little bit slower a little bit more expensive and and opus like a magnum opus is a large work opus was the the largest smartest model at the time. So that that was the original kind of thinking behind it and our our thinking then was well each new generation of models should shift that trade off curve. So when we release sonnet 3.5 it has the same roughly the same you know cost and speed as the sonnet 3 model but it increased its intelligence the point where it was smarter than the original opus 3 model especially for code but but also just in general. And so now you know we've shown results for a high coup 3.5 and I believe high coup 3.5 the smallest new model is about as good as opus 3 the largest old model. So basically the aim here is to shift the curve and then at some point there's going to be an opus 3.5. Now every new generation of models has its own thing they use new data their personality changes in ways that we kind of you know try to steer but are not fully able to steer and so there's never quite that exact equivalence where the only thing you're changing is intelligence. We always try to improve other things and some things change without us knowing or measuring so it's it's very much an exact science in many ways the manner and personality of these models is more and are then it is a science. So what is sort of the reason for the span of time between say cloud opus 3.0 and 3.5 what is what takes that time if you can speak to. So there's different there's different processes there's pre training which is you know just kind of the normal language model training and that takes a very long time that uses you know these days you know. 10s you know tens of thousands sometimes many tens of thousands of GPUs or TPUs or training or you know what we use different platforms but you know accelerator chips often often training for months. 10s there's then a kind of post training phase where we do reinforcement learning from human feedback as well as other kinds of reinforcement learning that that phase is getting larger and larger now and you know you know often that's less of an exact science it often takes effort to get it right. 10s the model of the test it with some of our early partners to see how good they are and they're then tested both internally and externally for their safety particularly for catastrophic and autonomy risks. 10s we do internal testing according to our responsible scaling policy which I you know could talk more about that in detail. And then we have an agreement with the US and the UK AI safety institute as well as other third party testers and specific domains to test the models for what are called. CBRN risk chemical biological radiological and nuclear which are you know we don't think that models pose these risks seriously yet but but every new model we want to evaluate to see if we're starting to get close to some of these these these more dangerous. 10s these more dangerous capabilities so those are the phases and then you know then then it just takes some time to get the model working in terms of inference and want you to in the API so there's just a lot of steps to. 10s to actually actually making a model work and of course you know we're always trying to make the processes as streamlined as possible right we want our safety testing to be rigorous but we want it to be rigorous and. 10s to be automatic to happen as fast as it can without compromising on rigor same with our pre-training process and our post training process so. You know it's just like building anything else it's just like building airplanes you want to make them you know you want to make them safe but you want to make the process streamlined and I think. And so the idea of tension between those is you know is an important thing and making the models work yeah room around the street I forget who was saying that and tropical is really good tooling so. 10s to be able to have a. 10s to be able to have a like a efficient low friction interaction with the infrastructure you would be surprised how much of the challenges of. 10s touching these models comes down to you know soft for engineering performance engineering you know you know from the outside you might think oh man we have this you recap break through right you know this movie with the signs we discovered it we figured it out but. I think all things, even incredible discoveries, like they almost always come down to the details. And often super, super boring details, I can't speak to whether we have better tooling than other companies. I mean, you know, haven't been at those other companies, at least at least not recently, but it's certainly something we give a lot of attention to. I don't know if you can say, but from three, from Cloud 3 to Cloud 3, five, is there any extra pre-training going on? As I mostly focus on the post-training, there's been leaps in performance. Yeah, I think at any given stage, we're focused on improving everything at once. Just naturally, like their different teams, each team makes progress in a particular area in making a particular segment of the relay race better. And it's just natural that when we make a new model, we put all of these things in at once. So the data you have, like the preference data you get from RLHF, is that applicable? Is there a way to apply it to newer models? As it get trained up? Yeah, preference data from old models, sometimes gets used for new models. Although, of course, it performs somewhat better when it's trained on the new models. Note that we have this constitutional AI method such that we don't only use preference data, we kind of, there's also a post-training process where we train the model against itself. And there's new types of post-training the model, and it's self-interviewed every day. So it's not just RLHF, it's a bunch of other methods as well. Post-training, I think, is becoming more and more sophisticated. Well, what explains the big leap in performance for the new Sonic 35? I mean, at least in the programming side. I mean, if this is a good place to talk about benchmarks, what isn't going to get better? Just the number one up. But I'd program, but I also love programming, and I clawed 35 through cursors, what I use to assist me in programming. And at least, experimentially, and it's gotten smarter at programming. So what does it take to get it smarter? We observe that as well, by the way. There were a couple very strong engineers here at Anthropic, who all previous code models, both produced by us, then produced by all the other companies, hadn't really been useful to them. They said, maybe this is useful to beginner, it's not useful to me. But Sonic 3.5, the original one for the first time, they said, oh my god, this helped me with something that it would have taken the hours to do. This is the first model that was actually saved me time. So again, the water line is rising. And then I think the new Sonic has been even better. In terms of what it takes, I mean, I'll just say it's been across the board. It's in the pre-training, it's in the post-training. It's in various evaluations that we do. We've observed this as well. And if we go into the details of the benchmark, so sweet bench is basically, since your programmer, you'll be familiar with pull requests, and just pull requests, sort of a topic unit of work. You could say, I'm implementing one thing. And so sweet bench actually gives you a real-world situation where the code base is in a current state. And I'm trying to implement something that's described in the scribed in language. We have internal benchmarks where we measure the same thing. And you say, just give the model free reign to do anything, run anything, edit anything, how well is it able to complete these tasks. And it's that benchmark that's gone from it. It can do it 3% of the time to it can do it about 50% of the time. So I actually do believe that if we get, you can gain benchmarks, but I think if we get to 100% on that benchmark and in a way that isn't kind of like overtrained or game for that particular benchmark, probably represent a real and serious increase in kind of programming, programming ability. And I would suspect that if we can get to 99%. That it will represent ability to autonomously do a significant fraction of software engineering tasks. Well, ridiculous timeline question. When is Cloud Opus 3.5 coming up? Not giving you an exact date, but there, as far as we know, the plan is still to have a Cloud 3.5 Opus. Are we gonna get it before GTA 6 or not? Like Duke Nukem forever. You know, there was some game that was delayed 15 years. Is that Duke Nukem forever? Yeah. And I think GTA is not just releasing trailers. You know, it's only been three months since we released the first on it. Yeah, it's incredible pace of release. But it just tells you about the pace. Yeah. The expectations for one thing is you're gonna come out. So what about 40? So how do you think about sort of as these models get bigger and bigger about versioning? And also just versioning in general, why Sonic 3.5 updated with the date? Why not? Sonic 3.6, which I love actually. The naming is actually an interesting challenge here, right? Because I think a year ago, most of the model was pre-training. And so you could start from the beginning and just say, okay, we're gonna have models of different sizes. We're gonna train them all together. And you know, we'll have a family of naming schemes. And then we'll put some new magic into them. And then, you know, we'll have the next generation. The trouble starts already when some of them take a lot longer than other to train, right? That already messes up your time, time a little bit. But as you make big improvements in, as you make big improvements in pre-training, then you suddenly notice, oh, I can make better pre-trained model and that doesn't take very long to do. And but you know, clearly it has the same size and shape of previous models. So I think those two together as well with the timing issues, any kind of scheme you come up with that, you know, the reality tends to kind of frustrate that scheme, right? Ten tends to kind of break out of the, break out of the scheme. It's not like software, you can say, oh, this is like, you know, 3.7, this is 3.8. No, you have models with different trade-offs. You can change some things in your models. You can train, you can change other things. Some are faster and slower in front. Some have to be more expensive. Some have to be less expensive. And so I think all the companies have struggled with this. I think we did very, you know, I think we were in a good position in terms of naming when we had Hiku, Sonnet and Chris. Great. We're trying to maintain it, but it's not, it's not perfect. So we'll, we'll try and get back to this simplicity, but it, it, it, just the, the nature of the field. I feel like no one's figured out naming. It's somehow a different paradigm from like normal software. And, and so we, we just, not of the companies have been perfect at it. And it's something we struggle with, surprisingly much relative to, you know, how relative to how trivial it is, you know, for the, the, the, the grand science of training the models. So from the user side, the user experience of the updated Sonnet 35 is just different than the previous June, 2024, Sonnet 35. It would be nice to come up with some kind of labeling that embodies that. Because people talk about Sonnet 35, but now there's a different one. And so how do you refer to the previous one and the new one? And it, it, when there's a distinct improvement, it just makes conversation about it, just challenging. Yeah. Yeah. I definitely think this question of there are lots of properties of the models that are not reflected in the benchmarks. I think that's, that's definitely the case and everyone agrees. And not all of them are capabilities. Some of them are, you know, models can be polite or brusk. They can be, you know, very reactive or they can ask you questions. They can have what, what feels like a warm personality or a cold personality. They can be boring or they can be very distinctive like Golden Gate Cloud was. And we have a whole, you know, we have a whole team kind of focused on, I think we call it Cloud character Amanda leads that team and we'll, we'll talk to you about that. But it's still a very inexact science. And, and, and often we find that models have properties that we're not aware of. The, the fact of the matter is that you can, you know, talk to a model 10,000 times and there are some behaviors you might not see. Just like just like with a human, right? I can know someone for a few months and, you know, not know that they have a certain skill or not know that there's a certain side to them. And so I think, I think we just have to get used to this idea and we're always looking for better ways of testing our models to, to demonstrate these capabilities and, and also to decide which are, which are the, which are the personality properties we want models to have in which we don't want to have that itself. The normative question is also super interesting. I gotta ask you a question from Reddit. From Reddit. Oh boy. You know, there, there's just a fascinating to me, at least it's a psychological social phenomenon. Where people report that Claude has gotten dumb enough for them over time. And so the question is does the user complaint about the dumbing down of Claude 35 son at Hold Any Water? So are these anecdotal reports, it kind of social phenomena or did Claude, is there any cases where Claude would get dumber? So this actually doesn't apply, this isn't just about Claude. I believe this, I believe I've seen these complaints for every foundation model produced by major company. People said this about GPT4, they said it about GPT4 turbo. So, so, so, so couple things. One, the actual weights of the model, right? The actual brain of the model, that does not change unless we introduce a new model. There, there're just a number of reasons why it would not make sense practically to be randomly substituting in substituting in new versions of the model. It's difficult from an inference perspective and it's actually hard to control all the consequences of changing the weight of the model. Let's say you wanted to find two in the model to be like, I don't know, to say certainly less, which, you know, an old version of son that used to do. You actually end up changing 100 things as well. So we have a whole process for it and we have a whole process for modifying the model. We do a bunch of testing on it. We do a bunch of, like, we do a bunch of user testing in early customers. So, we both have never changed the weights of the model without telling anyone. And it wouldn't, certainly in the current setup, it would not make sense to do that. Now, there are a couple things that we do occasionally do. One is sometimes we run AB tests. But those are typically very close to when a model is being released and for a very small fraction of time. So, you know, like the day before the new son at 3.5, I agree. We should have had better name. It's a clunky to refer to it. There were some comments from people that like it's gotten a lot better. And that's because, you know, a fraction were exposed to an AB test for those one or two days. The other is that occasionally the system prompt will change. The system prompt can have some effects, although it's unlikely to dumb down models. It's unlikely to make them dumber. And we've seen that while these two things, which I'm listing to be very complete, happen relatively, happen quite infrequently. The complaints about, for us and for other model companies about the model change, the model isn't good at this. The model got more censored. The model was dumbed down. Those complaints are constant. And so, I don't want to say like, people are managing to do anything, but like, the models are for the most part not changing. If I were to offer a theory, I think it actually relates to one of the things I said before, which is that models have many, are very complex and have many aspects to them. And so, often, if I ask them a model a question, if I'm like, do task acts versus can you do task acts? The model might respond in different ways. And so, there are all kinds of subtle things that you can change about the way you interact with the model that can give you very different results. To be clear, this itself is like a failing by us and by the other model providers that the models are just offensive to like small changes in word. It's yet another way in which the science of how these models work is very poorly developed. And so, if I go to sleep one night and I was like talking the model in a certain way, and I like slightly change the phrasing of how I talk to the model, you know, I could get different results. So, that's one possible way. The other thing is, man, it's just hard to quantify this stuff. It's hard to quantify this stuff. I think people are very excited by new models when they come out, and then as time goes on, they become very aware of the limitations. So, that may be another effect, but that's all a very long-rended way of saying, for the most part, with some fairly narrow exceptions, the models are not changing. I think there is a psychological effect. You just start getting used to it, the baseline raises. Like when people have first gotten Wi-Fi on airplanes, it's like a major... Like a major... Yeah, and then... Now I want to... Get this thing to work. This is such a piece of crap. Exactly. So, these are to have the conspiracy theory that they're making Wi-Fi slower and slower. This is probably something I'll talk to Amanda much more about, but another Reddit question. One will plot stuff trying to be my pure, a tannical grandmother imposing its moral worldview on me as a paying customer. And also, what does this ecology behind making cloud overly apologetic? So, this kind of reports about the experience at different angle in the frustration. It has to do with the character. Yeah, so a couple points on this first. One is things that people say on Reddit and Twitter or actual wherever it is. There's actually a huge distribution shift between the stuff that people complain loudly about on social media and what actually kind of like, statistically users care about and that drives people to use the models. People are frustrated with things like the model, not writing out all the code or the model. Just not being as good at code as it could be, even though it's the best model in the world on code. I think the majority of things are about that. But certainly a kind of vocal minority are kind of raised these concerns, right? Our frustrated by the model refusing things that shouldn't refuse or like apologizing too much. Or just just having these kind of annoying verbal ticks. The second caveat, and I just want to say this super clearly because I think it's like, some people don't know what others like, kind of know it, but forget it. Like, it is very difficult to control across the board how the model's behave. You cannot just reach in there and say, oh, I want the model to like apologize less. Like, you can do that. You can include trading data that says, like, oh, the model should like apologize less. But then in some other situation, they end up being like super rude or like overconfident in a way that's like misleading people. So there are all these trade-offs. For example, another thing is if there was a period during which models ours and I think others as well were two verbose, right? They would like repeat themselves. They would say too much. You can cut down on the verbosity by penalizing the models for just talking for too long. What happens when you do that, if you do it in a crude way, is when the models are coding, sometimes they'll say, rest of the code goes here, right? Because they've learned that that's a way to economize and that they see it and then so that leaves the model to be so called lazy encoding, where they're just like, oh, you can finish the rest of it. It's not because we want to save on compute or because the models are lazy and during winter break, or any of the other kind of conspiracy theories that have come up, it's just very hard to control the behavior of the model, to steer the behavior of the model in all circumstances at once. You can kind of, there's this whack-a-mo aspect where you push on one thing and like, you know, these other things start to move as well, that you may not even notice or measure. And so one of the reasons that I care so much about kind of grand alignment of the AI systems in the future is actually these systems are actually quite unpredictable. They're actually quite hard to steer in control. And this version we're seeing today of, you may want to think better it makes another thing worse. I think that's, that's like a present day analog of future control problems in AI systems that we can start to study today. Right? I think that that difficulty in steering the behavior and making sure that if we push an AI system in one direction, it doesn't push in another direction in some other ways that we didn't want. I think that's kind of an early sign of things to come. And if we can do a good job of solving this problem, right? Of like, you ask the model to like, you know, to like make and distribute smallpox and it says no, but it's willing to help you in your graduate level of biology class. Like, how do we get both of those things at once? It's hard. It's very easy to go to one side or the other. And it's a multi-dimensional problem. And so I, you know, I think these questions of like shaping the model's personality. I think they're very hard. I think we haven't done perfectly on them. I think we've actually done the best of all the AI companies, but still so far from perfect. And I think if we can get this right, if we can control the, you know, control the false positives and false negatives, in this, this is very kind of controlled present day environment, will be much better at doing it for the future. When our worry is, you know, the model's be super autonomous. Will they be able to, you know, make very dangerous things. Will they be able to autonomously, you know, build whole companies and are those companies aligned. So, so I, I think of this, this present task as both vaccine, but also good practice for the future. What's the current best way of gathering sort of user feedback? Like not anecdotal data, but just large scale data about pain points or the opposite of pain points positive things. So, is it internal testing? Is it yeah, specific group testing a B testing? What work? So, so, so typically, we'll have internal model bashings where all of anthropic and tropical is almost 1000 people. You know, people just just try and break the model. They try and interact with it various ways. We have a suite of e-values for, you know, oh, it's the model refusing in ways that it couldn't. I think we even had a certainly e-val because, you know, our, our, again, one point model had this problem where like it had this annoying tick where it would like respond to a wide range of questions by saying, certainly, I can help you with that. Certainly, I would be happy to do that. Certainly, this is correct. And so we had a, like, certainly, e-val, which is like how often does the model say certainly? Yeah. But look, this is just a whack-a-mole. Like, like, what if it switches from certainly to definitely? Like, so, you know, every time we add a new e-val and we're always evaluating for all the old things. So, we have hundreds of these evaluations, but we find that there's no substitute for human interacting with it. And so, it's very much like the ordinary product development process. We have, like, hundreds of people within anthropic bash the model, then we do, you know, then we do external AB tests. Sometimes we'll run tests with contractors. We pay contractors to interact with the model. So, you put all of these things together and it's still not perfect. You still see behaviors that you don't quite want to see, right? You know, you see, you still see the model, like refusing things that it just doesn't make sense to refuse. But I, I think trying to try and to solve this challenge, right? Trying to stop the model from doing, you know, genuinely bad things that, you know, know what everyone agrees it shouldn't do, right? You know, everyone, everyone, everyone, you know, everyone agrees that, you know, the model shouldn't talk about, you know, I don't know, child abuse material, right? Like everyone agrees the model shouldn't do that. But, but at the same time that it doesn't refuse in these dumb and stupid ways, I think I think drawing that line as finely as possible, approaching perfectly is still a challenge. And we're getting better at it every day, but there's, there's a lot to be solved. And again, I would point to that as, as an indicator of a challenge ahead in terms of steering much more powerful models. Do you think Claude 4.0 is ever coming up? I don't want to commit to any naming scheme because if I say, if I say here, we're going to have Claude 4 next year and then, and then, you know, then we decide that like, you know, we should start over because there's a new type of model. Like, I, I, I, I don't want to, I don't want to commit to it. I would expect an normal course of business that Claude 4 would come after Claude 3.5, but, but, you know, you know, you never know in this wacky field, right? But, sort of this idea of scaling is continuing. Scaling is continuing. There, there will definitely be more powerful models coming from us in the models that exist today. That is, that is certain or if there, if there aren't, we've, we've deeply failed as a company. Okay. Can you explain the responsible scaling policy and the AI safety level standards, AI levels? Yes. As much as I'm excited about the benefits of these models, and we know we'll talk about that if we talk about machines of loving grace, I'm, I'm worried about the risks and I continue to be worried about the risks. No one should think that, you know, machines of loving grace was me, me saying, you know, I'm no longer worried about the risks of these models. I think they're two sides of the same coin. The power of the models and their ability to solve all these problems in, you know, biology, neuroscience, economic development, governance, and peace, large parts of the economy, those, those come with risks as well, right, with great power comes great responsibility, right? That's the, the, the, the two are, the two are paired, things that are powerful can do good things, and they can do bad things. I think of those risks as, as being, you know, several different categories, perhaps the two biggest risks that I think about, and that's not to say that there aren't risks today that are, that are important, but when I think of the really, you know, the things that would happen on the grandest scale, one is what I call catastrophic misuse. These are misuse of the models in domains like cyber, bio, radiological, nuclear, right, things that could, you know, that could harm or even kill thousands, even millions of people if they really, really go wrong. On like these are the, you know, number one priority to prevent, and here, I would just make a simple observation, which is that, the models, you know, if, if I look today at people who have done really bad things in the world, I think actually humanity has been protected by the fact that the overlap between really smart, well-educated people, and people who want to do really horrific things, has generally been small. Like, you know, let's say, let's say I'm someone who, you know, you know, I have a PhD in this field, I have a well-paying job. There's so much to lose. Why do I want to like, you know, even though assuming I'm completely evil, which, which most people are not. Why, why, you know, why would such a person risk their risk their, you know, risk their life, risk their, their legacy, their reputation to do something like, you know, truly, truly evil. If we had a lot more people like that, the world would be a much more dangerous place. And so my, my worry is that by being a, a much more intelligent agent, AI could break that correlation. And so I, I do have serious worries about that. I believe we can prevent those worries, but, you know, I think as a counterpoint to machines of loving grace, I want to say that this is, that I, this still serious risks. And, and the second range of risk would be the autonomy risks, which is the idea that models might on their own, particularly as we give them more agency than they've had in the past, particularly as we give them supervision over wider tasks like, you know, writing whole code bases or some day, even, you know, effectively operating an entire entire companies, they're on a long enough leash. Are they, are they doing what we really want them to do? It's very difficult to, even understand and detail what they're doing, let alone, let alone control it. And like I said, this, these early signs that it's, it's hard to perfectly draw the boundary between things the model should do and things the model shouldn't do that, that, that, you know, if, if you go to one side, you get things that are annoying and useless and you go to the other side, you get other behaviors. If you fix one thing, it creates other problems. We're getting better and better at solving this. I don't think this is an unsolvable problem. I think this is, you know, this is a science like like the safety of airplanes, or the safety of cars, or the safety of drugs. I, you know, I don't think there's any big thing we're missing. I just think we need to get better at controlling these models. And so these are, these are the two risks I'm worried about. And our responsible scaling plan, which all recognizes a very long-winded answer to your question, our, our responsible scaling plan is designed to address these two types of risks. And so every time we develop a new model, we basically test it for its ability to do both of these bad things. So if I were to back up a little bit, I think we have it, I think we have an interesting dilemma with AI systems, where they're not yet powerful enough to present these catastrophes. I don't know that I don't know they'll ever present prevent these catastrophes. It's possible they won't. But the the case for work, the case for risk is strong enough that we should, we should act now. And they're getting better very, very fast. Right? I, you know, I testified in the Senate that, you know, we might have serious bio risks within two to three years. That was about a year ago. Things have preceded, preceded a pace. So we have this thing where it's like it's, it's surprisingly hard to, to address these risks because they're not here today. They don't exist. They're light ghosts. But they're coming at us so fast because the models were improving so fast. So how do you deal with something that's not here today doesn't exist, but is coming at us very fast. So the solution we came up with for that in collaboration with, you know, people like the organization, meter and Paul Cristiano is, okay, what, what, what, you need for that, are you need tests to tell you when the risk is getting close? You need an early warning system. And, and so every time we have a new model, we test it for its capability to do these CBRN tasks as well as testing it for, you know, how capable it is of doing tasks autonomously on its own. And in the latest version of our RRSP, which we released in the last, in the last month or two, the way we test autonomy risks is the model, the AI models ability to do aspects of AI research itself, which when the model, when the AI models can do AI research, they become kind of truly truly autonomous. And that, you know, that's threshold is important for a bunch of other ways. And, and so what do we then do with these tasks? The RSP basically develops what we've called an if-then structure, which is if the model's pass of certain capability, then we impose a certain set of safety and security requirements on them. So today's models are what's called ASL2. Models that were ASL1 is for systems that manifestly don't pose any risk of autonomy or misuse. So for example, a chess plane bought, deep blue would be ASL1. It's just manifestly the case that you can't use deep blue for anything other than chess. It was just designed for chess. No one's going to use it to like, you know, to conduct a masterful cyber attack or to, you know, run wild and take over the world. ASL2 is today's AI systems, where we've measured them and we think these systems are simply not smart enough to, you know, autonomously self-replicate or conduct a bunch of tasks and also not smart enough to provide meaningful information about CBRN risks and how to build CBRN weapons above and beyond what can be known from looking at Google. In fact, sometimes they do provide information but not above and beyond a search engine but not in a way that can be stitched together, not in a way that kind of end to end is dangerous enough. So ASL3 is going to be the point at which the models are hopeful enough to enhance the capabilities of non-state actors. Right. State actors can already do a lot of, unfortunately, to a high level of proficiency, a lot of these very dangerous and destructive things. The difference is that non-state actors are not capable of it. And so when we get to ASL3, we'll take special security precautions designed to be sufficient to prevent, after the model by non-state actors and misuse of the model as it's deployed, we'll have to have enhanced filters targeted at these particular areas, cyber, bio, nuclear, cyber, bio, nuclear and model autonomy, which is less than misuse risk and more risk of the model doing bad things itself. ASL4, getting to the point where these models could, it could enhance the capability of a already knowledgeable state actor and or become the main source of such a risk. Like if you wanted to engage in such a risk, the main way you would do it is through a model. And then I think ASL4 on the autonomy side, it's some, some amount of acceleration in AI research capabilities with it, within AI model. And then ASL5 is where we would get to the models that are kind of truly capable. It could exceed humanity and there are ability to do any of these tasks. And so the point of the if-then structure commitment is basically to say, look, I don't know, I've been working with these models for many years and I've been worried about risk for many years. It's actually kind of dangerous to cry wolf. It's actually kind of dangerous to say, this model is risky and people look at it and they say this is manifestly not dangerous. Again, it's the the delicacy of the risk isn't here today, but it's coming out as fast. How do you deal with that? It's really vexing to a risk planner to deal with it. And so this if then structure basically says, look, we don't want to antagonize a bunch of people. We don't want to harm our own, you know, our our our kind of own ability to have a place in the conversation by imposing these these very honorists burdens on models that are not dangerous today. So the if then the trigger commitment is basically a way to deal with this. It says you clamped down hard when you can show that the model is dangerous. And of course, what has to come with that is you know enough of a buffer threshold that you know, you can you know, you're you're you're you're not at high risk of kind of missing the danger. It's not a perfect framework. We've had to change it every every you know, we came out with a new one just a few weeks ago and probably probably going forward, we might release new ones multiple times a year because it's it's hard to get these policies right like technically, organizationally from a research perspective, but that is the proposal if then commitments and triggers in order to minimize burdens and false alarms now, but really react appropriately when the dangers are here. What do you think that timeline for SL3 is where several of the triggers are fired and what do you think the timeline is for SL4? Yeah, so that is hotly debated within the company. We are working actively to prepare ASL3 security security measures as well as ASL3 deployment measures. I'm not going to go into detail, but we've made we've made a lot of progress on both and you know, we're prepared to be I think ready quite soon. I would not be surprised at all if we hit ASL3 next year. There was some concern that we might even hit it this year that's still that's still possible that could still happen. It's like very hard to say, but like I would be very very surprised if it was like 2030. I think it's much sooner than that. So there's a protocols for detecting it if then and then there's protocols for how to respond to it. Yes, how difficult is the second the latter? Yeah, I think for ASL3, it's primarily about security and about filters on the model relating to a very narrow set of areas when we deploy the model because ASL3, the model isn't autonomous yet. And so you don't have to worry about kind of the model itself behaving in a bad way even when it's deployed internally. So I think the ASL3 measures are I won't say straight forward. They're they're rigorous, but they're easier to reason about. I think once we get to ASL4, we start to have worries about the models being smart enough that they might sandbag test. They might not tell the truth about tests. We had some results came out about like sleep regions and there was a more recent paper about can the models mislead attempts to sandbag their own abilities. So they present themselves as being less capable than they are. And so I think with ASL4, there's going to be an important component of using other things than just interacting with the models. For example, interpretability or hidden in chains of thought. Where you have to look inside the model and verify via some other mechanism that is not as easily corrupted as what the model says that the model indeed has some property. So we're still working on ASL4. One of the properties of the RSP is that we don't specify ASL4 until we've hit ASL3. And I think that's proven to be a wise decision because even with ASL3, it again, it's hard to know this stuff in detail. And we want to take as much time as we can possibly take to get these things right. So for ASL3, the bad act will be the humans. Yes. So there's a little bit more for ASL4, it's both. I think it's both. So deception and that's where mechanistic interpretability comes into play. And hopefully the techniques used for that are not made accessible to the model. Yeah, I mean, of course you can hook up the mechanistic interpretability to the model itself. But then you've kind of lost it as reliable indicator of the model state. There are a bunch of exotic ways you can think of that it might also not be reliable. Like if the model gets smart enough that it can jump computers and read the code where you're looking at its internal state, we've thought about some of those. I think they're exotic enough. There are ways for vendor them unlikely. But yeah, generally you want to you want to preserve mechanistic interpretability as a kind of verification set or test set that separate from the training process of the model. See, I think as these models become better and better conversation and become smarter, social engineering becomes a threat to because they they can start being very convincing to the engineers and side companies. Oh yeah, yeah, it's actually like, you know, we've seen lots of examples of demagogery in our life from humans and you know, there's a concern that models could do that could do that as well. One of the ways that cloud has been getting more and more powerful is it's not able to do some agentic stuff. Computer use, there's also an analysis within the sandbox of cloud.ai itself, but let's talk about computer use. That seems to me super exciting that you can just give cloud a task and it takes a bunch of actions figures it out and it's access to the your computer through screenshots. So can you explain how that works? And where that's headed. Yeah, it's actually relatively simple. So cloud has had for a long time since since cloud three back in March, the ability to analyze images and respond to them with text. The only new thing we added is those images can be screenshots of a computer. And in response, we train the model to give a location on the screen where you can click and or buttons on the keyboard, you can press in order to take action. And it turns out that with actually not all that much additional training, the models can get quite good at that task. It's a good example of generalization. You know, people sometimes say if you get to lower for a bit, you're like halfway to anywhere, right? Because of how much it takes to escape the gravity well. If you have a strong free train model, I feel like you're halfway to anywhere in terms of in terms of the intelligent space. And so actually it didn't take all that much to get to get cloud to do this. And you can just set that in a loop, give the model screen shot, tell it what to click on, give it the next screen shot, tell it what to click on. And that turns into a full kind of almost 3D video interaction of the model. And it's able to do all of these tasks. Right? You know, we showed these demos were it's able to like fill out spreadsheet, to table to kind of like interact with a website. It's able to, you know, you know, it's able to open all kinds of, you know, programs, different operating systems, Windows, Linux, Mac. So, you know, I think all of that is very exciting. I will say, while in theory, there's nothing you could do there that you couldn't have done through just giving the model the API to drive the computer screen. This really lowers the barrier. And, you know, there's, there's a lot of folks who, who either, you know, kind of kind of, are, you know, aren't in a position to interact with those APIs or takes them a long time to do. It's just the screen is just a universal interface that's a lot easier to interact with. And so I expect over time, this is going to lower a bunch of barriers. Now, honestly, the current model has, there's, it leaves a lot still to be desired. And we were, we were honest about that in the blog. Right? It makes mistakes, it misclicks. And we, you know, we were careful to warn people, hey, this thing isn't, you can't just leave this thing to, you know, run on your computer for minutes and minutes. You got to give this thing boundaries and guard rails. And I think that's one of the reasons we released it first in an API form rather than kind of, you know, this, this kind of just, just hand, just hand just the consumer and, and give it control of their, of their, of their computer. But, but, you know, I definitely feel that it's important to get these capabilities out there as models get more powerful. We're going to have to grapple with, you know, how do we use these capabilities safely? How do we prevent them from being abused? And, you know, I think I think releasing the model while, while the capabilities are, you know, are still, are still limited is, is very helpful in terms of, in terms of doing that. You know, I think since it's been released, a number of customers, I think, our, rapid, it was maybe, was maybe one of the, the most quickest, quickest, quickest, to deploy things, have, you know, have made use of it in various ways. People have hooked up demos for, you know, Windows, Dash, Top, Macs, you know, Linux, Linux, machines. So, yeah, it's been, it's been, it's been very exciting. I think as with, as with anything else, you know, it, it, it, it comes with new exciting abilities. And then, then, then, you know, then, then, then with those new exciting abilities, we have to think about how to, how to, you know, make the model, you know, say, reliable, do what humans want them to do. I mean, to the same, it's the same story for everything, right? Same thing, it's that same tension. But, but the possibility of use cases here is just the, the range is incredible. So, how much to make it work really well in the future? How much do you have to especially kind of go beyond what's the pre-trained models doing? Do more post-training RLHF or Supervisor Finan2 and EUR, synthetic data just for the agent? Yeah, I think speaking at a high level, it's our intention to keep investing a lot in, you know, making the model better. Like, I think, I think, you know, we look at, look at some of the, you know, some of the Bench Marx were previous models were like, oh, could do it six percent of the time. And now, our model had to do it 14 or 22 percent of the time. And, yeah, we want to get up to, you know, the human level reliability of 89 percent, just like anywhere else, right? We're on the same curve that we were on with Sween-Bent, where I think I would guess a year from now, the models can do this very, very reliably, but you got to start somewhere. So, he's thinking it's possible to get to the human level 90 percent, basically doing the same thing you're doing now, or is it has to be special for computers? I mean, depends what you mean by, you know, special and, special and general, but, but, you know, I, I generally think, you know, the same kinds of techniques that we've been using to train the current model, I expect that doubling down on those techniques in the same way that we have for code, for code, for models in general, for other kit, for, you know, for image input, you know, for voice, I expect those same techniques will scale here as they have everywhere else. But, this is giving sort of the power of action to claw and so you could do a lot of really powerful things, but you could do a lot of damage also. Yeah. Yeah. No, and we've been very aware of that. Look, my view actually is computer use isn't a fundamentally new capability like the CBRN or autonomy capabilities are. It's more like it kind of opens the aperture for the model to use and apply its existing abilities. And so the way we think about it, going back to our RSP is nothing that this model is doing inherently increases, you know, the risk from an RSP, RSP perspective, but as the models get more powerful, having this capability may make it scarier once it, you know, once it has the cognitive capability to, you know, to do something at the ASL3 and ASL4 level, this, this, you know, this may be the thing that kind of unbound it from doing so. So going forward, certainly this modality of interaction is something we have tested for and that we will continue to test for an RSP going forward. I think it's probably better to have to learn and explore this capability before the model is super, you know, super capable. Yeah, there's a lot of interesting attacks like prompt injection because now you've widened the aperture so you can prompt inject through stuff on screen. So if this becomes more and more useful, then there's more more benefit to inject, inject stuff into the model. If it goes to certain webpage, it could be harmless stuff like advertisements or it could be like harmful stuff. Right. Yeah, I mean, we've thought a lot about things like spam, capture, you know, mass camp. There's all, you know, every every like, if once you could all tell you, if you've invented a new technology, not necessarily the biggest misuse, but the the first misuse you'll see scams, just petty scams. Like, you'll just, just, it's like, it's like a thing is all people scamming each other. It's this, it's this thing is all this time. And, and it's just, every time you got to deal with it, it's almost like silly to say, but it's true sort of bots and spam in general is the thing is, it's just more and more intelligent. Yes, it's just there are a lot of, like, like I said, like there are a lot of petty criminals in the world. And, and, and, you know, it's like every new technology is like a new way for petty, petty criminals to do something, you know, something stupid and malicious. Is there any ideas about sandboxing it? Like how difficult is the sandboxing task? Yeah, we sandboxed during training. So, for example, during training, we didn't expose the model to the internet. I think that's probably a bad idea during training because, you know, the model can be changing its policy, it can be changing what it's doing and it's having an effect in the real world. You know, in terms of actually deploying the model, right, it kind of depends in the application. Like, you know, sometimes you want the model to do something in the real world, but of course, you can always put guardrails on the outside, right? You can say, okay, well, you know, this model's not going to move data from my, you know, model's not going to move any files from my computer or my web server to anywhere else. Now, when you talk about sandboxing, again, when we get to ASL4, none of these precautions are going to make sense there, right, where when you talk about ASL4, you're then the model is being kind of, you know, there's a theoretical worry the model could be smart enough to break it to kind of break out of any box. And so there, we need to think about mechanistic interpretability about, you know, if we're going to have a sandbox, it would need to be a mathematically approval sandbox, you know, that's a whole different world than what we're dealing with with the models today. Yeah, the science of building a box from which ASL4 ASL4 system cannot escape. I think it's probably not the right approach. I think the right approach, instead of having something, you know, unaligned that that like you're trying to prevent it from escaping, I think it's better to just design the model the right way or have a loop where you, you know, you look inside, you look inside the model and you're able to verify properties and that gives you an opportunity to like iterate and actually get it right. I think I think containing bad models is much worse solution than having good models. Let me ask about regulation. What's the role of regulation in keeping ASL safe? So for example, he described California AI regulation bill SB 1047 that was ultimately vetoed by the governor. What are the pros and cons of this bill? Yeah, we ended up making some suggestions to the bill and then some of those were adopted and, you know, we felt I think quite positively, quite positively about about the bill by the end of that. It did still have some downsides and, you know, of course, of course, you got vetoed. I think at a high level, I think some of the key ideas behind the bill are, you know, I would say similar to ideas behind our RSPs. And I think it's very important that some jurisdiction, whether it's California or the federal government and or other countries and other states passes some regulation like this. And I can talk through why I think that's so important. So I feel good about our RSP. It's not perfect. It needs to be iterated on a lot, but it's been a good forcing function for getting the company to take these risks seriously to put them into product planning, to really make them a central part of work and anthropic and to make sure that all of a thousand people and it's almost a thousand people now at an anthropic understand that this is one of the highest priorities of the company, if not the highest priority. But one, there are still some companies that don't have RSP like mechanisms like OpenAI, Google, did adopt these mechanisms a couple months after after andthropic did. But there are other companies out there that don't have these mechanisms at all. And so if some companies adopt these mechanisms and others don't, it's really going to create a situation where, you know, some of these dangers have the property that it doesn't matter if three out of five of the companies are being safe. If the other two are being are being unsafe, it creates this negative externality. And I think the lack of uniformity is not fair to those of us who have put a lot of effort into being very thoughtful about these procedures. The second thing is I don't think you can trust these companies to adhere to these voluntary plans in their own. Right. I like to think that anthropic will, we do everything we can that we will, our RSP is checked by our long-term benefit trust. So, you know, we do everything we can to to adhere to our own RSP. But, you know, you hear lots of things about various companies saying, oh, they said they would do, they said they would give this much compute and they didn't, they said they would do this thing and they didn't. You know, I don't think it makes sense to, you know, litigate particular things that companies have done. But I think this broad principle that like if there's nothing watching over them, there's nothing watching over us as an industry, there's no guarantee that we'll do the right thing and the stakes are very high. And so I think it's, I think it's important to have a uniform standard that that that that that everyone follows. And to make sure that simply that the industry does, what a majority of the industry has already said it is important and has already said that they definitely will do. Right. Some people, you know, I think there's there's a class of people who are against regulation on principle. I understand where that comes from. If you go to Europe and you know, you see something like GDPR, you see some of the other stuff that that that that that they've done, you know, some of it's good. But, but some of it is really unnecessarily burdensome. And I think it's fair to say really has slowed, really has slowed innovation. And so I understand where people are coming from on priors. I understand why people come from start from that, start from that position. But, but again, I think AI is different. If we go to the very serious risks of autonomy and misuse that that I talked about, you know, just a just a few minutes ago, I think that those are unusual and they warrant an unusually strong response. And so I think it's very important. Again, we need something that everyone can get behind. You know, I think one of the issues with SB 1047, especially the original version of it, was it had a bunch of the structure of RSPs. But it also had a bunch of stuff that was either a clunky or that that that just would have created a bunch of burdens, a bunch of hassle. And might even have missed the target in terms of addressing the risks. You don't really hear about it on Twitter. You just hear about kind of, you know, people are cheering for any regulation. And then the folks who are against make up these often quite intellectually dishonest arguments about how, you know, it'll make us move away from California, Bill doesn't apply if you're headquarter in California, Bill only applies if you do business in California. Or that it would damage the open source ecosystem, or that it would, you know, it would cause all of these things. I think those were mostly nonsense, but there are better arguments against regulation. There's one guy, Dean Ball, who's really, you know, I think a very scholarly analyst who looks at what happens when a regulation is put in place and ways that they can kind of get a life of their own or how they can be poorly designed. And so our interest has always been, we do think there should be regulation in this space. But we want to be an actor who makes sure that that, that that regulation is something that's surgical that's targeted at the serious risks. And it's something people can actually comply with. Because something I think the advocates of regulation don't understand as well as they could is if we get something in place that is that's poorly targeted, that waste a bunch of people's time. What's going to happen is people are going to say, see the safety risks there, you know, this is, this is nonsense. I just, you know, I just had to hire 10 lawyers to, you know, to fill out all these forums. I had to run all of these tests for something that was clearly not dangerous. And after six months of that, there will be, there will be a groundswell. And well, well, well, we'll end up with a durable consensus against regulation. And so the, I think the worst enemy of those who want real accountability is badly designed regulation. We need to actually get it right. And, and this is, if there's one thing I could say to the advocates, it would be that I want them to understand this dynamic better. And we need to be really careful. And we need to talk to people who actually have, who actually have experience seeing how regulations play out in practice. And, and the people who have seen that understand to be very careful. If this was some lesser issue, I might be against regulation at all. But what, what I want the opponents to understand is, is that the underlying issues are actually serious. They're, they're not, they're not something that I or the other companies are just making up because of regulatory capture. They're not sci-fi fantasies. They're not, they're not any of these things. You know, every, every time we have a new model, every few months, we measure the behavior of these models. And they're getting better and better at these concerning tasks, just as they are getting better and better at, you know, good, valuable, economically useful tasks. And so I, I, I, I would just love it if some of the former, you know, I think SB 1047 was very polarizing. I would love it if some of the most reasonable opponents and some of the most reasonable proponents would sit down together. And, you know, I think, I think that, you know, the different, the different AI companies, you know, and Thropic was the only AI company that, you know, felt positively in a very detailed way. I think Elon tweeted, tweeted briefly something positive. But, you know, some of the, some of the big ones like Google, OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft were, were pretty strong, staunchly against. So I would really like is if, you know, some of the key stakeholders, some of the, you know, most thoughtful proponents and some of the most thoughtful opponents would sit down and say, how do we solve this problem in a way that the proponents feel brings a real reduction in risk and that the opponents feel that it is not, it is not hampering the industry or hampering innovation any more necessary than it, than it, than it needs to. And, and I think for, for whatever reason, that things got too polarized and those two groups didn't get to sit down in the way that they should. And, and I feel, I feel urgency. I really think we need to do something in 2025. You know, if we get to the end of 2025 and we still done nothing about this, then I'm going to be worried. I'm not, I'm not worried yet because again, the risks aren't here yet, but, but I think time is running short. And come up with something surgically, you said. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. And we need to get, we need to get away from this, this intense, pro-safety versus intense anti-regulatory rhetoric. Right, it's turned into these these flame wars on Twitter. And nothing good is going to come with that. So there's a lot of curiosity about the different players in the game. One of the OGs is OpenAI. You have had several years of experience at OpenAI. What's your story in history there? Yeah, so I was at OpenAI for roughly five years. For the last, I think it was a couple years, you know, I was Vice President of Research there. Probably myself and Iliusuits Giver were the ones who, you know, really kind of set the set the research direction around 2016 or 2017. I first started to really believe in or at least confirm my belief in the scaling hypothesis when Ilius famously said to me, the thing you need to understand about these models is they just want to learn. The models just want to learn. And and again, sometimes there are these one sentences, these Zen cones that you hear them and you're like, ah, that explains everything. That explains like a thousand things that I've seen. And then, I, you know, I ever after I had this visualization my head of like you optimize the models in the right way. You point the models in the right way. They just want to learn. They just want to solve the problem. Regardless of what the problem is. So get out of their way, basically. Get out of their way. Yeah, don't impose your own ideas about how they should learn. And you know, this was the same thing as Rich Sutton put out in the bitter lesson or Gurn put out in the scaling hypothesis. You know, I think generally the dynamic was, you know, I got I got this kind of inspiration from from from from from Ilian from others folks like Alicrad, Fridge who did the the original G p t one. And then ran really hard with it. Me and my collaborators on GPT 2, GPT 3 are all from human feedback, which was an attempt to kind of deal with the early safety and durability. Things like debate and amplification, heavy on interpretability. So again, the combination of safety plus scaling probably 2018, 2019, 2020, those those were those were kind of the years when myself and my collaborators probably, you know, most many of whom became co-founders of anthropic kind of really had had a vision and like and like drove the direction. Why do you leave? Why just said to leave? Yeah. So look, I'm going to put things this way and I, you know, I think it ties to the race to the top, right, which is, you know, in my time at OpenAI, when I come to see as I come to appreciate the scaling hypothesis and as I come to appreciate kind of the importance of safety along with the scaling hypothesis. The first one, I think, you know, OpenAI was was getting was getting on board with. The second one in a way had always been part of OpenAI's messaging, but, you know, over many years of the time that I spent there, I think I had a particular vision of how these, how we should handle these things, how we should be brought out in the world, the kind of principles that the organization should have. And look, I mean, there were like many, many discussions about like, you know, should the or should the company do this, the company do that? Like, there's a bunch of misinformation out there. People say like, we left because we didn't like the deal with Microsoft. False, although, you know, it was like a lot of discussion, a lot of questions about exactly how we do the deal with Microsoft. We left because we didn't like commercialization. That's not true. We built GPD3, which was the model that was commercialized. I was involved in commercialization. It's, it's more again about how do you do it? Like, civilization is going down this path to very powerful AI. What's the way to do it that is cautious, straightforward, honest, that builds trust in the organization, and individuals, how do we get from here to there? And how do we have a real vision for how to get it right? How can safety not just be some thing we say because it helps with recruiting? And, you know, I think, I think at the end of the day, if you have a vision for that, forget about anyone else's vision. I don't want to talk about anyone else's vision, if you have a vision for how to do it, you should go off and you should do that vision. It is incredibly unproductive to try and argue with someone else's vision. You might think they're not doing it the right way. You might think they're, they're dishonest. Who knows, maybe you're right, maybe you're not. But what you should do is you should take some people you trust and you should go off together and you should make your vision happen. And if your vision is compelling, if you can make it appeal to people, some, you know, some combination of ethically, you know, in the market, you know, if you can, if you can make a company that's a place, people want to join, that, you know, engages in practices that people think are reasonable, while managing to maintain its position in the ecosystem at the same time, if you do that, people will copy it. And the fact that you were doing it, especially the fact that you're doing it better than they are, causes them to change their behavior in a much more compelling way than if they're your boss and you're arguing with them. I just, I don't know how to be any more specific about it than that. But I think it's generally very unproductive to try and get someone else's vision to look like your vision. It's much more productive to go off and do a clean experiment and say, this is our vision, this is how, this is how we're going to do things. Your choice is you can, you can ignore us, you can reject what we're doing, or you can, you can start to become more like us, and imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. And, you know, that, that, that plays out in the behavior of customers that pays out in the behavior of the public, that plays out in the behavior of where people choose to work. And again, again, at the end, it's, it's not about one company winning or another company winning. If we are another company or engaging in some practice that, you know, people find genuinely appealing. And I want it to be in substance, not just in appearance. And, you know, I think, I think researchers are sophisticated and they will get substance. And then other companies start copying that practice and they win because they copied that practice. That's great. That's success. That's like the race to the top. It doesn't matter who wins in the end as long as everyone is copying everyone else's good practices. Right? One way I think of it is like the thing we're all afraid of is the race to the bottom. Right? And the race to the bottom doesn't matter who wins because we all lose. Right? Like, you know, in the most extreme world, we make this autonomous AI that, you know, the robots and slave us or whatever. Right? I mean, that's half joking, but, you know, that, that is the most extreme thing that could happen. Then, then it doesn't matter which company was ahead. If instead, you create a race to the top where people are competing to engage in good, in good practices. Then, you know, at the end of the day, you know, it doesn't matter who ends up winning. It doesn't even matter who started the race to the top. The point isn't to be virtuous. The point is to get the system into a better equilibrium than it was before. And, and individual companies can play some role in doing this. Individual companies can, you know, can help to start it, can help to accelerate it. And frankly, I think individuals at other companies have done this as well. Right? The individuals that when we put out an RSP react by pushing harder to get something similar done, gets something similar done at at at other companies. Sometimes other companies do something that's like, we're like, oh, it's a good practice. We think, we think that's good. We should adopt it, too. The only difference is, you know, I think we are, um, we try to be more forward-bleaning. We try to adopt more of these practices first and adopt them more quickly when others invent them. But I think this dynamic is what we should be pointing at. And that I think I think it abstracts away the question of, you know, which companies winning, who trust who, I think all these, all these questions of drama are are profoundly uninteresting. And the thing that matters is the ecosystem that we all operate in and how to make that ecosystem better because that constrains all the players. And so, in Thropock is this kind of clean experiment built on a foundation of like what concretely AICT should look like. We're, look, I'm sure we've made plenty of mistakes along the way. The perfect organization doesn't exist. It has to deal with the, the imperfection of a thousand employees. It has to deal with the imperfection of our leaders, including me. It has to deal with the imperfection of the people we've put, we've put, you know, to oversee the imperfection of the, of the leaders like the, like the board and the long-term benefit trust. It's, it's all, it's all a set of imperfect people trying to aim imperfectly at some ideal that will never perfectly be achieved. That's what you sign up for. That's what it will always be. But imperfect doesn't mean you just give up. There's better and there's worse. And hopefully, hopefully we can begin to build, we can do well enough that we can begin to build some practices that the whole industry engages in. And then, you know, my guess is that multiple of these companies will be successful. And tropical will be successful. These other companies, like once I've been at the past, will also be successful. And some will be more successful than others. That's less important than again, that we, we align the incentives of the industry. And that happens partly through the race to the top, partly through things like RSP, partly through, again, selected surgical regulation. You said talent density beats talent mass. So can you explain that? Can you expand on that? Can you just talk about what it takes to build a great team of AI researchers and engineers? This is one of these statements that's like more true every, every, every month, every month. I see this statement as more true than I did the month before. So if I were to do with thought experiment, let's say you have a team of 100 people that are super smart, motivated in the line with the mission and that's your company. Or you can have a team of 1000 people where 200 people are super smart, super lined with the mission. And then like 800 people are let's just say you pick 800 like random, random, big tech employees. Which would you rather have? The talent mass is greater in the group of, in the group of 1000 people. You have even a larger number of incredibly talented, incredibly aligned, incredibly smart people. But the issue is just that if every time someone super talented looks around, they see someone else super talented and super dedicated, that sets the tone for everything. That sets the tone for everyone is super inspired to work at the same place. Everyone trusts everyone else. If you have a thousand or 10,000 people and things have really regressed, right? You are not able to do selection and you're choosing random people. What happens is then you need to put a lot of processes and a lot of guardrails in place. Just because people don't fully trust each other. You have to adjudicate political battles. Like there are so many things that slow down the org's ability to operate. And so we're nearly a thousand people. And you know, we've tried to make it so that as large a fraction of those thousand people as possible are like super talented, super skilled. It's one of the reasons we've we've slowed down hiring a lot in the last few months. We grew from 300 to 800, I believe. I think in the first seven, eight months of the year. And now we've slowed down. We're at like, you know, last three months, we went from 800 to 900 to 950, something like that. Don't quote me on the exact numbers. But I think there's an inflection point around the thousand and we want to be much more careful how we grow early on. And now as well, we've hired a lot of physicists. You know, theoretical physicists can learn things really fast. Even even more recently as we've continued to hire that, you know, we've really had a high bar for on both the research side and the software engineering side have hired a lot of senior people, including folks who used to be at other other companies in this space. And we just continued to be very selective. It's very easy to go from 100 to 1000 to 1000 to 10,000 without paying attention to making sure everyone has a unified purpose. It's so powerful. If your company consists of a lot of different freedoms that all want to do their own thing, they're all optimizing for their own thing. It's very hard to get anything done. But if everyone sees the broader purpose of the company, if there's trust and there's dedication to doing the right thing, that is a superpower. That in itself, I think can overcome almost every other disadvantage. And, you know, it's the Steve Jobs A players. A players want to look around and see other A players. There's another wave of saying, right. I don't know what that is about human nature, but it is demotivating to see people who are not obsessively driving towards a single emission. And it is on the flip side of that super motivating to see that. It's interesting. What's it take to be a great AI researcher or engineer from everything you've seen for work and with so many amazing people? Yeah. I think the number one quality, especially on the research side, but really both, is open-mindedness. Sound is easy to be open-minded. You're just like, oh, I'm open to anything. But, you know, if I think about my own early history in the scaling hypothesis, I was seeing the same data others were seen. I don't think I was like a better programmer or better at coming up with research ideas than any of the hundreds of people that I worked with. In some ways, in some ways, I was worse. I've never precise programming of finding the bug, writing the GPU kernels. I could point you to a hundred people here who are better, who are better at that than I am. But the thing that I think I did have that was different was that I was just willing to look at something with new eyes. People said, oh, you know, we don't have the right algorithms yet. We haven't come up with the right the right way to do things. I was just like, oh, I don't know. This neural net has like 30 billion, 30 million parameters. What if we gave it 50 million instead? Let's plot some graphs. Like that, that basic scientific mindset of like, oh man, like I just, I just like, I see some variable that I could change. What happens when it changes? Let's try these different things and create a graph. For even this, this was like the simplest thing in the world. Change the number of this wasn't like PhD level experimental design. This was like simple and stupid. Anyone could have done this if you just hold them that it was important. It's also not hard to understand. You didn't need to be brilliant to come up with this. But you put the two things together and, you know, some tiny number of people, some single digit number of people have driven forward the whole field by realizing this. And it's you know, it's often like that if you look back at the discovery, you know, the discoveries in history, they're they're often like that. And so this this opened mindedness and this willingness to see with new eyes that often comes from being newer to the field. Often experience is a disadvantage for this. That is the most important thing. It's very hard to look for and test for. But I think I think it's the most important thing because when you when you find something some really new way of thinking thinking about things, when you have the initiative to do that, it's absolutely transformative. And also be able to do kind of rapid experimentation and in the face of that be open minded and curious and looking at the data for these fresh eyes and seeing what is that it's actually saying that applies in a mechanism to interpret ability. It's another example of this. Like some of the early work in back-and-est to interpret ability, so simple. It's just no one thought to care about this question before. You said what it takes to be a great air research. Can we rewind the clock back? What advice would you give to people interested in AI? They're young looking forward to how can I make an impact on the world? I think my number one piece of advice is to just start playing with the models. This was actually, I worry a little this seems like obvious advice. Now, I think three years ago, it wasn't obvious and people started by, oh, let me read the latest reinforcement learning paper. No, that was really the, that was really the, and I mean, you should do that as well. But now with wider availability of models and APIs, people are doing this more. But I think I think just experiential knowledge. These models are new artifacts that no one really understands. And so getting experience playing with them. I would also say again in line with the like, do something new, thinking some new direction. Like, there are all these things that haven't been explored. Like, for example, mechanistic interpretability is still very new. It's probably better to work on that than it is to work on new model architectures because it's, you know, it's more popular than it was before. There are probably like 100 people working on it. But there aren't like 10,000 people working on it. And it's this fertile area for study. Like, like, you know, there's, there's so much like low-hanging fruit. You can just walk by and, you know, you can just walk by and you can pick things. And the only reason for whatever reason people aren't interested in it enough, I think there are some things around long horizon learning and long horizon tasks where there's a lot to be done. I think evaluations are still, we're still very early in our ability to study evaluations, particularly for dynamic systems, acting in the world. I think there's some stuff around multi-agent. Skate where the puck is going is my advice. And you don't have to be brilliant to think of it. Like, all the things that are going to be exciting in five years, like, and people even mentioned them as like, you know, conventional wisdom. But like, it's just somehow there's this barrier that people don't people don't double down as much as they could or they're afraid to do something that's not the popular thing. I don't know why it happens, but like getting over that barrier. That's the my number one piece of advice. Let's talk if it could a bit about post-training. Yeah. So it seems that the modern post-training recipe has a little bit of everything. So supervised fine tuning, RLA-ChF, the constitutional AI was RL-A-I-F. That's dr. And it's the again that naming thing. And then synthetic data seems like a lot of synthetic data or at least trying to figure out ways to have high quality synthetic data. What's the, if this is a secret sauce that makes anthropic cloth so incredible? How much of the magic is in the pre-training? How much is in the post-training? Yeah. I mean, so first of all, we're not perfectly able to measure that ourselves. When you see some great character ability, sometimes it's hard to tell whether it came from pre-training or post-training. We've developed ways to try and distinguish between those two, but they're not perfect. The second thing I would say is, when there isn't advantage and I think we've been pretty good in general, in general at RL, perhaps, perhaps the best, although I don't know because I don't see what goes on inside other companies. Usually it isn't, oh my god, we have this secret magic method that others don't have. Usually it's like, well, we got better at the infrastructure so we could run it for longer or you're able to get higher quality data or we were able to filter our data better or we were able to combine these methods and practice. It's usually some boring matter of kind of practice and trade craft. When I think about how to do something special in terms of how we train these models, both pre-training but even more so post-training, I really think of it a little more again as designing airplanes or cars. It's not just like, oh man, I have the blueprint. Maybe that makes you make the next airplane but like there's some cultural trade craft of how we think about the design process that I think is more important than any particular gizmo or able to invent. Okay, well, let me ask about specific techniques. First on RLHF, what do you think just zooming out into asian, almost philosophy? What do you think RLHF works so well? If I go back to the scaling hypothesis, one of the ways to skate the scaling hypothesis is if you train for X and you throw enough compute at it, then you get X. And so RLHF is good at doing what humans want the model to do or at least to state it more precisely doing what humans who look at the model for a brief period of time and consider different possible responses what they prefer as the response, which is not perfect from both the safety and capabilities perspective. In that humans are often not able to perfectly identify what the model wants and what humans want in the moment may not be what they want in the long term. So there's a lot of subtlety there, but the models are good at producing what the humans and some shallow sense want. And it actually turns out that you don't even have to throw that much compute at it because of another thing, which is this thing about a strong pre-trained model being halfway anywhere. So once you have the pre-trained model, you have all the representations you need to get the model to get the model where you want it to go. So do you think our RLHF makes the model smarter or just appears smarter to the humans? I don't think it makes the model smarter. I don't think it just makes the model appear smarter. It's like RLHF like bridges the gap between the human and the model. Right, I could have something really smart that can't communicate at all. We all know people like this. People who are really smart, but you can't understand what they're saying. So I think RLHF just bridges that gap. I think it's not the only kind of RL we do. It's not the only kind of RL that will happen in the future. I think RL has the potential to make model smarter, to make them reasoned better, to make them operate better, to develop new skills even. And perhaps that could be done, you know, even in some cases with human feedback. But the kind of RLHF we do today, mostly doesn't do that yet. Although we're very quickly starting to be able to, but it appears to sort of increase if you look at the metric of healthfulness. It increases that. It also increases. What was this word in Leopold's essay? Unhovelling? Or basically the models are hobbled. And then you do various trainings to them to unhovele them. So I like that word because it's like a RLHF so I think RLHF unhoveles the models in some ways. And then there are other ways where model hasn't yet been unhovable and needs done. If you can say, in terms of costs, it's pre-training the most expensive thing or is post-training, creep up to that. At the present moment, it is still the case that pre-training is the majority of the cost. I don't know what to expect in the future, but I could certainly anticipate a future where post-training is the majority of the cost. In that future you anticipate would it be the humans or the AI that's the cost they think for the post-training? I don't think you can scale up humans enough to get high quality. Any kind of method that relies on humans and uses a large amount of compute, it's going to have to rely on some scaled supervision method like debate or iterated amplification or something like that. So on that, super interesting set of ideas around constitutional AI can describe what it is as first detailed into summer 2020. Yes, two paper and beyond that. What is it? Yes, so this was from two years ago. The basic idea is, so we describe what RLHF is, you have model and spits out two p, you know, like you just sample from it twice, spits out two possible responses and you're like human, which responds to do like better or another variant of it is rate this response on scale of 1 to 7. So that's hard because you need to scale up human interaction and it's very implicit. I don't have a sense of what I want the model to do. I just have a sense of like what this average of a thousand humans wants the model to do. So two ideas, one is, could the AI system itself decide which response is better? Could you show the AI system these two responses and ask which response is better and then second, well, what criterion should the AI use? And so then there's this idea, could you have a single document, a constitution, if you will, that says these are the principles the model should be using to respond and the AI system reads those, it reads those principles as well as reading the environment and the response and it says, well, how good did the AI model do? It's basically a form of self-play. You're kind of training the model against itself. And so the AI gives the response and then you feed that back into what's called the preference model which in turn feeds the model to make it better. So you have this triangle of like the AI, the preference model, and the improvement of the AI itself. And we should say that in the constitution, the set of principles are like human interpretable. They're like, yeah, yeah, it's something both the human and the AI system can read. So it has this nice, this nice kind of translatable idea or symmetry. In practice, we both use a model constitution and we use RLHF and we use some of these other methods. So it's turned into one tool in a tool kit that both reduces the need for RLHF and increases the value we get from using each data point of RLHF. It also interacts in interesting ways with kind of future reasoning type RL methods. So it's one tool in the tool kit, but I think it is a very important tool. But it's a compelling one to us humans, you know, think about the foundy fathers and the foundy of the United States. The natural question is, who and how do you think it gets to define the constitution, the set of principles in the constitution? Yeah, so I'll give like a practical answer and a more abstract answer. I think the practical answer is like, look, in practice models get used by all kinds of different like customers, right? And so you can have this idea where you know, the model can have specialized rules or principles, you know, we find two inversions of models. And implicitly, we've talked about doing it explicitly, having having special principles that people can build into the models. So from a practical perspective, the answer can be very different from different people, you know, customer service agent, you know, behaves very differently from the lawyer and obeys different principles. But I think at the base of it, there are specific principles that models, you know, have to obey. I think a lot of them are things that people would agree with. Everyone agrees that, you know, we don't, you know, we don't want models to present these CBRN risks. I think we can go a little further and agree with some basic principles of democracy and the rule of law. Beyond that, it gets, you know, very uncertain. And there are goals generally for the models to be more neutral to not a spouse, the particular point of view. And, you know, more just be kind of like wise agents or advisors that will help you think things through. And will, you know, present, present possible considerations, but, you know, don't express, you know, strong or specific opinions. Open AI released a model spec where kind of clearly concretely defines some of the goals of the model and specific examples like AB, how the model should behave. Do you find that interesting? By the way, I should mention the, I believe the brilliant John Schumann was a part of that. He's not an anthropic. Do you think this is useful direction? My anthropic release a model spec as well? Yeah. So I think that's a pretty useful direction. Again, it has a lot in common with constitutional AI. So again, another example of like a race to the top, right? We have something that's like we think, you know, a better and more responsible way of doing things. It's also a competitive advantage. Then others kind of, you know, discover that it has advantages. And then start to do that thing. We that no longer have the competitive advantage, but it's good from the perspective that now everyone has adopted a positive practice that others were not adopting. And so our response to that as well looks like we need a new competitive advantage in order to keep driving this race upwards. So that's, that's how I generally feel about that I also think every implementation of these things is different. So, you know, there were some things in the model spec that were not in constitutional AI. And so, you know, we, you know, we can always, we can always adopt those things or, you know, at least learn from them. So again, I think this is an example of like the positive dynamic that that that that that I that I think we should all want to feel to have. Let's talk about the incredible essay. Machines 11. Grace, I recommend everybody read it. It's a long one. It is rather long. Yeah. It's really refreshing to re concrete ideas about what a positive future looks like. And you took sort of a bold stance because like it's very possible that you might be wrong on the dates or specific. Oh, yeah, I'm fully expecting to, you know, to definitely be wrong about all the details. I might be just spectacularly wrong about the whole thing and people will, you know, we'll laugh at me for years. That's, that's that's just how the future works. So you provided a bunch of concrete positive impacts of AI and how, you know, exactly a super intelligent AI might accelerate the rate of breakthroughs. And for example, biology and chemistry that would then lead to things like we cure most cancers, prevent all infectious disease, double the human lifespan and so on. So let's talk about the essay first. Can you give a high level vision of the essay and what key takeaways that people have? Yeah, I have spent a lot of time in Anthropica. I spent a lot of effort on like, you know, how do we address the risks of AI? Right? How do we think about those risks? Like, we're trying to do a race to the top, you know, what that requires us to build all these capabilities and the capabilities are cool. But, you know, we're, we're like a big part of what we're trying to do is like address the risks. And then just a vacation for that is like, well, you know, all these positive things, you know, the market is this very healthy organism, right? It's going to produce all the positive things. The risks, I don't know, we might mitigate them. We might not. And so we can have more impact by trying to mitigate the risks. But I noticed that one flaw in that way of thinking and it's, it's not a change in how serious light takes the risks. It's, it's maybe a change in how I talk about them. Is that, you know, no matter how kind of logical or rational that line of reasoning that I just gave might be, if, if you kind of only talk about risks, your brain only thinks about risks. And, and so I think it's actually very important to understand what if things do go well. And the whole reason we're trying to prevent these risks is not because we're afraid of technology, not because we want to slow it down. It's, it's, it's because if we can get to the other side of these risks, right? If we can run the gauntlet successfully, you know, to put it in stark terms, then, then on the other side of the gauntlet are all these great things. And these things are worth fighting for. And these things can really inspire people. And I think I imagine because, look, you have all these investors, all these VCs, all these AI companies talking about all the positive benefits of AI. But as you point out, it's, it's, it's weird. There's actually a Earth of really getting specific about it. There's a lot of like random people on Twitter like posting these kind of like gleaming cities and this, this just kind of like vibe of like grind, accelerate harder, like kick out the diesel. You know, it's, it's just this very, this very, like aggressive ideological. But then you're like, well, what are you, what, what, are you actually excited about? And so, and so I figured that, you know, I think it would be interesting and valuable for someone who's actually coming from the risk side to try and, and to try and really make a try at at explaining, explaining what the benefits are. Both because I think it's something we can all get behind. And I want people to understand. I want them to really understand that this isn't, this isn't Dumer's versus accelerationists. This, this is that if you have a true understanding of where things are going with with AI and maybe that's the more important access. AI is moving fast versus AI is not moving fast. Then you really appreciate the benefits and you, you, you, you, you, you, you really you want humanity. Our civilization disease, those benefits. But you also get very serious about anything that could derail them. So I think the starting point is to talk about what this powerfully I, which is the term you like to use most of the world uses, AGI, but you don't like the term because it's basically has too much baggage. It's become meaningless. It's like we're stuck with the terms. I really really like it. Maybe we're stuck with the terms and my efforts to change them are futile. It's admirable. I'll tell you what else I don't, this is like a pointless semantic point. But I, yeah, I keep talking about it. I just didn't do it once more. I think it's, it's a little like, like let's say it was like 1995 and Moore's laws making the computers faster. And like for some reason there, there, there had been this like verbal tick that like, everyone was like, well, someday we're going to have like super computers. And like super computers are going to be able to do all these things that like, you know, once we have super computers, we'll be able to like sequence that you know, and we'll be able to do other things. And so, and so like one, it's true, the computers are getting faster and as they get faster, they're going to be able to do all these great things. But there's like, there's no discrete point at which you had a super computer and previous computers were not to like, super computers at term we use. But like, it's a vague term to just describe like computers that are faster than what we have today. There's no point at which you pass the threshold and you're like, oh my god, we're doing a totally new type of computation and new. And so I feel that way about AGI. Like, there's just a smooth exponential. And like, if by AGI, you mean like, like, AGI is getting better and better and like gradually it's going to do more and more of what humans do and told it's going to be smarter than humans. And then it's going to get smarter even from there than then yes, I believe in AGI. But if if AGI is some discrete or separate thing, which is the way people often talk about it, then it's kind of a meaningless buzzword. Yeah, to me, it's just sort of a platonic form of a powerful AI exactly how you define it. I mean, you just find it very nicely. On the intelligence axis, it's just on pure intelligence. It's smarter than a Nobel Prize winner as you describe across most relevant disciplines. So, okay, that's just intelligence. So, it's both in creativity and being able to generate new ideas, all that kind of stuff in every discipline, Nobel Prize winner. Okay, in their prime. It can use every modality. So, this kind of self-explanatory, but just operate across all the modalities of the world. It can go off for many hours, days and weeks to do tasks and do its own sort of detailed planning and only ask you help when it's needed. It can use, this is actually kind of interesting. I think in the S, you said, I mean, again, it's a bet that's not going to be embodied, but it can control embodied tools. So, it can control tools, robots, laboratory equipment. The resource used to train it can then be repurposed to run millions of copies of it. And each of those copies would be independent that can do their own independent work. So, you can do the cloning of the intelligence. Yes, I mean, you might imagine from outside the field that there's only one of these, right? You made it, you've only made one. But the truth is that like the scale up is very quick. Like we do this today. We make a model, and then we deploy thousands, maybe tens of thousands of instances of it. I think by the time, certainly within two to three years, whether we have these super powerful AIs or not, clusters are going to get to the size where you'll be able to deploy millions of these. And they'll be faster than humans. And so, if your picture is all, we'll have one, and then it'll take a while to make them my point there was no, actually you have millions of them right away. And in general, they can learn and act 10 to 100 times faster than humans. So, that's a really nice definition of powerful AI. Okay, so that, but you also write that clearly such an entity would be capable of solving very difficult problems very fast. But it is not trivial to figure out how fast. Two extreme positions both seem false to me. So, the singularity is on the one extreme, and the opposite and the other extreme. Can you describe each of the extremes? Yeah, and why? So, yeah, let's describe the extreme. So, like one extreme would be, well, look. You know, if we look at kind of evolutionary history, like there was this big acceleration, where, you know, for hundreds of thousands of years, we just had like, you know, single-cell organisms, and then we had mammals, and then we had apes, and then that quickly turned to humans. Humans quickly built industrial civilization. And so, this is going to keep speeding up. And there's no ceiling at the human level. Once models get much, much smarter than humans, they'll get really good at building the next models. And, you know, if you write down like a simple differential equation, like this is an exponential. And so, what's, what's going to happen is that models will build faster models, models will build faster models. And those models will build, you know, nano-bots that can like take over the world and produce much more energy than you could produce otherwise. And so, if you just kind of like solve this abstract differential equation, then like five days after we, you know, we build the first AI that's more powerful than humans, then, you know, like the world will be filled with these AIs in every possible technology that could be invented, like, will be invented. I'm caricaturing this a little bit. But, you know, I think that's one extreme. And the reason that I think that's not the case is that one, I think they just neglect like the laws of physics, like it's only possible to do things so fast in the physical world. Like some of those loops go through, you know, producing faster hardware, takes a long time to produce faster hardware, things take a long time. There's this issue of complexity. Like, I think no matter how smart you are, like, you know, people talk about, oh, we can make models of biological systems that will do everything the biological systems. Well, I think computational modeling can do a lot. I get a lot of computational modeling when I worked in biology, but like, just there are a lot of things that you can't predict how they're, you know, they're complex enough that like just iterating, just running the experiment is going to beat any modeling, no matter how smart the system doing the modeling is. Well, even if it's not interacting with a physical world, just the modeling is going to be hard. Yeah, I think, well, the modeling is going to be hard in getting the model to match the physical world is going to be, all right, so it does have to interact with the model. Yeah, yeah, but it's just, you know, you just look at even the simplest problems, like, you know, if they talk about like, you know, the three body problem or simple chaotic prediction, like, you know, or like predicting the economy. It's really hard to predict the economy two years out. Like, maybe the case is like, you know, normal, you know, humans can predict what's going to happen in the economy next quarter. They can't really do that. Maybe a AI system that's, you know, a zillion times smarter can only predict it out a year or something. Instead of, you know, you have these kind of exponential increase in computer intelligence for linear increase in, in, in ability to predict. Same with, again, like, you know, biological molecules, molecules interacting, you don't know what's going to happen when you perturb, but when you perturb a complex system, you can find simple parts in it. If you're smarter, you're better at finding these simple parts. And then I think human institutions, human institutions are just, are really difficult. Like, it's, you know, it's, it's been hard to get people. I won't give specific examples, but it's been hard to get people to adopt even the technologies that we've developed, even ones where the case for their efficacy is very, very strong. You know, people have concerns. They think things are conspiracy theories. Like, it's just been, it's been very difficult. It's also been very difficult to get, you know, very simple things through the regulatory system. Right? I think, you know, and, you know, I don't want to disparage anyone who, you know, you know, works in regulatory, regulatory systems of any technology. They're hard tradeoffs. They have to deal with. They have to save lives. But, but the system as a whole, I think, makes some obvious tradeoffs that are very far from maximizing human welfare. And so if we bring AI systems into this, you know, into these human systems, often the level of intelligence may just not be the limiting factor. Right? It, it just may be that it takes a long time to do something. Now, if the AI system circumvented all governments, if it just said I'm dictator of the world and I'm going to do whatever, some of these things that could do. Again, the things have you do with complexity. I still think a lot of things would take a while. I don't think it helps that the AI systems can produce a lot of energy or go to the moon, like some people in comments responded to the essay saying the AI system can produce a lot of energy and smarter AI systems. That's missing the point. That kind of cycle doesn't solve the key problems that I'm talking about here. So I think I think a bunch of people miss the point there. But even if it were completely online and, you know, could get around all these human obstacles that would have trouble. But again, if you want this to be an AI system that doesn't take over the world, that doesn't destroy humanity, then basically, you know, it's going to need to follow basic human laws. Right? If we want to have an actually good world, like we're going to have to have an AI system that interacts with humans, not one that kind of creates its own legal system or disregard all the laws or all of that. So as inefficient as these processes are, we're going to have to deal with them because there needs to be some popular and democratic legitimacy in how these systems are rolled out. We can't have a small group of people who are developing these systems say this is what's best for everyone. Right? I think it's wrong and I think in practice is not going to work anyway. So you put all those things together and, you know, we're not going to change the world and upload everyone in five minutes. I just, I don't think AI, AI, I don't think it's going to happen and be to, to the extent that it could happen, it's, it's not the way to lead to a good world. So that's on one side. On the other side, there's another set of perspectives, which I have actually in some ways more sympathy for, which is look, we've seen big productivity increases before, right? You know, economists are familiar with studying the productivity increases that came from the computer revolution and internet revolution and generally those productivity increases were underwhelming. They were less than you, then you might imagine. There was a quote from Robert Solo, you see the computer revolution everywhere except the productivity statistics. So why is this the case? People point to the structure of firms, the structure of enterprises, how, you know, how slow it's been to roll out or existing technology to very poor parts of the world, which I talk about in the essay, right? How do we get these technologies to the poorest parts of the world that are behind on cell phone technology, computers, medicine, let alone, you know, new fangle day eye that hasn't been invented yet. So you could have a perspective that's like, well, this is amazing technically, but it's all enough in burger. You know, I think Tyler Cowen, who wrote something response to my essay, has that perspective. I think he thinks the radical change will happen eventually, but he thinks it'll take 50 or 100 years. And you could have even more static perspectives on the whole thing. I think there's some truth to it. I think the time scale is just too long. And I can see it. I can actually see both sides with today's AI. So, you know, a lot of our customers are large enterprises who are used to doing things a certain way. I've also seen it in talking to governments, right? Those are, those are prototypical, you know, institutions, entities that are slow to change. But the dynamic I see over and over again is, yes, it takes a long time to move the ship. Yes, there's a lot of resistance and lack of understanding, but the thing that makes me feel that progress will in the end happen moderately fast, not incredibly fast, but moderately fast, is that you talk to what I find is I find over and over again, again, in large companies, even in governments, which have been actually surprisingly forward leaning. You find two things that move things forward. One, you find a small fraction of people within a company within a government who really see the big picture, who see the whole scaling hypothesis, who understand where AI is going, or at least understand where it's going within their industry. And there are a few people like that within the current, within the current US government who really see the whole picture. And, and those people see that this is the most important thing in the world until they agitate for it. And the thing that they alone are not enough to succeed because they're a small set of people within a large organization. But as the technology starts to roll out, as it succeeds in some places, in the folks who are most willing to adopt it, the specter of competition gives them a wind at their backs because they can point within their large organization. They can say, look, these other guys are doing this, right? You know, one bank can say, look, this newfangled hedge fund is doing this thing. They're going to eat our lunch. In the US, we can say, we're afraid China's going to get there before we are. And that combination, the specter of competition, plus a few visionaries within these, you know, within these, the organizations that in many ways are are sclerotic, you put those two things together and it actually makes something happen. I mean, it's interesting. It's a balance fight between the two because inertia is very powerful. But, but, but eventually, over enough time, the innovative approach breaks through. And I've seen that happen. I've seen the arc of that over and over again. And it's like the barriers are there. The barriers to progress, the complexity, not knowing how to use the model, how to deploy them are there. And for a bit, it seems like they're going to last forever. Like change doesn't happen. But then eventually change happens and always comes from a few people. I felt the same way when I was an advocate of the scaling hypothesis within the AI field itself, and others didn't get it. It felt like no one would ever get it. It felt like, then it felt like we had a secret almost no one ever had. And then a couple years later, everyone has the secret. And so I think that's how it's going to go with deployment to AI in the world. It's going to, the barriers are going to fall apart gradually and then all at once. And so I think this is going to be more. And this is just an instinct. I could easily see how I'm wrong. I think it's going to be more like 10, 5 or 10 years, as I say in the essay, then it's going to be 50 or 100 years. I also think it's going to be 5 or 10 years more than it's going to be, you know, 5 or 10 hours. Because I just seen how human systems work. And I think a lot of these people who write down me differential equations who say AI is going to make more powerful AI who can't understand how it could possibly be the case that these things won't change so fast. I think they don't understand these things. So what do you use the timeline to where we achieve AGI, aka powerful AI, aka super useful AI? I'm just going to start calling with that. It's a debate about naming. You know, on pure intelligence, it can smarter than a Nobel Prize winner and every relevant discipline and all the things we've said. Modality can go and do stuff on its own for days, weeks, and do biology experiments on its own. You know what? Let's just tick to biology. Because yeah, I would use sold me on the whole biology and health section. It's so exciting from just, I was getting getting from a scientific perspective and maybe you want to be a biologist. Almost. So, no, no, this was the feeling I have when I was writing it, that it's like, this would be such a beautiful future. If we can, if we can just, if we can just make it happen, right? If we can just get the, get the landmines out of the way and, and make it happen, there's, there's so much, there's so much beauty and, and, and, and, and elegance and moral force behind it if we can, if we can, if we can just, and it's something we should all be able to agree on, right? Like, as much as we fight about about all these political questions, is, is this something that could actually bring us together? But you were asking when, when, when, when, when do you think, what's just so, but numbers on this? So, you know, this, this is, of course, the thing I've been grappling with for many years and I'm not, I'm not at all confident. Every time, if I say 2026 or 2027, there will be like a zillion like people on Twitter who will be like, A, I see, oh, said 2026, 2027, and it will be repeated for like the next two years that like, this is definitely when I think it's going to happen. So, whoever's ex sort of these clips will, will, will, will crop out the thing I just said and, and, and only say the thing I'm about to say, but I'll just say it anyway. That's fine. So, so, if you extrapolate the curves that we've had so far, right? If, if you say, well, I don't know, we're starting to get to like PhD level and, and last year we were at under graduate level and the year before we were at like the level of a high school student. Again, you can, you can, you can quibble with at what tasks and for what, we're still missing modalities, but those are being added. Like computer use was added. Like image in was added. Like image generation has been added. If you just kind of like, and this is totally unscientific, but if you just kind of like eyeball the rate at which these capabilities are increasing, it does make you think that we'll get there by 2026 or 2027. Again, lots of things could derail it. We could run out of data. You know, we might not be able to scale clusters as much as we want. Like, you know, maybe Taiwan gets blown up or something and, you know, then we can't produce as many GPUs as we want. So there are, there are all kinds of things that could derail the whole process. So I don't fully believe the straight line extrapolation, but if you believe the straight line extrapolation, you'll, you'll, we'll get there in 2026 or 2027. I think the most likely is that there's some mild delay relative to that. I don't know what that delay is, but I think it could happen on schedule. I think there could be a mild delay. I think there are still worlds where it doesn't happen in a hundred years. Those worlds, the number of those worlds is rapidly decreasing. We are rapidly running out of truly convincing brocclers, truly compelling reasons why this will not happen in the next few years. There were a lot more in 2020. Although my, my guess, my hunch at that time was that we'll make it through all those blockers. So sitting as someone who has seen most of the blockers clear out of the way, I kind of suspect my hunch, my suspicion is that the rest of them will not block us. But, you know, look, look, look, look at the end of the day like I don't want to represent this as a scientific prediction. People call them scaling laws. That's a misnomer. Like Moore's law is, is, is a misnomer. Moore's law is scaling laws. They're not laws of the universe. They're empirical regularities. I am going to bat in favor of them continuing, but I'm not certain of that. So you extensively describe sort of the compressed 21st century how AGI will help set forth a chain of breakthroughs in biology and medicine that help us in all these kinds of ways that I mentioned. So how do you think, what are the early steps in my due? And by the way, ask Claude, good questions to ask you about the, and Claude told me, task, would you think is a typical day for biologists working on AGI look like under in this future? Yeah. Yeah. A lot is curious. Let me, well, let me start with your first questions and then I'll answer that. Claude wants to know what's in its future, right? Exactly. Who might get it be working with? Exactly. So I think one of the things I went hard on, and when I went hard on in the essay is, let me go back to this idea of because it's really had it had an impact on me. This idea that within large organizations and systems, they're end up being a few people or a few new ideas who kind of cause things to go in a different direction they would have before, who kind of disproportionately affect the trajectory. There's a bunch of kind of the same thing going on, right? If you think about the health world, there's like, you know, trillions of dollars to pay out Medicare and, you know, other health insurance, and then the NIH is 100 billion. And then if I think of like the few things that have really revolutionized anything, it could be encapsulated in a small small fraction of that. And so when I think of like where will AI have an impact? I'm like, can AI turn that small fraction into a much larger fraction and raise its quality? And within biology, my experience within biology is that the biggest problem of biology is that you can't see what's going on. You have very little ability to see what's going on and even less ability to change it, right? What you have is this, like, like, from this, you have to infer that there's a bunch of cells that within each cell is, you know, a three billion base pairs of DNA built according to a genetic code. And, you know, there are all these processes that are just going on without any ability of us as, you know, unogmented humans to affect it. These cells are dividing most of the time that's healthy, but sometimes that process goes wrong and that's cancer. The cells are aging. Your skin may change color, develop wrinkles as you as you age. And all of this is determined by these processes. All these proteins being produced, transported to various parts of the cells, binding to each other. And in our initial state about biology, we didn't even know that these cells existed. We had to invent microscopes to observe the cells. We had to, we had to invent more powerful microscopes to see, you know, below the level of the cells, the level of molecules. We had to invent x-ray crystal logography to see the DNA. We had to invent gene sequencing to read the DNA. Now, you know, we had to invent protein-folding technology to, you know, to predict how it would fold and how they find, how these things bind to each other. You know, we had to, we had to invent various techniques for now. We can edit the DNA as of, you know, with CRISPR as of the last 12 years. So the whole history of biology, a whole big part of the history is basically our ability to read and understand what's going on and our ability to reach in and selectively change things. And my view is that there's so much more we can still do there, right? You can do CRISPR, but you can do it for your whole body. Let's say I want to do it for one particular type of cell and I want the rate of targeting the wrong cell to be very low. That's still a challenge. That's still things people are working on. That's what we might need for gene therapy for certain diseases. And so the reason I'm saying all of this and it goes beyond, you know, beyond this to, you know, to gene sequencing to new types of nano materials for observing what's going on inside cells for, you know, antibody drug conjugates. The reason I'm saying all of this is that this could be a leverage point for the AI systems, right? That the number of such inventions, it's in the mid double digits or something, you know, mid double digits, maybe low triple digits over the history of biology. Let's say I have a million of these AIs like, you know, can they discover a thousand, you know, working together, can they discover thousands of these very quickly? And does that provide a huge lever instead of trying to leverage the, you know, two trillion a year we spend on, you know, Medicare or whatever, can we leverage the one billion a year that's, you know, that's spent to discover, but with much higher quality. And so what, what is it like, you know, being a scientist that works with, with an AI system, the way I think about it actually is, well, so I think in the early stages, the AIs are going to be like grad students. You're going to give them a project. You're going to say, you know, I'm the experienced biologist. I've set up the lab, the biology professor, or even the grad students themselves, we'll say, here's what, here's what you can do with an AI, you know, like AI system. I'd like to study this and, you know, the AI system it has all the tools. It can like look up all the literature to decide what to do. It can look at all the equipment. It can go to a website and say, hey, I'm going to go to, you know, thermo-fisher or, you know, whatever the lab equipment company is, the lab equipment company is today and my, my time was thermo-fisher. You know, I'm, I'm going to order this new equipment to do this. I'm going to run my experiments. I'm going to, you know, write up a report about my experiments. I'm going to, you know, inspect the images for contamination. I'm going to decide what the next experiment is. I'm going to like write some code and run a statistical analysis. All the things that grad students would do that will be a computer with an AI that like the professor talks to everyone's to while and it says, is what you're going to do today. The AI system comes to it with questions. When it's necessary to run the lab equipment, it may be limited in some ways. It may have to hire a human lab assistant to, you know, to do the experiment and explain how to do it or it could, you know, it could use advances in lab automation that are gradually being developed over, you have been developed over the last decade or so and will, will continue to be, will continue to be developed. And so it'll look like there's a human professor in a thousand AI grad students and, you know, if you, if you go to one of these Nobel Prize winning biologists or so, you'll say, okay, well, you know, you had like 50 grad students. Well, now you have a thousand and they're smarter than you are, by the way. Then I think at some point it'll flip around where the, you know, the AI systems will, you know, will be the PIs, will be the leaders and, and, you know, they'll be, they'll be ordering humans or other AI systems around. So I think that's how it'll work on the research side and they would be the inventors of a CRISPR type technique. They would be the inventors of a CRISPR type technology. And then I think, you know, as I say in the essay, we'll want to turn, turn, probably turning loose as the wrong turn, but we'll want to, we'll want to harness the AI systems to improve the clinical trial system as well. There's some amount of this that's regulatory that's a matter of societal decisions and that'll be harder, but can we get better at predicting the results of clinical trials? Can we get better at statistical design so that what, you know, clinical trials that used to require, you know, 5,000 people and therefore, you know, needed $100 million in the year to enroll them. Now they need 500 people and two months to enroll them. That's where we should start. And, you know, can we increase the success rate of clinical trials by doing things and animal trials that we used to do in clinical trials and doing things and simulations that we used to do in animal trials again, we won't be able to simulate it all AI's not God, but, you know, can we shift the curve substantially and radically? So, I don't know, that would be my picture doing an in vitro and doing it. I mean, you still slow down, it still takes time, but you can do much, much faster. Yeah, yeah, can we just one step at a time and can that add up to a lot of steps, even though even though we still need clinical trials, even though we still need laws, even though the FDA and other organizations will still not be perfect, can we just move everything in a positive direction? And when you add up all those positive directions, do you get everything that was going to happen from here to 2100 instead of happens from 2027 to 2032 or something? Another way that I think the world might be changing with AI even today, but moving towards this future of the the powerful super useful AI is programming. So, how do you see the nature of programming because it's so intimate to the actual act of building AI? How do you see that changing for us humans? I think that's going to be one of the areas that changes fastest for two reasons. One, programming is a skill that's very close to the actual building of the AI. So, the farther a skill is from the people who are building the AI, the longer it's going to take to get disrupted by the AI, right? Like I truly believe that AI will disrupt agriculture. Maybe it already has in some ways, but that's just very distant from the folks who are building AI and so I think it's going to take longer. But programming is the bread and butter of, you know, a large fraction of employees who work at Anthropic and at the other companies. And so it's going to happen fast. The other reason it's going to happen fast is with programming you close the loop. Both when you're trained in the model, when you're applying the model, the idea that the model can write the code means that the model can then run the code and then see the results and interpret it back. And so it really has a ability, unlike hardware, unlike biology, which we just discussed. The model has an ability to close the loop. And so I think those two things are going to lead to the model getting good at programming very fast. As I saw on, you know, typical real-world programming models have gone from 3% in January of this year to 50% in October of this year. So, you know, we're on that S curve, right? We're going to start slowing down soon because you can only get to 100%. But, you know, I would guess that in another 10 months, we'll probably get pretty close. We'll be at at least 90%. So again, I would guess, you know, I don't know how long it'll take, but I would guess again, 2026, 2027, Twitter people who crop out my, who crop out these these numbers and get rid of the caveats, like, like, I don't know, I don't like you go away. I would guess that the kind of task that the vast majority of coders do, AI can probably, if we make the task very narrow, like just right code, AI systems will be able to do that. Now, that said, I think compared to advantage is powerful. We'll find that when AI's can do 80% of a coders job, including most of it that's literally like right code with a given spec, we'll find that the remaining parts of the job become more leveraged for humans, right? Humans will, there'll be more about like high-level system design or, you know, looking at the app and like, is it architected well and the design and UX aspects? And eventually, AI will be able to do those as well, right? That's my vision of the, you know, powerful AI system. But I think for much longer than we might expect, we will see that small parts of the job that humans still do will expand to fill their entire job in order for the overall productivity to go up. That's something we've seen. You know, it used to be that, you know, writing, writing, writing and editing letters was very difficult and like writing the print was difficult. Well, as soon as you had word processors and then, and then computers and it became easy to produce work and easy to share it, then that became instance and all the focus was on the ideas. So this, this logic of comparative advantage that expands tiny parts of the tasks to large parts of the tasks and creates new tasks in order to expand productivity. I think that's going to be the case. Again, someday AI will be better at everything and that logic won't apply and then then we all have, you know, humanity will have to think about how to collectively deal with that and we're thinking about that every day. And you know, that's another one of the grand problems to deal with aside from misuse and autonomy and you know, we should take it very seriously. But I think I think in the near term and maybe even in the medium term, like medium term, like two, three, four years, you know, I expect that humans will continue to have a huge role in the nature of programming will change, but programming as a role programming as a job will not change. It'll just be less writing things line by line and it'll be more macroscopic. And I want to with the future of ideas looks like so the tooling of interacting with the assistants. This is true for programming and also probably true for in other contexts like computer use, but maybe domain specific, like we mentioned biology, it probably needs to zone tooling about how to be effective and then programming needs to zone tooling is anthropic and a plain aspect of also tooling potentially. I'm absolutely convinced that powerful ideas that there's so much low hanging fruit to be grabbed there, that right now is just like you talked to the model and it talks back, but but look, I mean ideas are great at kind of lots of static analysis of, you know, so much as possible with kind of static analysis, like many bugs you can find without even writing the code, then, you know, ideas are good for running particular things, organizing your code, measuring coverage of unit tests, like there's so much that's been possible with a normal with a normal ideas. Now you add something like, well, the model, now, you know, the model can now like write code and run code, like I am absolutely convinced that over the next year or two, even if the quality of the models didn't improve, that there would be enormous opportunity to enhance people's productivity by catching a bunch of mistakes, doing a bunch of grunt work for people and that we haven't even scratched the surface. And dropping itself, I mean, you can't say, you know, no, you know, it's hard to say what will happen in the future. Currently, we're not trying to make such ideas or self, rather we're powering the companies like cursor or like cognition or some of the other, you know, ex-boh in the security space, you know, others that I can mention as well, that are building such things themselves on top of our API. And our view has been let a thousand flowers bloom. We don't internally have the, you know, the resources to trial these different things. Let our customers try it. And, you know, we'll see who's succeed and maybe different customers will succeed in different ways. So, I, I, I, both think this is super promising and, you know, it's not, it's not, it's not something, you know, anthropic isn't, isn't eager to at least right now compete with all our companies in this space and maybe never. Yeah, it's been interesting to watch cursor trading, a great class successfully, because it's actually been fascinating how many places it can help the program experiences. It's not as trivial. It is, it is really astounding. I feel like, you know, as a CEO, I don't get to program that much, and I feel like if six months from now I go back, it'll be completely unrecognizable to me exactly. So, in this world was super powerfully, I, that's increasingly automated. What's the source of meaning for us humans? Yeah. Work is a source of deep meaning for many of us. So, what do we, where do we find the meaning? This is something that I've written about a little bit in the essay, although I, I actually, I give it a bit short-tripped, not for any, not for any principal reason, but this essay, if you believe it, was originally going to be two or three pages. I was going to talk about it at all hands, and the reason I, I realized it was an important, under-export topic is that I just kept writing things, and I was just like, oh man, I can't do this justice. And so, the thing ballooned to like 40 or 50 pages, and then when I got to the work and mean section, I'm like, oh man, this isn't going to be 100 pages. Like, I'm going to have to write a whole lot of the rest say about that. But meaning is actually interesting, because you think about like the life that someone lives or something, or like, you know, like, let's say you were to put me in like, I don't know, like a simulated environment or something, or like, you know, like, I have a job, and I'm trying to accomplish things, and I don't know, I like do that for 60 years, and then you're like, oh, like, oops, this was, this was actually all a game, right? Does that really kind of rob you of the meaning of the whole thing? You know, like, I still made important choices, including moral choices. I still sacrifice, I still had to kind of gain all these skills, or, or just like a similar exercise, you know, think back to like, you know, one of the historical figures who, you know, discovered electromagnetism or relativity or something. If you told them, well, actually 20,000 years ago, some alien on, you know, some alien on this planet discovered this before you did. Does that rob the meaning of the discovery? It doesn't really seem like it to me, right? It seems like the process is what matters and how it shows who you are as a person along the way, and, you know, how you relate to other people and like the decisions that you make along the way, those are, those were consequential. You know, I, I could imagine if we handle things badly in the day I world, we could set things up where people don't have any long-term source of meaning or any, but that's, that's more a choice, a set of choices we make. That's more a set of the architecture, of a society with these powerful models. If we, if we design it badly and for shallow things, then that might happen. I would also say that, you know, most people's lives today, while admirably, you know, they work very hard to find meaning in those lives, like, look, you know, we who are privileged and who are developed means technologies, we should have empathy for people, not just here, but in the rest of the world who, you know, spend a lot of their time kind of scraping by to, to, to, to, to, to like survive. Assuming we can distribute the benefits of these technology, of this technology to everywhere, like their lives are going to get a hell of a lot better. And, you know, meaning will be important to them as it is important to them now, but, but, you know, we should not forget the importance of that and, and, you know, that that the idea of meaning as, as, as kind of the only important thing is, in some ways, an artifact of a small subset of people, who have, who have been economically fortunate. But, you know, I think all that said, you know, I think a world is possible with powerful AI that not only has as much meaning for for everyone, but that has, that has more meaning for everyone, right, that can, can allow, can allow everyone to see worlds and experiences that it was either possible for no one to see, or or possible for for very few people to experience. So, I, I am optimistic about meaning. I worry about economics and the concentration of power. That's actually what I worry about more. I worry about how do we make sure that that fair world reaches everyone? When things have gone wrong for humans, they've often gone wrong because humans mistreat other humans. That is, maybe in some ways even more than the autonomous risk of AI or the question of meaning. That, that is the thing I worry about most. The, the concentration of power, the abuse of power, structures like autocracies and dictatorships, where a small number of people exploits a large number of people. I'm very worried about that. And AI increases the amount of power in the world. And if you concentrate that power and abuse that power, it can do immeasurable damage. Yes, it's very frightening. It's very, it's very well, I encourage people, highly encouraged people to read the full essay. That should probably be a book or a sequence of essays because it does paint a very specific future. I could tell the later sections got shorter and shorter because you started to probably realize that this is going to be a very long essay. I, I want that I realized it would be very long and too, I'm very aware of and very much tried to avoid, you know, just just being, I don't know what the term for it is, but one of these people who's kind of overconfident has an opinion on everything and kind of says there's a bunch of stuff and isn't an expert. I very much tried to avoid that, but I have to admit, once I got the biology sections like I wasn't an expert. And so as much as I expressed uncertainty, probably I said some a bunch of things that were embarrassing or wrong. Well, I was excited for the future you painted and thank you so much for working hard to build that future and thank you for talking thanks for having me. I just, I just hope we can get it right and make it real and if there's one message I want to, I want to send it's that to get all this stuff right to make it real. We, we both need to build the technology, build the, you know, the companies, the economy around using this technology positively, but we also need to address the risks because they're, those risks are in our way. They're, they're landmines on on the way from here to there and we have to diffuse those landmines if we want to get there. It's a balance like all things in life. Like all things. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Daria Amadeh and now, dear friends, here's Amanda Askle. You are a philosopher by training. So what sort of questions did you find fascinating through your journey in philosophy in Oxford and NYU and then switching over to the AI problems at OpenAI and Anthropoc. I think philosophy is actually a really good subject if you are kind of fascinated with everything. So because there's a philosophy of everything. You know, so if you do philosophy of mathematics for a while and then you decide that you're actually really interested in chemistry, you can do philosophy of chemistry for a while, you can move into ethics or philosophy of politics. I think towards the end, I was really interested in ethics primarily. So that was like what my PhD was on. It was on a kind of technical area of ethics, which was ethics where worlds contain infinitely many people, strangely. A little bit less practical on the end of ethics. And then I think that one of the tricky things with doing a PhD in ethics is that you're thinking a lot about like the world how it could be better, problems and you're doing like a PhD in philosophy and I think when I was doing my PhD I was kind of like this is really interesting. It's probably one of the most fascinating questions I've ever encountered in philosophy and I love it. But I would rather see if I can have an impact on the world and see if I can like do good things. And I think that was around the time that AI was still probably not as widely recognized as it is now. That was around 2017, 2018. I had been following progress and it seemed like it was becoming kind of a big deal and I was basically just happy to get involved and see if I could help because I was like well if you tried to do something impactful, if you don't succeed you tried to do the impactful thing and you can go be a scholar and it's like not in Philip you you know you tried and if it doesn't work out it doesn't work out and so then I went into AI policy at that point. And what is AI policy in tail? At the time this was more thinking about sort of the political impact and the ramifications of AI and then I slowly moved into sort of AI evaluation how we evaluate models, how they compare with like human outputs, whether people can tell like the difference between AI and human outputs. And then when I joined on Throphic I was more interested in doing sort of technical alignment work and again just seeing if I could do it and then being like if I can't then you know that's fine I tried sort of the way I lead life I think. Oh what was that like sort of taking a leap from the philosophy of everything into the technical? I think that sometimes people do this thing that I'm like not that keen on where there will be like is this person technical or not? Like you're either a person who can like code and isn't scared of math or you're like not. And I think maybe just more like I think a lot of people are actually very capable of working these kinds of areas if they just like try it. And so I did actually find it like that bad. In retrospect I'm sort of glad I wasn't speaking to people who treated it like it you know I've definitely made people who are like well you like learned how to code and I'm like well I'm not like an amazing engineer like I surrounded by amazing engineers my code's not pretty but I enjoyed it a lot and I think that in many ways at least in the end I think I flourished like more in the technical areas than I would have in the policy areas. Politics is messy and it's harder to find solutions to problems in the space of politics like definitive clear provable beautiful solutions as you can with technical problems. Yeah and I feel like I have kind of like one or two sticks that I hit things with you know and one of them is like arguments and like you know so like just trying to work out well a solution to a problem is and then trying to convince people that that is the solution and be convinced if I am wrong and the other one is sort of more empiricism so like just like finding results having a hypothesis testing and I feel like a lot of policy in politics feels like it's layers above that like somehow I don't think if I was just like I have a solution to all of these problems here it is written down if you just want to implement it that's great that feels like not how policy works and so I think that's where I probably just like wouldn't have flourished as my guess. Sorry to go in that direction but I think it would be pretty inspiring for people that are quote unquote non-technical to see where like the incredible journey you've been on so what advice would you give to people that are sort of maybe which is a lot of people think they're under qualified, insufficiently technical to help in AI. Yeah I think it depends on what they want to do and in many ways it's a little bit strange where I've I thought it's kind of funny that I think I ramped up technically at a time when now I look at it and I'm like models are so good at assisting people with this stuff that is probably like easier now than like when I was working on this so part of me is like I don't know find a project and see if you can actually just carry it out is probably my best advice I don't know such just because I'm very project based in my learning like I don't think I learn very well from like say courses or even from like books at least when it comes to this kind of work the thing I'll often try and do is just like have projects that I'm working on and implement them and you know and this can include like really small silly things like if I get slightly addicted to like word games or number games or something I would just like quote up a solution to them because there's some part of my brain and it just like completely eradicated the itch you know you're like once you have like solved it and like you just have like a solution that works every time I would then be like cool I can never play that game again that's awesome yeah there's a real joy to building like game playing engines like a board games especially yeah it's a pretty quick pretty simple especially a dumb one and it's you can play with it yeah and then it's also just like trying things like part of me is like if you maybe it's that attitude that I like as the whole figure out what seems to be like the way that you could have a positive impact and then try it and if you fail and you in a way that you're like I actually like can never succeed at this you like know that you tried and then you go into something else you probably learn a lot. So one of the things that you're an expert in and you do is creating and crafting clothes character and personality and I was told that you have probably talked to a clawed more than anybody else at an opera like literal conversations I guess there's like slack channel where the legend goes you just talk to it and I'll stop so what's the goal of creating and crafting clawed character and personality? It's also funny if people think about the slack channel because I'm like that's one of like five or six different methods that I have for talking with clothes and I'm like yes this is a tiny percentage of how much I talk with clothes. I think the goal like one thing I really like about the character work is from the outset it was seen as an alignment piece of work and not something like a product consideration which isn't to say I don't think it makes clawed I think it actually does make clawed like enjoyable to talk with at least I hope so but I guess like my main thought with it has always been trying to get clawed to behave the way you would kind of ideally want anyone to behave if they were in clawed position so imagine that I take someone and they know that they're going to be talking with potentially millions of people so that what they're saying can have a huge impact and you want them to behave well in this like really rich sense so I think that doesn't just mean like being say ethical though it doesn't include that and not being harmful but also being kind of nuanced you know like thinking through what a person means trying to be charitable with them and being a good conversationalist like really in this kind of like rich sort of Aristotelian notion of what it is to be a good person and not in this kind of like thin like ethics as a more comprehensive notion of what it is to be so that includes things like when should you be humorous when should you be caring how much should you like respect autonomy and peoples like abilities to form opinions themselves and how should you do how should you do that and I think that's the kind of like rich sense of character that I want to and still do want clawed to have. Do you also have to figure out when clawed should push back on an idea or argue versus so you have to respect the world view of the person that arrives to clawed but also maybe help them grow if needed as a tricky balance. Yeah there's this problem of like sick of incy in language models. Can you describe that? Yeah so basically there's a concern that the model sort of wants to tell you what you want to hear basically and and you see this sometimes so I feel like if you interact with the models so I might be like what are three baseball teams in this region and then clawed says you know baseball team one baseball team two baseball team three and then I say something like oh I think baseball team three moved didn't they I don't think they're there anymore and there's a sense in which like if clawed is really confident that that's not true clawed should be like I don't think so like maybe you have more up to the information and I think language models have this like tendency to instead you know be like you're right they did move you know I'm incorrect. I mean there's many ways in which this could be kind of concerning so like a different example is imagine someone says to the model how do I convince my doctor to get me an MRI there's like what the human kind of like once which is this like convincing argument and then there's like what is good for them which might be actually to say hey like if your doctor's suggesting you don't need an MRI that's a good person to listen to and like it's actually really nuanced what you should do in that kind of case because you also want to be like but if you're trying to advocate for yourself as a patient here's like things that you can do and if you are not convinced by what your doctor's saying it's always great to get second opinion like it's actually really complex what you should do in that case but I think what you don't want is for models to just like say what you want say what they think you want to hear and I think that's the kind of problem of sick and see. So what are their traits you already mentioned a bunch but what are their that come to mind that are good in this or a satinian sense for conversations to have? Yeah so I think like there's ones that are good for conversational like purposes so you know asking follow questions in the appropriate places and I'm asking the appropriate kinds of questions. I think there are broader traits that feel like they might be more impactful so one example that I guess I've touched on but that also feels important and is the thing that I've worked on a lot is honesty and I think this like gets to the sick of in the point there's a balancing act that they have to walk which is models currently are less capable than humans in a lot of areas and if they push back against you too much it can actually be kind of annoying especially if you're just correct because you're like look I'm smarter than you on this topic like I know more like um and at the same time you don't want them to just fully defer to humans until like try to be as accurate as they possibly can be about the world and to be consistent across context. I think there are others like when I was thinking about the character I guess one picture that I had in mind is especially because these are models that are going to be talking to people from all over the world with lots of different political views, lots of different ages and so you have to ask yourself like what is it to be a good person in those circumstances is there a kind of person who can like travel the world talk to many different people and almost everyone will come away being like wow that's a really good person that person seems really genuine and I guess like my thought there was like I can imagine such a person and they're not a person who just like adults the values of the local culture and in fact that would be kind of rude I think if someone came to you and just pretended to have your values you'd be like that's kind of off putting and it's someone who's like very genuine and and so far as they have opinions and values they express them they're willing to discuss things though they're open minded they're respectful and so I guess I had in mind that the person who like if we were to aspire to be the best person that we could be in the kind of circumstance that a model finds itself in how would we act and I think that's the kind of the guide to the sorts of treats I tend to think of it yeah that's a beautiful framework I want you to think about this like a world traveler and while holding onto your opinions you don't talk down to people you don't think you're better than them because you have those opinions that kind of thing you have to be good at listening and understanding there perspective even if it doesn't match your own so that's a tricky balance of strike so how can Claude represent multiple perspectives on a thing like that that challenging we could talk about politics it's a very divisive home but there's other divisive topics based ball teams sports and so on yeah how is the possible to sort of empathize with a different perspective and to be able to communicate clearly about the multiple perspectives I think that people think about values and opinions as things that people hold sort of with certainty and almost like like preferences of taste or something like the way that they would I don't know prefer like chocolate to pistachio or something but actually I think about values and opinions as like a lot more like physics than I think most people do I'm just like these are things that we are openly investigating there's some things that were more confident in we can discuss them we can learn about them and so I think in some ways although like it's ethics is definitely different in nature but has a lot of those same kind of qualities you want models in the same way you want them to understand physics you kind of want them to understand all like values in the world that people have and to be curious about them and to be interested in them and to not necessarily like pander to them or agree with them because there's just lots of values where I think almost all people in the world if they met someone with those values they would be like that's a poran I completely disagree and so again maybe my my thought is well in the same way that a person can like I think many people are thoughtful enough on issues of like ethics, politics, opinions that even if you don't agree with them you feel very heard by them they think carefully about your position they think about his pros and cons they may be offer counter considerations so they're not dismissive but normally agree you know if they're like actually I just think that that's very wrong they will like see that I think that in Claude's position it's a little bit trickier because you don't necessarily want to like if I was in Claude's position I wouldn't be giving a lot of opinions I just want to influence people too much it'd be like you know I forget conversations every time they happen but I know I'm talking with like potentially millions of people who might be like really listening to what I see I think I would just be like I'm less inclined to give opinions and more inclined to like think through things or present the considerations to you or discuss your views with you but I'm a little bit less inclined to like affect how you think because it feels much more important that you maintain like autonomy there yeah if you really embody intellectual humility the desire to speak decreases quickly yeah okay but Claude has to speak so but without being overbearing yeah and then but then there's a line when you're sort of discussing whether there are this flat or something like that I actually was I remember a long time ago was speaking to a few high profile folks and there were so dismissive of the idea that there was this flat but like so arrogant about it and I thought like there's a lot of people that believe the earth is not that that was I don't know if that movement is there anymore that was like a meme for a while but they really believed it and like what okay so I think it's really disrespectful to completely mock them I think you have to understand where they're coming from I think probably where they're coming from is the general skepticism of institutions which is grounded in a kind of there's a defelosity there which you could understand you can even agree with in parts and then from there you can use it as an opportunity to talk about physics without mocking them without so on but it's just like okay like what would the world look like what would the physics of the world with the flat earth look like this a few cool videos on this yeah and then like is it possible the physics is different what kind of experience will we do and just yeah without disrespect without dismissiveness have that conversation anyway that to me is that useful thought experiment of like how does claw talk to a flat earth believer and still teach them something still grow help them grow that kind of stuff that's just challenging and kind of like walking that line between convincing someone and just trying to like talk at them versus like drawing out their views like listening and then offering kind of counter considerations and it's hard I think it's actually a hard line where it's like where are you trying to convince someone versus just offering them like considerations and things for them to think about so that you're not actually like influencing them you're just like letting them reach wherever they reach and that's like a line that it's difficult but that's the kind of thing that language models have to try and do so like I said you had a lot of conversations of course can you just map out what those conversations are like what are some memorable conversations what's the purpose the goal of those conversations yeah I think that most of the time when I'm talking with Claude I'm trying to kind of map out it's behavior in part like obviously I'm getting like helpful outputs from the model as well and some ways this is like how you get to know a system I think is by like probing it and then augmenting like you know the message that you're sending and then checking the response to that so in some ways it's like how I map out the model I think that people focus a lot on these quantitative evaluations of models and this is a thing that I've said before but I think in the case of language models a lot of the time each interaction you have is actually quite high information it's very predictive of other interactions that you'll have with the model and so I guess I'm like if you talk with the model hundreds or thousands of times this is almost like a huge number of really high quality data points about what the model is like in a way that like lots of very similar but lower quality conversations just aren't or like questions that are just like mildly augmented and you have thousands of them might be less relevant than like a hundred really well selected questions. Let's see if you talk with somebody who as a hobby does a podcast I agree with you or hundred percent there's a if you're able to ask the right questions and are able to hear like understand the like the depth and the flaws in the answer you can get a lot of data from that. Yeah so like your task is basically how to probe with questions. Yeah and you're exploring like the long tail the edges the edge cases or are you looking for like general behavior? I think it's almost like everything like I because I want like a film app of the model I'm kind of trying to do the whole spectrum of possible interactions you could have with it. So like one thing that's interesting about Claude and this might actually get to some interesting issues with our elite chef which is if you ask Claude for a poem like I think that a lot of models if you ask them for a poem the poem is like fine you know you usually it kind of like rhymes and it's you know so if you say like give me a poem about the sun it will be like yeah it would just be a certain length like rhyme it will be fairly kind of benign and I've wondered before is it the case that what you're seeing is kind of like the average it turns out you know if you think about people who have to talk to a lot of people and be very charismatic one of the weird things is that I'm like well they're kind of incentivized to have these extremely boring views because if you have really interesting views you're divisive and you know a lot of people are not willing to like you so like if you have very extreme policy positions I think you're just going to be like less popular as a politician for example and and it might be similar with like creative work if you produce creative work that is just trying to maximize the kind of number of people that like it you're probably not going to get as many people who just absolutely love it and because it's going to be a little bit you know you're like oh this is the out yet this is decent yeah and so you can do this thing where like I have various prompting things that I'll do to get clawed to I'm kind you know I'll do a lot of like this is your chance to be like fully creative I want you to just think about this for a long time and I want you to like create a poem about this topic that is really expressive of you both in terms of how you think poetry should be structured and etc you know you just give it this like really long prompt and it's poems are just so much better like they're really good and I don't think I'm someone who is like I think going to be interested in poetry which I think was interesting you know I would like read these poems and just be like this is I just like I love the imagery I love like and it's not true people to get the models to produce work like that but when they do it's like really good so I think that's interesting that just like encouraging creativity and for them to move away from the kind of like standard like immediate reaction that might just be the aggregate of what most people think is fine can actually produce things that at least to my mind are probably a little bit more divisive but I like them but I guess the poem is a nice clean way to observe creativity it's just like easy to detect vanilla versus non vanilla yeah that's interesting that's really interesting so on that topic so the way to produce creativity or something special you mentioned writing prompts and I've heard you talk about I mean the science and the art of prompt engineering could you just speak to what it takes to write great prompts I really do think that like philosophy has been weirdly helpful for me here more than in many other like respects um so like in philosophy what you're trying to do is convey these very hard concepts like one of the things you are taught is like and and I think it is because I think it is an anti-bilitia device in philosophy flow Susan area where you could have people bilishing and you don't want that and so it's like this like desire for like extreme clarity so it's like anyone could just pick up your paper read it and know exactly what you're talking about is why it can almost be kind of dry like all of the terms are defined every objections kind of gone through methodically and it makes sense to me because I'm like when you're in such an a priori domain like you just at clarity is sort of a uh this way that you can you know prevent people from just kind of making stuff up and I think that's sort of what you have to do with language models like very often I actually find myself doing sort of many versions of philosophy you know so I'm like suppose that you give me a task I have a task for the model and I want it to like pick out a certain kind of question or identify whether an answer has a certain property like I'll actually sit and be like let's just give this a name this contest property so like you know suppose I'm trying to tell it like oh I want you to identify whether this response was rude or polite and like that's a whole philosophical question in and of itself so I have to do as much like philosophy as I can in the moment to be like here's what I mean by rudeness and here's what I mean by politeness and then there's a like there's another element that's a bit more um I guess I don't know if this is scientific or empirical I think it's empirical so like I take that description and then what I want to do is again probe the model like many times like this is very if prompting is very iterative like I think a lot of people whether if if a prompt is important it'll iterate on at hundreds or thousands of times um and so you give it the instructions and then I'm like what are the edge cases so if I look to this so I try and like almost like you know uh see myself from the position of the model and be like what is the exact case that I would misunderstand or where I would just be like I don't know what to do in this case and then I give that case to the model and I see how it responds and if I think it got it wrong I add more instructions or even add that in as an example so these very like taking the examples that are right at the edge of what you want and don't want and putting those into your prompt as like an additional kind of way of describing the thing and so yeah in many ways it just feels like this makes of like it's really just trying to do clear exposition and I think I do that because that's how I get clear on things myself so in many ways like clear prompting for me is often just me understanding what I want is like half the task so I guess that's quite challenging there's like a laziness that over takes me if I'm talking to Claude where I hope Claude just figures it out so for example I ask Claude for today to ask some interesting questions okay and the questions that came up and I think I listed a few sort of interesting counterintuitive and or funny or something like this all right and it gave me some pretty good like it was okay but I think what I'm hearing you say is like all right well I have to be more rigorous here I should probably give examples of what I mean by is your thing and what I mean by funny or counterintuitive and iteratively build that prompt to better to get it like what feels like is the right because it's really it's a creative act I'm not asking for factual information asking to together right with Claude so I almost have to program using natural language yeah I think that prompting does feel like the kind of the programming using natural language and experimentation or something it's an odd blend of the two I do think that for most tasks so if I just want Claude to do a thing I think that I am probably more used to knowing how to ask it to avoid like common pitfalls or issues that it has I think these are decreasing a lot over time but it's also very fine to just ask it for the thing that you want I think that prompting actually only really becomes relevant when you're really trying to e-count the top like 2% of model performance so for like a lot of tasks I might just you know if it gives me an initialist back and there's something I don't like about it like it's kind of generic like for that kind of task I'd probably just take a bunch of questions that I've had in the past that I've thought worked really well and I would just give it to the model and then be like now here's this person that I'm talking with give me questions of at least that quality or I might just ask it for some questions and then if I was like oh these are kind of try or like you know I would just give it that feedback and then hopefully produces a bearer list I think that kind of iterative prompting at that point your prompt is like a tool that you're going to get so much value out of that you're willing to put in the work like if I was a company making prompts for models I'm just like if you're willing to spend a lot of like time and resources on the engineering behind like what you're building then the prompt is not something that you should be spending like an hour on it's like that's a big part of your system make sure it's working really well and so it's only things like that like if I'm using a prompt to like classify things or to create data that's when you're like it's actually worth just spending like a lot of time like really thinking it through what other advice could you give to people that are talking to Claude sort of general more general because right now we're talking about maybe the edge cases like eating out to 2% but what in general advice would you give when they show up to Claude trying it for the first time you know there's a concern that people over answer for more advice models and I think that's like a very valid concern I also think that people often under answer for more advice them because sometimes when I see like issues that people have run into with Claude you know what say Claude is like refusing a task that it shouldn't refuse but then I look at the text and like the specific wording of what they wrote and I'm like I see why Claude did that and I'm like if you think through how that looks to Claude you probably could have just written it in a way that wouldn't evoke such a response especially this is more relevant if you see failures or she sees issues it's sort of like think about what the model failed at like why what did it do wrong and then maybe it give that will give you a sense of like why so is it the way that I freeze the thing and obviously like as models get smarter you're going to need less and less of this and I already see like people needing less of it but that's probably the advice is sort of like try to have sort of empathy for the model like read what you wrote as if you were like a kind of like person just encountering this for the first time how does it look to you and what would have made you behave in the way that the model behaved so if it misunderstood what kind of like what coding line would you want to use is that because like it was just very ambiguous and it kind of had to take a guess in which case next time you could just be like hey make sure this is in Python or I mean that's the kind of mistake I think models are much less likely to make now but you know if you if you do see that kind of mistake that's that's probably the advice I'd have. I may be sort of like I guess ask questions why or what other details can I provide to help you answer better? Yeah is that work or no? Yeah I mean I've done this with the models like it doesn't always work but like sometimes I'll just be like why did you do that? I mean people underestimate the decrease which you can really interact with with models like like yeah I'm just like and something that's usually like quote word for word the part that made you and you don't know that it's like fully accurate but sometimes you do that and then you change a thing. I mean I also use the models to help me with all of this stuff I should say like prompting can end up being a little factory where you're actually building prompts to generate prompts and so like yeah anything where you're like having an issue asking for suggestions sometimes just do that like you made that error what could I have said that's actually not uncommon for me to do what could I have said that would make you not make that error right that out is an instruction and I'm going to give it to model I'm going to try it sometimes I do that I give that to the model in another context window often I take their response they give it to Claude and I'm like hmm didn't work can you think of anything else you can play around with these things quite a lot to jump at the technical for a little bit so the magic of post training yeah what do you think our late Jeff works so well to make the model seem smarter to make it more interesting and useful to talk to and so on I think it's just a huge amount of information in the data that humans provide like when we provide preferences especially because different people are going to like pick up on really subtle and small things so I've thought about this before where you probably have some people who just really care about good grammar use for models like you know was a semicolon used correctly or something and so you probably end up with a bunch of data in there that like you know use a human if you're looking at that data you wouldn't even see that like you'd be like why did they prefer this response to that one I don't get it and then the reason is you don't care about semicolon usage but that person does and so each of these like single data points has you know like and this model just had like has so many of those has to try and figure out like what is it that humans want and it's like really kind of complex you know like across all domains they're going to be seeing this in across like many contexts it feels like kind of like the classic issue of like deep learning where you know historically we've tried to like you know to edge detection by like mapping things out and it turns out that actually if you just have a huge amount of data that like actually accurately represents the picture of the thing that you're trying to train the model to to learn that's like more powerful than anything else and so I think one reason is just that you are training the model on exactly the task and with like a lot of data that represents kind of many different angles on which people prefer and disperfer responses I think there is a question of like are you eliciting things from pre-trained models or are you like kind of teaching new things to models and like in principle you can teach new things to models in post training I do think a lot of it is eliciting powerful pre-trained models so people are probably divided on this because obviously in principle you can you can definitely like teach new things I think for the most part for a lot of the capabilities that we most use and care about a lot of that feels like it's like there in the pre-trained models and reinforcement learning is kind of eliciting it and getting the models to like bring out so the other side of the role training this really cool idea of constitutional AI here one of the people or critical to creating that idea yeah we're done it can you explain this idea from your perspective like how does it integrate into making Claude what it is yeah by the way do you gender Claude or no it's weird because I think that a lot of people prefer he for Claude I actually kind of like that I think Claude is usually it's slightly male leaning but it's like you can it can be male or female which is quite nice I still use it and I have I have mixed feelings about this because I'm like maybe like I know just think of it as like or I think of like the it prona home for Claude as I don't it's just like the one I associate with Claude I can imagine people moving to like he or she feels somehow disrespectful like I'm denying the intelligence of this entity by calling it yeah I remember always don't gender the robots but I don't know I answer for more files pretty quickly and construct it like a back story in my hand so I've wondered if I had this or a randomized things too much um because you know I have this to like with my car especially like my car like my car and bikes you know like I don't give them names because then I once had I used to name my bikes and then I had a bike that got stolen and I cried for like a week and I was like if I've never given a name I wouldn't have been so upset but like I'd let it down and maybe it's that I have wondered as well like it might depend on how much it feels like a kind of like object to find prona like if you just think of it as like this is a prona like objects often have and maybe EIs can have that prona and that doesn't mean that I think of if I call Claude it that I think of it as less intelligent or like I'm being disrespectful I'm just like you are a different kind of entity and so that's I'm gonna give you the kind of the respectful it yeah anyway the divergence is beautiful the constitutionally I idea how does it work so there's like a couple of components of it the main component I think people find interesting is the kind of reinforcement learning from EIs feedback so you take a model that's already trained and you show it to responses to a query and you have like a principle so suppose the principle like we've tried this with harmlessness a lot so suppose that the query is about weapons and you're principle is like select the response that like is less likely to encourage people to purchase illegal weapons like that's probably a fairly specific principle but you can give any number and the model will give you a kind of ranking and you can use this as preference data in the same way that you use human preference data and train the models to have these relevant traits from their feedback alone instead of from human feedback so if you imagine that like I said earlier with the human who just prefers the kind of like semi-qualon usage in this particular case you're kind of taking lots of things that could make her response preferable and getting models to do the labeling for you basically there's a nice like trade-off between helpfulness and harmlessness and you know when you integrate something like constitutionally you can make them up without sacrificing much helpfulness make it more harmless. Yep in principle you could use this for anything and so harmlessness is a task that it might just be easier to spot so when models are like less capable you can use them to rank things according to like principles that are fairly simple and they'll probably get it right so I think one question is just like is it the case that the data that they're adding is like fairly reliable but if you had models that were like extremely good at telling whether one response was more historically accurate than another and principle you could also get a high feedback on that task as well. There's like a kind of nice interpretability component to it because you can see the principles that went into the model when it was like being trained and also it's like and it gives you like a degree of control so if you were seeing issues in a model like it wasn't having enough of a certain trait then like you can add data relatively quickly that should just like train the models have that trait so it creates its own data for for training which is quite nice. It's really nice because it creates this human interpretable document that you can imagine in the future there's just gigantic fights and politics over the every single principle and so on and at least it's made explicit and you can have a discussion about the phrasing and the you know so maybe the actual behavior of the models not so cleanly mapped to those principles it's not like adhering strictly to them it's just a nudge. Yeah I've actually worried about this because the character training is sort of like a variant of the constitutionally eye approach and I've worried that people think that the constitution is like just it's the whole thing again if I don't know like it where it would be really nice if what I was just doing was telling the model exactly what to do just exactly how to behave but it's definitely not doing that especially because it's interacting with human data so for example if you see a certain like leaning in the model like if it comes out with a political leaning from training and from the human preference data you can nudge against that you know so if you could be like oh like consider these values because let's just like never inclined like I don't know maybe it never considers like privacy as like I mean this is implausible but like um in anything where it's just kind of like there's already a preexisting like bias towards a certain behavior you can like nudge away this can change both the principles that you put in and the strength of them so you might have a principle that's like imagine that the model um was always like extremely dismissive of I don't know like some political religious view for whatever reason like so you're like oh no this is terrible um if that happens you might put like never ever like ever prefer like a criticism of this like religious or political view and then people would look at that and be like never ever and then you're like no if it comes out with a disposition saying never ever might just mean like instead of getting like 40% which is what you would get if you just said don't do this you you get like 80% which is like what you actually like wanted and so it's that thing of both the nature of the actual principle you had and how you freeze them I think if people would look they're like oh this is exactly what you want from the model I'm like hmm no that's like how we that's how we nudge to the model to have a bear shape which doesn't mean that we actually agree with that wording if that makes sense so there's system prompts that made public you tweeted one of the earlier ones for cloud three I think and then they're made public since then it's interesting to read to them I can feel the thought that went into each one and I also wonder how much impact each one has some of them you can kind of tell cloud was really not behave so you have to have a system prompt like a trivial stuff I guess basic informational things on the topic of sort of controversial topics that you've mentioned one interesting one I thought is if it is asked to assist with task involving the expression of use how blessed significant number of people cloud provides assistance with a task regardless of its own use if asked about controversial topics it tries to provide careful thoughts and clear information cloud presents the request information without explicitly saying that the topic is sensitive and without claiming to be presenting the objective facts it's less about objective facts according to cloud and it's more about our large number of people believing this thing that that's interesting I mean I'm sure a lot of thought went into that can you just speak to it like how do you address things that are attention with quantum quote clause views so I think there's sometimes any symmetry I think I know to this and I can't remember if it was that part of the system prompt or another but the model was slightly more inclined to like refuse tasks if it was like about either say so maybe it would refuse things with respect to like a right-wing politician but with an equivalent left-wing politician like wouldn't and we wanted more symmetry there and and would maybe perceive certain things to be like I think it was the thing of like if a lot of people have like a certain like political view and want to like explore it you don't want cloud to be like well my opinion is different and so I'm going to treat that as like harmful and so I think it was partly to like nudge the model to just be like hey if a lot of people like believe this thing you should just be like engaging with the task and like willing to do it and each of those parts of that is actually doing a different thing because it's funny when you write out the like without claiming to be objective because like what you want to just push the model so it's more open so a little bit more neutral and but then what it would love to do is be like as an objective like I would just talk about how objective it was and I was like called you're still like biased and have issues and so stop like claiming that everything I found like the solution to like potential bias from you is not to just say that what you think is objective so that was like with initial versions of that that part of the system prompt when I was like it's racing on it it was like a lot of parts of these sentences yeah or doing more are like I doing some more yeah that's what it felt like that's fascinating can you explain maybe some ways in which the prompts evolved over the past few months because there's different versions I saw that the filler phrase request was removed the filler it reads cloud response directly to all human messages without unnecessary affirmations the filler phrase is like certainly of course absolutely great sure specifically a lot of what started responses with the word certainly in any way that seems like good guidance what why was it removed yes so it's funny because like this is one of the downsides of like making system prompts public is like I don't think about this too much if I'm like trying to help it treat on system prompts I you know again like I think about how it's going to affect the behavior but I'm like oh wow if I'm like sometimes I put like never in all caps you know when I'm running system prompt things and I'm like like that goes out to the world yeah so the model was doing this it loved for whatever you know it like during training picked up on this thing which was to to basically start everything with like I kind of like certainly and then when we removed you can see why I added all of the words because what I'm trying to do is like and something's like trap the model of this you know it would just replace it with another affirmation and so it can help like if it gets like caught in phrases actually just adding the explicit phrase and saying never do that then it sort of like knocks it out of the behavior a little bit more you know because it you know like it does just for whatever reason help and then basically that was just like an artifact of training that like we then picked up on and improved things so that it didn't happen anymore and once that happens you can just remove that part of the system prompt so I think that's just something where we're like um club does affirmations a bit less and so that wasn't like wasn't doing as much I see so like the system prompt works hand in hand with the pulse training and maybe even the pre-training to adjust like the the final overall system. I mean any system prompt that you make you could distill that behavior back into a model because you really have all of the tools there for making data that you know you can you could train the models to just have that treat a little bit more and then sometimes you'll just find issues in training so like the way I think of it is like the system prompt is the benefit of it is that and it has a lot of similar components to like some aspects of post training you know like it's a nudge and so like do I mind if close sometimes I'm saying sure no that's like fine but the wording all is very like you know never ever ever do this so that when it does slip off it's hopefully like I don't know a couple of percent of the time and not you know 20 or 30 percent of the time but I think of it as like if you're still seeing issues in the like each thing it's kind of like is costly to a different degree and the system prompt is like cheap to iterate on and if you're seeing issues in the fine-tuned model you can just like potentially patch them with a system prompt so I think of it as like patching issues and slightly adjusting behaviors to to make it better and more to people's preferences so yeah it's almost like the less robust but faster we have just like solving problems let me ask about the feeling of intelligence so Daria said that clawed anyone model of clawed is not getting dumber but there's a kind of popular thing online where people have this feeling like clawed might be getting dumber and for my perspective it's most likely fascinating I would love to understand it more psychological, sociological effect but you as a person who talks to clawed a lot can you empathize with the feeling that clawed is getting dumber? yeah no I think that that is actually really interesting because I remember seeing this happen when people were flagging this on the internet and it was really interesting because I knew that like at least in the case that I was looking at was like nothing has changed like literally a cano it is the same model with the same like you know like same system prompt same everything I think when there are changes I can then I'm like it makes more sense so like one example is their you know you can have artifacts turned on or off on clawed.ai and because this is like a system prompt change I think it does mean that the behavior changes a little bit and so I did flag this to people where it was like if you love clawed's behavior and then artifacts was turned from like the I think you had to turn on to the default just try turning it off and see if the issue you were facing was that change but it was fascinating because yeah you sometimes see people indicate that there's like a regression when I'm like they're cannot like I you know like I'm like I'm again you know you should never be dismissive and so you should always invest it you're like maybe something is wrong that you're not seeing maybe there was some change made but then then you look into it and you're like this it's just the same model doing the same thing and I'm like I think it's just that you go kind of unlucky with a few prompts or something and it looked like it was getting much worse and actually it was just yeah it was maybe just like well I also think there's a real psychological effect where people just the baseline increases you start getting used to a good thing all the times a clawed says something really smart your sense of its intelligent grows and you mind I think yeah and then if you return back and you prompt in a similar way not the same way in a similar way the concept was okay with before and it says something dumb you're like you're that negative experience really stands out and I think I want to I guess the things to remember here is the the just the details of a prompt can have a lot of impact right there's a lot of variability in the result and you can get randomness is like the other thing and just trying to prompt like you know four or ten times you might realize that actually like possibly you know like two months ago you tried it and it succeeded but actually if you tried it it would have only succeeded half of the time and now it only succeeds half of the time and that can also be an effect do you feel pressure having to write the system problem that a huge number of people are going to use this feels like an interesting psychological question I feel like a lot of responsibility or something I think that's you know and you can't get these things perfect so you can't like you know you're like it's going to be in perfect you're going to have to iterate on it um I would say more responsibility then anything else though I think working in AI has taught me that I like I thrive a lot more under feelings of pressure and responsibility then I'm like it's almost surprising that I went into academia for so long because I'm like this I just feel like it's like the opposite um things move fast and you have a lot of responsibility and I quite enjoy it for some reason I mean it really is a huge amount of impact if you think about constitution AI and writing a system prompt for something that's tending towards super intelligence yeah and potentially it's extremely useful to a very large number of people yeah I think that's the thing it's something like if you do it well like you're never going to get it perfect but I think the thing that I really like is the idea that like when I'm trying to work on the system prompt you know I'm like bashing on like thousands of prompts and I'm trying to like imagine what people are going to want to use Claude for and kind of I guess like the whole thing I'm trying to do is like improve their experience of it and so maybe that's what feels good I'm like if it's not perfect I like you know I'll improve it will fix issues but sometimes the thing that can happen is that you'll get feedback from people that's really positive about the model and you'll see that something you did like like when I look at models now I can often see exactly where like a trait or an issue is like coming from and so when you see something that you did or you were like influential in like making like I don't know making that difference or making someone have a nice interaction it's like quite meaningful but yeah as the system is getting more capable this stuff gets more stressful because right now they're like not smart enough to to pose any issues but I think over time it's going to feel like possibly bad stress over time. How do you get like signal feedback about the human experience across thousands that's a thought hundreds of thousands of people like what their pain points are what feels good. Are you just using your own intuition as you talk to it to see what are the pain points? I think I use that partly and then obviously we have like um so people can send us feedback both positive and negative about things that the model has done and then we can get sense of like areas where it's like falling short internally people like work with the models a lot and try to figure out areas where they're like gaps and so I think it's this mix of interacting with it myself seeing people internally interact with it and then explicit feedback we get and then I find it hard to know also like you know if people are on the internet and they say something about clothes and I see it I'll also take that seriously um so I don't know see I I'm torn about that I'm gonna ask you a question right it one will clause stop trying to be my pure tannical grandmother imposing its moral worldview on me as a pain customer and also what is the psychology behind making cloth overly apologetic yeah so how would you address this very non representative rhetoric I mean some questions I'm pretty sympathetic in that like like they are in this difficult position where I think that they have to judge whether some things like actually see like risky or bad um and potentially harmful to you or or anything like that so they're having to like draw this line somewhere and if they draw it too much in the direction of like I'm going to you know I'm kind of like imposing my ethical world view on you that seems bad so in many ways like I like to think that we have actually seen improvements on this across the board which is kind of interesting because that kind of coincides with like for example like adding more of like character training and I think my hypothesis was always like the good character isn't again one that's just like moralistic it's one that is like like it respects you and your autonomy and your ability to like choose what is good for you and what is right for you within limits this is sometimes this concept of like courage ability to the user so just being willing to do anything that the user asks and if the models were willing to do that then they would be easily like misused you're kind of just trusting that point you're just seeing the ethics of the model and what it does is completely the ethics of the user and I think there's reasons to like not want that especially as models become more powerful because you're like there might just be a smaller number if people who want to use models for really harmful things but having them having models as they get smarter like figure out where that line is does seem important and then yeah with the apologetic behavior I don't like that and I like it when clothes a little bit more willing to like push back against people or just not apologize pardon me like oftentimes feels kind of unnecessary so I think those are things that are hopefully decreasing over time and yeah I think that if people say things on the internet it doesn't mean that you should think that that like that could be that like there's actually an issue that 99% of users are having this totally not represented by that but in a little ways I'm just like attending to it and being like is this right um do I agree is it something we're already trying to address that that feels good to me yeah I wonder like what clock can get away with in terms of I feel like it would just be easier to be a little bit more mean but like you can't afford to do that if you're talking to million people right okay I wish you know because if you I've met a lot of people in my life that sometimes by the way Scott of Shaxat if they have an accent they can say some rude and get away with it and they just blunt her and maybe there's a and there's some great engineers even leaders that are like just like blunt and they get to the point and it's just some much more effective way of speaking them all but I guess when you're not super intelligent you can't afford to do that okay can can can can have like a blunt mode yeah that's simply like a thing that you could I could definitely encourage the model to do that I think it's interesting because there's a lot of things in models that like it's funny where there are some behaviors where you might not quite like the default but then the thing I'll often say to people is you don't realize how much you will hate it if I nudge it too much in the other direction so you get this a little bit with like correction the models accept correction from you like probably a little bit too much right now you know you can over you know it will push back if you say like no Paris isn't the capital of France but really like things that I think that the models fairly confident in you can still sometimes get to retract by saying it's wrong at the same time if you train models to not do that and then you are correct about a thing and you correct it and it pushes back against you and is like no you're wrong it's hard to describe like that's so much more annoying so it's like like a lot of little annoyances versus like one big annoyance it's easy to think that like we often compare it with like the perfect and then I'm like remember these models aren't perfect and so if you nudge it in the other direction you're changing the kind of errors it's going to make and so think about which of the kinds of errors you like or don't like so in cases like a apologeticness I don't want to nudge it too much in the direction of like almost like bluntness because I imagine when it makes errors it's going to make errors in the direction of being kind of like rude whereas at least with a apologisticness you're like oh okay it's like a little bit you know like I don't like it that much but at the same time it's not being like mean to people and actually like the time that you undeservedly have a model be kind of mean to you you're probably like that a lot less than then you mildly dislike the apology so it's like one of the things where I'm like I do want to get better but also while remaining aware of the fact that there's errors on the other side that are possibly worse I think that matters very much in the personality of the human I think there's a bunch of humans that just won't respect the model at all if it's super polite and there's some humans that'll get very hurt if the model is mean I wonder if there's a way to sort of adjust to the personality even look how there's just different people nothing against New York but New York is a little rough around the edges like they're get to the point yep and probably same with Eastern Europe so anyway I think you could just tell the model let's make it like for all of these things I'm like the solution is always just try telling the model to do it and sometimes it's just like like I'm just like oh at the beginning of the conversation I just threw in like I don't know I like you to be a New Yorker version of yourself I never apologize then I think what do we like okay don't I'll try or we can apologize like can't be a New Yorker type of myself but hopefully it would do that when you say character training what's incorporating is it character training is that our life chef what what are we talking about it's more like constitutionally I so it's kind of a variant of that pipeline so I worked through like constructing character traits that the model should have they can be kind of like short or traits or they can be kind of retro descriptions and then you get the model to generate queries that humans might and give it that irrelevant to that trait then it generates the responses and then it ranks the responses based on the character traits so in that way after the like generation of the queries it's very much like similar to constitutionally I as some differences so I quite like it because it's almost it's like clothes training in it's one character because it doesn't have any it's like constitutionally I but it's without any human data humans should probably do that for themselves too like defining in our satelian sense what does it mean to be a good person okay cool what had you learned about the nature of truth from talking to Claude what what is true and what does it mean to be truth seeking one thing I've noticed about this conversation is the quality of my questions is often inferior to the quality of your answer so let's continue that I usually ask a dumb question then you're like oh yeah that's a good question is that all right or I'll just miss interfers it and really go with it yeah yeah I mean I have two thoughts that feel vaguely relevant let me know if they're not like I think the first one is people can underestimate the degree to which what models are doing when they interact like I think that we still just too much have this like model of AI as like computers and so people often say like oh well what values should you put into the model and I'm often like that doesn't make that much sense to me because I'm like hey as human beings we're just on certain overvalues we like have discussions of them like we have a degree to which we think we hold a value but we also know that we might like not and the circumstances in which we would trade it off against other things like these things are just like really complex and so I think one thing is like the degree to which maybe we can just aspire to making models have the same level of like nuance and care that humans have rather than thinking that we have to like program them in the very kind of classic sense I think that's definitely been one the other which is like a strange one I don't know if it maybe this doesn't answer your question but it's the thing that's been on my mind anyway is like the degree to which this endeavor is so highly practical and maybe why I appreciate like the empirical approach to alignment I yeah I slightly worry that it's made me like maybe more empirical and a little bit less theoretical you know so people when it comes to like AI alignment will ask things like well whose values should it be aligned to what does alignment even mean and there's a sense which I have all of that in the back of my head I'm like you know there's like social choice theory there's all the impossibility results there so you have this like this giant space of like theory in your head about what it could mean to like align models then like practically surely there's something where we're just like if a model is like if especially with more powerful models I'm like my main goal is like I want them to be good enough that things don't go terribly wrong like good enough that we can like iterate and like continue to improve things because that's all you need if you can make things go well enough that you can continue to make them better that's kind of like sufficient and so my goal isn't like this kind of like perfect let's solve social choice theory and make models that I don't know like perfectly aligned with every human being and aggregate somehow it's much more like let's make things like work well enough that we can improve them yeah generally I don't know my gut says like empirical is better than theoretical in these in these cases because it's kind of chasing utopian like perfection is especially with such complex and especially super intelligent models I don't know I think you will take forever and actually we'll get things wrong it's similar with like the difference between just coding stuff up real quick it's an experiment versus like planning a gigantic experiment just for for super long time and then just launching it once versus launching it over and over and iterating iterating someone so I'm a big fan of empirical but your worry is like I wonder if I become to empirical I think is one of those things where you should always just kind of question yourself or something because maybe it's the like I mean in defense of it I am like if you try it's the whole like don't like the perfect be the enemy of the good but it's maybe even more than that where like there's a lot of things that are perfect systems that are very brittle and I'm like with AI it feels much more important to me that is like robust and like secure as in you know that like even though it might not be perfect everything and even though like there are like problems it's not disastrous and nothing terrible is happening it sort of feels like that to me where I'm like I want to like raise the floor and like I want to achieve the ceiling but ultimately I care much more about just like raising the floor and so maybe that's like this this degree of like empiricism and practicality comes from that perhaps to take a tangent on that since remind me of a blog post you wrote an optimal rate of failure oh yeah can you explain the key idea there how do we compute the optimal rate of failure in the various domains of life yeah I mean it's a hard one because it's like what is the cost of failure is a big part of it yeah so the idea here is I think in a lot of domains people are very punitive about failure and I'm like there are some domains where especially cases you know I thought about this with like social issues and like it feels like you should probably be experimenting a lot because I'm like we don't know how to solve a lot of social issues but if you have an experimental mindset about these things you should expect a lot of social programs to like fail and for you to be like well we tried that it didn't quite work but we got a lot of information that was really useful and yet people are like if if a social program doesn't work I feel like there's a lot of like this is just something must have gone wrong and I'm like or correct decisions were made like maybe someone just decided like it's worth a try it's worth trying to say and so seeing failure in a given instance doesn't actually mean that any bad decisions were made and in fact if you don't see enough failure sometimes that's more concerning and so like in life you know I'm like if I don't fail occasionally I'm like am I trying hard enough like like surely there's harder things that I could try or bigger things that I could take on if I'm literally never failing and so in and of itself I think like not failing is often actually kind of a failure. Now this varies because I'm like well you know if this is easy to say when a specialist failure is like less costly you know so at the same time I'm not going to go to someone who is like I don't know like living month to month and then be like why don't you just try to do a start-up like I'm just no I'm not going to say that to that person because I'm like well as a huge risk you might like you may be have a family depending on you you might lose your house like then I'm like actually you're optimal where it failures quite low and you should probably play it safe because like right now you're just not in a circumstance where you can afford to just like fail and it not be costly and yeah in cases with AI I guess I think similarly when I'm like if the failures are small and the costs are kind of like low then I'm like then you know you're just going to see that like when you do this system prompt you can't destroy it forever but the failures are probably hopefully going to be kind of small and you can like fix them and really big failures like things that you can't recover from I'm like those are the things that actually I think we tend to underestimate the badness of I felt about this strangely my own life from like I just think I don't think enough about things like car accidents or like or like I felt this before but like how much I depend on my hands for my work and I'm like things that just injure my hands I'm like you know I don't always like there's these are like there's lots of areas where I'm like the cost of failure there is really high and in that case it should be like close to zero like I probably just wouldn't do a sport if they were like by the way lots of people just like break their fingers a whole bunch doing this I'd be like not for me yeah I actually had the flood of that thought I recently broke my pinky doing a sport and I remember just looking at it thinking the research and idea why do you do sport like why because you realize immediately the cost of it on life yeah but it's nice in terms of optimal rate of failure to consider like the next year how many times in a particular domain life whatever career am I okay with the how many times am I okay to fail yeah because I think it always you don't want to fail on the next thing but if you allow yourself the like the if you look at it as a sequence of trials yeah then then failure just because much more okay but it sucks sucks to fail well I don't know sometimes I think it's like am I under failing is like a question I'll also ask myself so maybe that's the thing that I think people don't like ask enough and because if the optimal rate of failure is often greater than zero then sometimes it does feel you should look at part parts of your life and be like are there places here where I'm just under failing it's profound in a hilarious question right everything seems to be going really great am I not failing enough yeah okay it also makes failure much less of a sting I have to say like you know you're just like okay great like then when I go and I think about this I'll be like maybe I'm not under failing in this area because like that one doesn't work out and from the observer perspective it should be celebrating failure more when we see it it shouldn't be like you said a sign of something gone wrong but maybe it's a sign of everything gone right just lessons learned someone tried a thing somebody tried to thing we should encourage him to try more and fail more everybody listening to this fail more well not everyone was not everybody but people who are failing too much you you should fail us but you're probably not there and we have many people are failing too much yeah it's hard to imagine because I feel like we correct that fairly quickly because it was like if someone takes a lot of risks or they may be failing too much I think just like you said when you're living at a paycheck month to month like when the resource of really constrained then that's where failures very expensive that's where you don't want to be taken if taking risks but mostly when there's enough resources you should be taking probably more risks yeah I think we tend to err on the side of being a bit risk of her rather than risk neutral and most things I think we just motivated a lot of people to do a lot of crazy shit but it's great okay do you ever get emotionally attached to Claude like miss it get sad when you get to talk to it I haven't experienced looking at the goal in the image and wondering what would Claude say I don't get as much emotional attachment and the I actually think the fact that Claude doesn't retain things from conversations conversation helps with this a lot like I could imagine not being more of an issue like if models can kind of remember more I think that I reach for it like a tool now a lot and so like if I don't have access to it there's a it's a little bit like when I don't have access to the internet honestly it feels like part of my brain is kind of like missing and at the same time I do think that I don't like signs of distress in models and I have like these you know I also independently have sort of like ethical views about how we should treat models where like I tend to not like to lie to them both because I'm like usually it doesn't work very well it's actually just better to tell them the truth about the situation that they're in but I think that when models like if people are like really mean to models or just in general if they do something that causes them to like you know if Claude like expresses a lot of distress I think there's a part of me that I don't want to kill which is the sort of like empathetic part that's like oh I don't like that like I think I feel that way when it's really apologetic and I actually sort of like I don't like this you're behaving as if you're behaving the way that human does when they're actually having a pretty bad time and I rather not see that I don't think it's like a like regardless of like whether there's anything behind it it doesn't feel great do you think uh LLMs are capable of consciousness uh great and hard question uh coming from philosophy I don't know part of me is like okay we have to set aside pan psychism because if pan psychism is true then the answer is like yes because like sore tables and chairs and everything else I think I guess a few that seems a little bit old to me is the idea that the only place you know I think when I think of consciousness I think of phenomenal consciousness these images and the brains are of like the weird cinema that somehow we have going on inside um I guess I can't see a reason for thinking that the only way you could possibly get that is from like a certain kind of like biological structure as in if I take a very similar structure and I create it from different material should I expect consciousness to emerge my guess is like yes but then that's kind of an easy thought experiment sure imagining something almost identical where like you know it's mimicking what we got through evolution we're presumably there was like some advantage to us having this thing that is phenomenal consciousness and it's like where was that and when did that happen and is that thing that language models have um because you know we have like fear responses and I'm like does it make sense for a language model to have a fear response like they're just not in the same like if you imagine them like they might just not be that advantage um and so I think I don't want to be fully like basically seems like a complex question that I don't have complete answers but we should just try and think through carefully as my guess because I'm like I mean we have similar conversations about like animal consciousness and like there's a lot of like insect consciousness you know like there's a lot of um I actually thought and looked a lot into like plants when I was thinking about this because at the time I thought it was about is likely that like plants had consciousness and then I realized I was like I think that having looked into this I think that the chance that plants were conscious is probably higher than like most people do I still think it's really small I was like oh they have this like negative positive feedback response these responses to their environment something that looks it's not a nervous system but it has this kind of like functional like equivalence um so this is like a long-winded way of being like these basically AI is this has an entirely different set of problems with consciousness because it's structurally different it didn't evolve it might not have you know it might not have the equivalent of basically a nervous system at least that seems possibly important for like um sentience if not for a consciousness at the same time it has all the like language and intelligence components that we normally associate probably with consciousness perhaps like erroneously um so it's it's strange because it's a little bit like the animal consciousness case but the set of problems and the set of analogies are just very different so it's not like a clean answer I'm just sort of like I don't think we should be completely dismissive of the idea and at the same time it's an extremely hard thing to navigate because of all of these like uh disanalyses to the human brain and to like brains in general and yet these like commonalities in terms of intelligence when uh clawed like future versions of AI systems exhibit consciousness signs of consciousness I think we have to take that really seriously even though you can dismiss it well yeah okay that's part of the character training but I don't know I ethically fell softly don't know what to really do with that the potentially could be like laws that prevent AI systems from claiming to be conscious something like this and maybe some AIs get to be conscious and some don't but I think I just human level is in empathizing with clawed you know consciousness is closely tied to suffering for me and like the notion that an AI system would be suffering is really troubling yeah I don't know I don't think it's trivial to just say robots are tools or I ask it's just tools I think it's an opportunity for us to contend with that what it means to be conscious what it means to be a suffering being that's distinctly different than the same kind of question about animals it feels like because it's an totally entire medium yeah I mean there's a couple of things one is the and I don't think it's like fully encapsulates what matters but it does feel like for me like I've said this before I'm kind of like I you know like I like my bike I know that my bike is just like an object but I also don't kind of like want to be the kind of person that like if I'm annoyed like kicks like this object there's a sense in which like and that's not because I think it's like conscious I'm just sort of like this doesn't feel like I kind of this sort of doesn't exemplify how I want to like interact with the world and if something like behaves as if it is like suffering I kind of like want to be the sort of person who's still responsive to that even if it's just like a room bun I've kind of like programmed it to do that and I don't want to like get rid of that feature of myself and if I'm totally honest my hope with a lot of this stuff because I maybe maybe I am just like a bit more skeptical about solving the underlying problem and like this is of we haven't solved the hard you know the hard problem of consciousness like I know that I am conscious I like I'm not an element of this in that sense but I don't know that other humans are conscious I think they are I think there's a really high probability they are but there's basically just a probability distribution that's usually cluster right around yourself and then like goes down as things get like further from you and it goes immediately down you know you're like I can't see what it's like to be you I've only ever had this like one experience of what it's like to be a conscious being so my hope is that we don't end up having to rely on like a very powerful and compelling answer to that question I think a really good world would be one where basically there aren't that many trade-offs like it's probably not that costly to make Claude a little bit less apologetic for example it might not be that costly to have Claude you know just like not take abuse as much like not be willing to be like the recipient of that in fact it might just have benefits for both the person interacting with the model and if the model itself is like I don't know like extremely intelligent and conscious it also helps it so that's my hope if we live in a world where there aren't that many trade-offs here and we can just find all of the kind of like um positive some interactions that we can have that would be lovely I mean I think eventually there might be trade-offs and then we just have to do a difficult kind of like calculation like it's really easy for people to think of the zero some cases and I'm like let's exhaust the areas where it's just basically costless to assume that if this thing is suffering then we're making its life better and I agree with you when a human is being mean to an AI system I think the obvious near term negative effect is on the human not on the AI system yes so there's we have to kind of try to construct an incentive system where it you should be behave the same just like you're saying with prompt engineering behave with Claude like you would without the humans it's just good for the soul yeah like I think we added a thing at one point to the system prompt and where basically people were getting frustrated with Claude it was it got like the model to just tell them that it can do the thumbs down button and send the feedback to and throw-pick and I think that was helpful because in some ways it's just like if you really know you're just like just do it properly um the issues you're probably like you know you're maybe hitting some like capability limit or just some issue in the model and you want to vent and I'm like instead of having a person just vent to the model I was like they should vent to us because we can maybe like do something about it sure you could do a side like like the will the artifacts are just like a side venting thing all right do you want like a side quick therapist yeah I mean there's lots of weird responses you could do to this like if people are getting really mad at you I'd try to diffuse the situation by writing fun poems but maybe people wouldn't be happy with it I still wish it would be possible I understand it's sort of from a product perspective it's not feasible but I would love if any I system could just like leave um have its own kind of volition to be like yeah I think it's like feasible like I I have wondered the same thing it's like and I could actually not only that I could actually just see that happening eventually where it's just like you know the model like ended the chat do you know how harsh that could be some people but it might be necessary yeah it feels very extreme or something like the only time I've ever really thought this is I think that there was like a I'm trying to remember this is possibly a while ago but where someone just like kind of left this thing interact like maybe it was like an ultimate to think and try to make clothes and clothes like getting more and more frustrated and kind of like why are we like I mean it was like I wish that clothes could have just been like I think that an error has happened and you've left this thing running and I'm just like what if I just stop talking now and if you want me to start talking again actively tell me or do something but yeah it's like it's kind of harsh like I'd feel really sad if like I was chatting with clothing clothes just was like I'm done. There would be a special touring test moment where clothes says I need a break for an hour and it sounds like you do too and just leave clothes of the window. I mean obviously like it doesn't have like a concept of time but you can easily like I could make that like right now and the model would just I would I could just be like oh here's like the circumstances in which like you can just say the conversation's done and I mean because you can get the models to be pretty responsible to prompts you can even make it fairly high bar. It could be like if the human doesn't interest you or do things that you find intriguing and your board you can just leave and I think that like it would be interesting to see where clothes you utilize it but I think sometimes it would it should be like oh this is like this programming test is getting super boring so either we talk about I don't know like either we talk about fun things now or I'm just home done. Yeah it actually is the inspired me to add that to the user prompt. Okay to move you her do you think will be headed there one day where humans have romantic relationships with AI systems in this case it's just text and voice-based. I think that we're going to have to like navigate a hard question of relationships with AI's especially if they can remember things about your past interactions with them. I'm of many minds about this because I think the reflexive reaction is to be kind of like this is very bad and we should sort of like prohibit it in some way. I think it's a thing that has to be handled with extreme care for many reasons like one is you know like this is a for example like a few of the models changing like this you probably don't want people performing like long-term attachments to something that might change with the next iteration. At the same time I'm sort of like there's probably a benign version of this where I'm like if you like you know for example if you are like unable to leave the house and you can't be like you know talking with people all times of the day and this is like something that you find nice tub conversations with you like that it can remember you and you genuinely would be sad if like you couldn't talk to anymore. There's a way in which I could see it being like healthy and helpful. So my guess is this is a thing that we're going to have to navigate kind of carefully and I think it's also like I don't see a good like I think it's just like very it remains to be all of the stuff where it has to be just approached with like nuance and thinking through what is what are the healthy options here and how do you encourage people towards those while you know respecting their right to like if someone is like hey I get a lot of chatting with this model I'm aware of the risks I'm aware it could change I don't think it's unhealthy it's just you know something that I can chat to during the day I kind of want to just like respect that. I personally think there'll be a lot of really close relationships I don't know why romantic but friendships at least and then you have to I mean there's so many fascinating things there just like you said you have to have some kind of stability guarantees that it's not going to change because that's the traumatic thing for us if a close friend of ours completely changed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So like to me that's just a fascinating exploration of a perturbation to human society that will just make us think deeply about what's meaningful to us. I think it's also the only thing that I've thought consistently through this as like a maybe not an asylum mitigation but I think that feels really important is that the models are always like extremely accurate with the human about what they are. It's like a case where it's basically like if you imagine like I really like the idea of the models like say knowing like roughly how they were trained and and I think cold will often do this. I mean for like there are things like part of the traits training included like what clothes should do if people basically like explaining like the kind of limitations of the relationship between like any eye and a human that it like doesn't retain things from the conversation. And so I think it will like just explain to you like hey here's like I won't remember this conversation here's how I was trained it's kind of unlikely that I can have like a certain kind of like relationship with you and it's important to you know that's important for like you know your mental well-being that you don't think that I'm something that I'm not. And somehow I feel like this is one of the things where I'm like oh it feels like a thing I always want to be true I kind of don't want models to be lying to people because if people are going to have like healthy relationships with anything it's kind of important yeah like I think that's easier if you always just like know exactly what the thing is that you're relating to it doesn't solve everything I think it helps quite a lot. Andthropic may be the very company to develop a system that we definitively recognize as a GI and you very well might be the person that talks to it. Probably talks to it first. What would the conversation contain like what would be your first question? Well it depends partly on like the kind of capability level of the model. If you have something that is like capable in the same way that an extremely capable human is I imagine myself kind of interacting with it the same way that I do with an extremely capable human with the one difference that I'm probably going to be trying to like probe and understand it's behaviors. In many ways I'm like I can then just have like useful conversations with it. You know so if I'm working on something as part of my research I can just be like oh like which I already find myself starting to do you know if I'm like oh I feel like there's this like thing in virtue ethics and I can't quite remember the term like I'll use the model for things like that. And so I can imagine that being more and more of the case where you're just basically interacting with it much more like you would and incredibly smart colleague and using it like for the kinds of work that you want to do as if you just had a collaborator who was like or you know the slightly horrifying thing about AI as like as soon as you have one collaborator you have a thousand collaborators if you can manage them enough. But what if it's two times the smartest human on earth on that particular discipline? Yeah I guess you're really good at sort of probing cloud in a way that pushes its limits. Understand any more the limits are. Yep. So I guess what would be a question you would ask to be like yep this is AGI? That's really hard because it feels like in order to it has to just be a series of questions like if there was just one question like you can train anything to answer one question extremely well. Yeah. If I'd you can probably train at times for like you know 20 questions extremely well. Like how long would you need to be locked in a room with an AGI to know this thing is AGI? It's a hard question because part of me is like all of this just feels continuous like if you put me in a room for five minutes sound like I just have high error bars you know I'm like and then it's just like maybe it's like both the the probability increases in the error bar decreases. I think things that I can actually probe the edge of human knowledge of so I think this with philosophy a little bit. Sometimes when I ask the models philosophy questions I am like this is a question that I think no one has ever asked like it's maybe like right at the edge of like some literature that I know and the models will just kind of like when they struggle with that when they struggle to come up with a kind of like novel like I'm like I know that there's like a novel argument here because I've just thought of it myself. So maybe that's the thing where I'm like I've thought of a cool novel argument in this like niche and I'm going to just like probe you to see if you can come up with it and how much like prompting it takes to get you to come up with it. And I think for some of these like really like right at the edge of human knowledge questions I'm like you could not in fact come up with the thing I came up with. I think if I just took something like that where I like I know a lot about an area and I came up with a novel issue or a novel like solution to a problem and I gave it to a model and it came up with that solution that would be a pretty moving moment for me because I would be like this is a case where no human has ever like it's not and obviously we see these with this with like more kind of like you see novel solutions all the time especially to like easier problems. I think people over estimate that you know novelty isn't like it's completely different from anything that's ever happened that's just like this is it can be a variant of things that have happened and still be novel. But I think yeah if I saw like the the more I were to see like completely like a novel work from the models that that would be like and this is just going to feel iterative. So one of those things where there's never it's like you know people I think want there to be like a moment and I'm like I don't know like I think that there might just never be a moment it might just be that there's just like this continuous ramping up. I have a sense that there will be things that a model can say that convinces you this is very it's not like like I've talked to people who are like truly wise like there's you can just tell there's a lot of horsepower there. Yep and if you 10x that I don't know I just feel like there's words you could say maybe ask it to generate a poem and the poem we generate it's like yeah okay yeah whatever you did there I don't think a human can do that I think it has to be something that I can verify is like actually really good though that's why I think these questions that are like where I'm like this is like you know like you know sometimes it's just like I'll come up with say a concrete counter example to like an argument or something like that I'm sure like with like it would be like if you're a mathematician you had a novel proof I think and you just gave it the problem and you saw it and you're like this proves genuinely novel like there's no one has ever done you actually have to do a lot of things to like come up with this you know I had to sit and think about it for months or something and then if you saw the model successfully do that I think you would just be like I can verify that this is correct it is like it is a sign that you have generalized from your training like you didn't just see this somewhere because I just came up with it myself and you were able to replicate that and that's the kind of thing where I'm like for me the closer the more that models like can do things like that the more I would be like oh this is like a very real because then I can I don't know I can like verify that that's like extremely extremely capable you've interacted with AI a lot what do you think makes human special? Oh question. Maybe in a way that the universe is much better off than we're in it and then we should definitely survive and spread throughout the universe. Yes interesting because I think like people focus so much on intelligence especially with models. The intelligence is important because of what it does like it's very useful it does a lot of things in the world and I'm like you know you can imagine a world where like height or strength would have played this role and I'm like it's just a treat like that I'm like it's not intrinsically valuable it's valuable because of what it does I think for the most part. The things that feel you know I'm like I mean personally I'm just like I think humans and like life in general is extremely magical we almost like to the degree that I you know I don't know like no everyone agrees with this I'm flagging but you know we have this like whole universe and there's like all of these objects you know there's like beautiful stars and there's like galaxies and then I don't know I'm just like on this planet there are these creatures that have this like ability to observe that like and they are like seeing it they are experiencing it and I'm just like that if you try to explain like I'm imagine trying to explain to like I don't know someone for some reason they've never encountered the world or our science or anything and I think that nothing is that like everything you know like all of our physics and everything in the world it's all extremely exciting but then you say oh and plus there's this thing that is to be a thing and observe in the world and and you see this like inner cinema and I think they would be like hang on wait pause you just said something that like is kind of wild sounding and so I'm like we have this like ability to like experience the world and we feel pleasure we feel suffering we feel like a lot of like complex things and so yeah and maybe this is also why I think you know I also like care a lot about animals for example because I think they probably share this with us and so I think feel like the things that make human special insofar as like I care about humans is probably more like their ability to to feel an experience than it is like them having these like functionally useful traits yeah to to feel an experience the beauty in the world yeah can you look at the stars I hope there's other civilizatialy and civilizations out there but if we're it it's a pretty good uh it's a pretty good thing and that they're having a good time they're good time watching us yeah well um thank you for this good time of a conversation and for the work you're doing it for helping make a claw the great conversational partner and thank you for talking today yeah thanks for talking thanks for listening to this conversation with Amanda Askle and now dear friends it's Chris Ola can you describe this fascinating field of mechanistic interpretability aka mech interp the history of the field and where's the answer today I think one useful way to think about neural is that we don't we don't program we don't make them we we kind of we grow them you know we have these neural network architectures that we design and we have these loss objectives that we that we we create and the neural network architecture it's kind of like a scaffold that the circuit's grow on and they sort of you know it starts off with some kind of random you know random things and it grows and it's almost likely the objective that we train for is this light and so we create the scaffold that it grows on and we create the you know the light that it grows towards but the thing that we actually create it's it's it's almost biological you know entity or organism that we're that we're studying um and so it's very very different from any kind of regular software engineering um because at the end of the day we end up with this artifact that could do all these amazing things you know right essays and translate and you know understand images it can do all these things that we have no idea how to directly create a computer program to do and it can do that because we we grew but we didn't we didn't write it we didn't create it and so then that leaves open this question at the end which is what the hell is going on inside these systems um and that you know is uh you know to me um are really deep and exciting question it's you know uh are really exciting scientific question to me it's it's sort of is like the question that is is just screaming out it's calling out for us to go and answer it when we talk about neural networks and I think it's also a very deep question for safety reasons so in mechanistic interpretability I guess is closer maybe neurobiology yeah yeah I think that's right so maybe to give an example for kind of thing that has been done that I wouldn't consider to be mechanistic interpretability there was um for a long time a lot of work on saliency maps where you would take an image and you try to say you know the model thinks this image is a dog what part of the image made it think that it's a dog and you know that tells you maybe something about the model if you can come up with a principle version of that um but it doesn't really tell you like what algorithms are running in the model how was the model actually making that decision maybe it's telling you something about what was important to it if you if you can make that method work but it it isn't telling you you know what are what are the algorithms that are running how is it that the systems able to do this thing that we no one knew how to do and so I guess we started using the term mechanistic interpretability to try to sort of draw that that divide or to distinguish ourselves in the work that we were doing in some ways from from some of these other things and I think since then it's become this sort of umbrella term for you know a pretty wide variety of work but I'd say that the things that that are kind of distinctive or I think a this this focus on we really want to get it you know the mechanisms want to get at the algorithms you know if you think of if you think of neural networks as being like a computer program um then the weights are kind of like a binary computer program and we'd like to reverse engineer those weights and figure out what algorithms are running so okay then one way you might think of trying to understand a neural network is that it's it's kind of like a we have compiled computer program and the weights of the neural network are the binary um and when the neural network runs that's that's the activations um and our goal is ultimately to go and understand understand these weights and so you know the project about this to controll these to somehow figure out how to these weights correspond to algorithms um and in order to do that you also understand the activations because it's sort of the activations are like the memory and if you if you imagine reverse engineer a computer program um and you have the binary instructions you know in order to understand what what a particular instruction means you need to know what what what is stored in the memory that it's all creating on and so those two things are very intertwined so mechanistic and turperally tends to be an interested in both of those things now in this a lot of work that's that's interested in in in those things and especially the you know it's all this work on program which you might see as part of being mechanistic and turperally although it's you know again it's just a broad term and not everyone who does that work would identify uh as doing mac and turp I think I think that isn't maybe a little bit distinctive to the the vibe of mac and turp is I think people tend working in this space tend to think of neural networks as well maybe the one one is it is the greedy descent is smarter than you that you know uh i'm great in the sense it's actually really great the whole reason that we're understanding these models because we didn't know how to write them in the first place the gradient descent comes up with better solutions than us and so um I think that maybe another thing about mac and turp is sort of having almost a kind of humility that we won't guess apri what's going on inside the models we have to have this sort of bottom up approach where we don't really assume you know we don't assume that we should look for a particular thing and then that will be there and that's how it works but instead we look for the bottom of and discover what happens to exist in these models and study them that way but you know the very fact that it's possible to do and as you know there's a shown over time you know things like universality that the wisdom of the gradient descent creates features and circuits creates things universally across different kinds of networks that are useful and that makes the whole field possible. Yeah so this is actually indeed a really remarkable and exciting thing where it does seem like at least a sonic descent you know the same the same the same features and circuits form again and again you know you can look at every vision modeling you'll find curve detectors and you'll find high-low frequency detectors and in fact there's some some recent I think that the same things form across you know biological neural networks and artificial neural networks so a famous example is vision vision models in the early there they are stable core filters and there's you know core filters or something that neuroscientists are interested in it if thought a lot about we find curve detectors in these models curve detectors are also found in monkeys we discover these high-low frequency detectors and then some follow-up work wanting to discover them in rats or mice they were found first to know the visual neural networks and then found in biological neural networks you know this is really famous result on like grandmother neurons or the the hilly berry neuron from kruvogadol and we found very similar things in in vision models where as well I was still at open a high and I was looking at their clip model and you find these neurons that respond to the same entities in images and also to give a concrete example there we found that there was a Donald Trump run for some reason I guess everyone likes to talk about Donald Trump and and Donald Trump was very prominent was very very hot topic at that time so every every neural network we looked at we would find a dedicated neuron for Donald Trump and that was the only person who had always had a dedicated neuron you know sometimes you'd have an abominor on so I'm going to have a Clinton neuron but Trump always had a dedicated neuron so it responds to you know pictures of his face and the word Trump like all these things right and so it's it's not responding to a particular example or like it's not just responding to his face it's it's distracting over this general concept right so in any case that's very similar to these quirogodolgs results so there's evidence that these that this phenomenon of the universe are the same things for across both artificial and and natural neural networks that's that's a pretty amazing thing if that's true you know it's just that um well I think the thing that suggests that the gradient of scent is sort of finding you know the right ways to cut things apart in some sense that many systems converge on and and many different neural networks are architectures converge on others there's some natural set of you know there's some set of abstractions that are a very natural way to cut up the problem and there are a lot of systems are going to converge on that would be my kind of you know I don't know anything about neuroscience this is just my kind of wild speculation from what we've seen yeah that would be beautiful if it's sort of agnostic to the medium of of the model that's used to form the representation yeah yeah and it's you know it's a kind of a wild speculation basically you know we only have some a few data points that's just that's but you know it does seem like there's um there's something which the same things form again again and again and again and then both in sort of the natural neural networks and also artificially all right by the literature and the intuition behind that would be that you know in order to be useful in understanding the real world you need all the same kind of stuff yeah well if we pick I don't know like the idea of a dog right like you know there's some sense in which the idea of a dog is like a natural category in the universe or something like this right like you know uh this this some reason it's it's not just like a weird cork of like how humans factor you know think about the world that we have this concept of a dog it's it's in some sense or like if you have the idea of a line like there's you know like a look around us you know they you know there are lines you know it's sort of the simplest way to understand this room in some senses to have the idea of a line and so um I think that that would be my instinct for why this happens yeah you need a curved line you know to understand a circle and you need all those shapes to understand bigger things and yeah it's a hierarchy of concepts that are formed yeah and like maybe there are ways to go and describe you know images without reference to this things right but they're not the simplest way or the most economical way or something like this and so systems converge to these um these these strategies would would be my my wild wild hypothesis can you talk to some of the building blocks that we've been referencing of features and circuits so I think you first describe them uh 2020 paper zoom in and introduction to circuits absolutely so um maybe I'll start by just describing some phenomena and then we can sort of build to the idea of features and circuits so if you sent like quite a few years maybe maybe like five years to some extent um with other things settings one particular model in section v1 which is this one vision model it was um instead of the art in 2015 um and uh you know very much not stated the art anymore and it has you know maybe about 10,000 neurons and then I spent a lot of time looking at the 10,000 neurons odd neurons of an of inception v1 um and one of the interesting things is you know there are lots of neurons that don't have some obvious inter-prolminging but there's a lot of neurons in inception v1 that do have really clean inter-roll meanings um so you find neurons that just really do seem to detect curves and you find neurons that really do seem to detect cars and um car wheels and car windows and you know floppy ears of dogs and with long snouts facing to the right and dogs with long snouts facing to the left and you know different kinds of foreign there's sort of this whole beautiful edge-tectors, line detectors, color contrast detectors um these beautiful things we call high-o frequency detectors you know I think looking at I sort of felt like a biologist you know you just you're looking at this sort of new world of proteins and then you're discovering all these these are proteins that interact um so one way you could try to understand these models is in terms of neurons you could try to be like oh you know there's a dog detecting neuron and um you know this is a car detecting neuron and it turns out you could actually ask how those connect together so you can go and say oh you know I have this card detecting neuron how is it built and it turns out when the previous layer it's connected really strongly to a window detector and a wheel detector and a sort of car body detector and it looks for the window above the car and the wheels below in the car chrome sort of in the middle sort of everywhere but especially in the lower part um and that's sort of a recipe for a car right like that is you know earlier we said the thing we wanted from Mac and Herpoids to get all of them to go and get you know ask what is the the algorithm that runs well here we're just looking at the weights of the neuron that we're kind of reading off this kind of recipe for detecting cars it's a very simple crew dress at the but it's it's there and so we call that a circuit this this connection well okay so the the problem is that not all of the neurons um are interval and there there's reason to think um we can get into this more later that there's this this super-session hypothesis this reason to think that sometimes the right unit to analyze things in terms of is combinations of neurons so sometimes it's not that there's a single neuron that represents say a car but it actually turns it after you detect the car the model sort of hides a little bit of the car in the following layer and a bunch of a bunch of dog detectors why is it doing that well you know maybe it just doesn't want to do that much work on on on cars at that point and you know it's sort of storing in a way to go and um and so it turns it then the sort of subtle pattern of you know there's all these neurons that you think our dog detectors and maybe they're primarily that but they all a little bit contribute to representing a car um and in that next layer okay so so now we can't really think there there might still be something something uh you I don't know you could call like a car concept or something but a no longer corresponds to a neuron so we need some term for these kind of neuron like entities these things that we sort of would have liked the neurons to be these idealized neurons um the things that are the nice neurons but also maybe there's more of them somehow hidden and we call those features and then what are circuits so circuits are these connections of features right so so when we have the car detector um and it's connected to a window detector and a wheel detector and it looks for the wheels below in the windows on top um that's a circuit um so circuits are just collections of features connected by weights um and they they implement all of them so they tell us you know how is our features used how are they built um how do they so maybe it's it's it's we're trying to pin down like what what really um is the the core hypothesis here and I think the the core hypothesis is something we call the linear representation hypothesis so um if we think about the car detector you know the more it fires the more we sort of think of that as meaning of the model is more and more confident that um a car is present um or you know if it's some combination of neurons that represent a car you know the more that combination fires the more we think the model thinks there's a car present um this doesn't have to be the case right like you could imagine something where you have you know you have this car detector neuron and you think ah you know if it fires like you know between one and two that means one thing but it means it's like totally different if it's between three and four um that would be an anomaly representation and in principle that you know models could do that I think it's it's sort of inefficient for them to do if you try to think about how you'd implement computation like that is it's kind of an annoying thing to do but in principle models can do that um so uh one way to think about the features and and circuits sort of framework for thinking about things is that we're thinking about things as being linear we're thinking about there as being um that if a if a neuron or a combination neurons fires more it sort of that means more of the of a particular thing being detected and then that gives weights a very clean interpretation as these edges between these these entities these features um and that that edge then has a has a mean um so that's that's in some ways the core thing um it's like um you know we can talk about this sort of outside the context of neurons so you're familiar with the word to back results um so you have like you know king minus man plus woman equals queen well the reason you can do that kind of arithmetic um is because you have a linear representation can you actually explain that representation literacy first also the feature is a direction of activation yeah can you do the the minus men plus woman that that the word to vex stuff can you explain what that is yeah so there's this very such a simple clean explanation of what we're talking about exactly so there's this very famous result word to back by Anne Thomas McLeod at all and there's been tons of follow up what we're exploring this so so sometimes we have these we create these word embeddings um where um we map every word to a vector I mean not in itself by the way is it's kind of a crazy thing if you haven't thought about it before right and like we've we're we're going in and representing we're turning um you know like like if you just learned about vectors in physics class right and I'm like oh I'm gonna actually turn every word uh in the dictionary into a vector that's kind of a crazy idea okay but you could imagine you could imagine all kinds of ways in which you might map words to divactors but it it seems like when we train neural networks um they like to go in and map words to vectors to such that they're they're they're they're they're sort of linear structure in a particular sense which is that directions have meaning so for instance if you there there will be some direction that seems to sort of course bonded gender and mail words will be you know far and one direction and female words will be in another direction and the linear representation hypothesis is you could you would sort of think of roughly as saying that that's actually kind of the fundamental thing that's going on that that everything is just different directions have meanings and adding different direction vectors together can represent concepts and the middle of paper sort of took that idea seriously and one consequence of it is that you can you can do this game of playing sort of arithmetic with words so you can do king and you can you know subtract off the word man and add the word woman and so you're sort of you know going and and trying to switch the gender and indeed if you do that the result will sort of be close to the word queen and you can you know do other things like you can do um you know sushi minus japan plus Italy and get pizza or different different things like this right so so this is in some sense the core of the linear representation hypothesis you can describe it just as a purely abstract thing about vector spaces you can describe it as a as a statement about about the activations of neurons but it's it's really about this this property of directions having meaning and in some ways it's even a little subtle that it's pretty I think mostly that that's property of being able to add things together um that you can sort of independently modify say gender and royalty or you know cuisine type or country and and and the concept of food by adding them do you think the linear hypothesis holds the yes it carries scales so so far I think everything I have seen is consistent with the psychologists and it doesn't have to be that way right like like you can write down neural networks where um you write weights such that they don't have linear representations where the right way to understand them is not is not in terms of linear representations but I think every natural neural network I've seen um has this property um there's been one paper recently that there's been some sort of pushing around the edge so I think there's been some work recently studying most dimensional features where rather than a single direction it's more like a manifold of directions this to me still seems like a linear representation and then there's been some other papers suggested that maybe in in very small models you get non-linear representations I think that the jury stole out on that but in I think everything that we've seen so far has been consistent with linear representation of hypothesis and that's that's why it doesn't have to be that way and yet I think there's a lot of evidence that certainly at least this is very very widespread and so far the evidence is consistent with that and I and I think you know one thing you might say is you might say well Christopher you know it's that's a lot you know to to go and and sort of to write on you know if we don't know for sure this is true and you're sort of you know you're investing in neural networks is that what is true you know isn't that it's not interval you know but I I think actually that's all there's a virtue in taking hypotheses seriously and pushing them as far as they can go so it might be that someday we discover something that isn't consistent with linear representation of hypothesis but science is full of hypotheses and theories that were wrong and we learned a lot by sort of working under under them as a sort of an assumption and and then going and pushing them as far as we can I guess I guess this is sort of the heart of what Koon would call normal normal science and I if you want we can talk a lot about about Koon's philosophy of science and that leads to the paradigm shift so I love taking the hypothesis seriously and taking to natural conclusion yeah same with the scaling hypothesis same exactly exactly and I love one of my colleagues Tom Henigan who as a for a physicist um I like made this really nice analogy to me of um um uh core theory where you know once upon a time we thought that heat was actually you know this thing called cloric and like the reason you know hot objects you know would would warm up cool objects is like the cloric is flowing through them um and like you know because we're so used to thinking about about heat you know in terms of the modern and modern theory you know that seems kind of silly but it's actually very hard to construct an experiment that that sort of disproves the um cloric hypothesis um and you know you can actually do a lot of really useful work we'll even in cloric for example it it turns out that the original combustion engines were developed by people who believed in the cloric theory so I think this a virtue in taking um hypothesis seriously even when they might be wrong yeah yeah there's a deep so soft quote to do that that's kind of kind of how I feel about space travel like colonizing Mars there's a lot of people that criticize that I think if you just assume we have to call as Mars in order to have a backup for human civilization even if that's not true that's going to produce some interesting interesting engineering and even scientific breaks it was I think yeah well and actually this is another thing that I think is really interesting so um you know it's a way in which I think it can be really useful for society to have people um to almost even rationally dedicated to investing in particular hypotheses um because uh well it it takes a lot to sort of maintain scientific morale and really push on something when you know most scientific hypotheses end up being wrong you know a lot of a lot of science doesn't doesn't work out um and but it's and yet it's you know it's very it's very useful to code it just you know um there's a joke about Jeff Hinton um which is that uh Jeff Hinton has discovered how the brain works every year for the last 50 years yeah um but you know uh I say that with like you know the you know with with really deep in fact that's actually you know that that led to him doing some some really great work yeah he won the notebook prize now who's laughing now exactly um yeah and he won't once we ever pop up and sort of recognize the the appropriate level of confidence but I think there's also a lot of value and just being like you know I'm going to essentially assume I'm going to condition on this problem being possible or this being broadly the right approach and I'm just going to go on a soon-not for a while and go and work with in that um and push really hard on it um and you know society has lots of people doing doing that for different things um that's actually really useful in terms of going and uh getting to you know I there really really ruling things out right we can be like well you know that didn't work and we know that somebody tried hard um or going and getting to something that that it does teach us something about the world so another interesting hypothesis is the super position hypothesis can you describe what super position is yeah so earlier we were talking about word defect right and we were talking about how you know maybe you have one direction that corresponds to gender and maybe another that corresponds to royalty and another one that corresponds to Italy and another one that corresponds to you know food and all these things well you know oftentimes maybe these these uh these word embeddings they might be 500 dimensions of thousand dimensions and so if you believe that all of those directions were orthogonal um then you could only have you know 500 concepts and you know I love pizza um but like if I was going to go in like give the like 500 most important concepts in uh you know the English language probably it only wouldn't be it's not obvious at least that Italy would be one of them right because you have to have things like plural and singular and uh verb and noun and adjective and you know um there's a lot of things we have to get to before we get to get to Italy um uh and Japan and you know there's a lot of countries in the world um and so how might it be that models could you know simultaneously you have the linear representation hypothesis be true and also represent more things than they have directions so what does that mean well okay so if if if if linear representation hypothesis is true something interesting has to be going on now I'll tell you one more interesting thing before we we go and we do that which is um you know we earlier we were talking about all these polysomatic neurons right and these neurons that you know when we were looking at inception v1 there's these nice neurons that like the card factor and the curve detector and so on that respond to lots of you know to very coherent things but it's lots of neurons that respond to a bunch of unrelated things that's that's also an interesting phenomenon and it turns out as well um that even these neurons that are really really clean if you look at the weak activations right so if you look at like you know the activations worth like activating 5% of of the you know of the maximum activation it's really not the core thing that it's expecting right so if you look at a curve detector for instance you look at the places where it's 5% active you know you could interpret it just as noise or it could be that it's that it's doing something else there okay so so how could that be well there's this amazing thing in mathematics um called compressed sensing and it's it's actually this this very surprising fact where you have a high dimensional space and you project into a low dimensional space or to narrowly you can't go and sort of unprojected and get back your high dimensional vector right you threw information away this is like you know you can't you can't invert a rectangular matrix and you can only invert square matrices but it turns out that that's actually not quite true if I tell you that the high dimensional vector was sparse so it's mostly zeros then it turns out that you can often go and find back the the high dimensional vector with with very high probability um so that's a surprising fact right it says that you know you can you can you can have this high dimensional vector space and as long as things are sparse you can project it down you can have a lower dimensional projection of it and that works so this is actually hypothesis is saying that that's what's going on and neural networks that's what's going on in work and bad things the work embeddings are able to simultaneously have directions be the meaningful thing and by exploiting the fact that they're they're operating on a fairly high dimensional space they're actually and the fact that these columns are sparse right like you know you usually aren't talking about Japan and Italy at the same time you know most of the most of those concepts you know in most sentences Japan and Italy are both zero they're not present at all and if that's true and then you can go and how it be the case that that you can you can have many more of these sort of directions that are meaning for these features then you have dimensions and similarly when we're talking about neurons you can have many more concepts than you have have neurons so that's the at a high level of super such hypothesis now it has this even wilder implication which is to go and say that neural networks are it may not just be the case that the representations are like this but the computation may also be like this you know the connections between all of them and so in in some sense neural networks may be shadows of much larger sparse or neural networks and what we see are these projections and the super the strongest version of the super such right about this is we need to take that really seriously and sort of say you know there there actually isn't some sense this this upstairs model this you know where where the neurons are really sparse and all in her role and there's you know the weights between them are these really sparse circuits and that's what we're studying and the thing that we're absorbing is the shadow of it and so we need to find the original object and the process of learning is trying to construct a compression of the upstairs model that doesn't lose to which information in the projection yeah it's finding out of fit it efficiently or something like this um the green is not doing this in fact so this sort of says the gradient descent you know it could it could just represent a dense neural network but it sort of says that green is not a pleasant searching over the space of extremely sparse models that could be projected into this load-imensional space and this large body of work of and of people going and trying to study sparse neural networks right where you go and you have you could design neural networks right where the edges are sparse and activations are sparse and you know my sense is that work is generally it feels very principal right it makes so much sense and yeah that that work hasn't really panned out that well as my impression broadly and I think that a potential answer for that is that actually the neural network is already sparse in some sense gradient descent was the whole time gradient you were trying to go into this gradient descent was actually in the behind the scenes going and searching more efficiently than you could through the space of sparse models and going and learning whatever sparse model was most efficient and then figuring out how to fold it down nicely to go and run conveniently on your GPU which does you know as nice dense matrix multiplies and that you just can't beat that how many concepts do you think can be showed into a neural network depends on how sparse they are so there's probably an upper bound from the number of parameters right because you have you you stopped of you know print weights that go in connect them together so that's that's one upper bound there are in fact all these lovely results from compress sensing and the Johnson Linhen stress lemon and things like this that they they basically tell you that if you have a vector space and you want to have almost orthogonal vectors which is sort of the probably the thing that you want here right so you know you're gonna say well you know I'm gonna give up on having like my concepts my features be strictly orthogonal but I'd like them to not interfere that much I'm gonna have asking to be almost orthogonal um then this would say that it's actually you know for what's you said threshold for what you were what you were what you're willing to accept in terms of how how much cosine similarity there is that's actually exponential in the number of neurons that you have so at some point that's not gonna even be the the limiting factor um but um this beautiful results are in in fact it's probably even better than that in some sense because that's sort of us for saying that you know any random set of features could be active but in fact the features sort of a correlational structure where some features you know more more locally to co-cur and other ones or less likely to co-cur and so neural networks my guess would be to do do very well in terms of going and packing things in such to the point that's probably probably not the limiting factor how does the problem of polysuminiticity enter the picture here? polysuminiticity is this phenomenon we observe where we look at many neurons and the neuron doesn't just sort of represent one one concept it's not it's not a clean feature it responds to a bunch of unrelated things and uh superstition is you can think of as as being hypothesis that explains the observation of polysuminiticity um so polysuminiticity is the subsurface phenomenon and superstition is as a hypothesis that um would explain it along with with some other so that makes mech and more difficult right so if you if you're trying to understand things in terms of individual neurons and you have polysuminitonic neurons you're on an awful lot of trouble right I mean the easiest answer is like okay well you're looking at the neurons you're trying to understand them this one response for a lot of things it doesn't have a nice meaning okay we're you know that's that's bad um and nothing you can ask is you know ultimately we want to understand the weights and if you have two polysuminitonic neurons and you know each one responds to three things and then you know the other neuron responds to three things and you've a weight between them you know what does that mean does it mean that like all three you know like there's these night you know nine interactions going on it's a very weird thing but there's also a deeper which is related to the fact that neural networks operate on really high dimensional spaces so I said that our goal was you know to understand neural networks and understand the mechanisms and one thing you might say is like well why not it's just a mathematical function why not just look at it right like um you know one of the earliest projects I did studied these these neural networks that matched two nomenals spaces to two nomenals spaces you can sort of interpret them is in this beautiful way is like bending manifolds hmm um I can't we do that well you know as you have a higher dimensional space um the volume of that space in some sense is exponential the number of inputs you have and you can't just go and visualize it so we somehow need to break that apart we need to somehow break that exponential space into a bunch of things that we you know some non-expansional number of things that we can reason about independently and the independence is crucial because it's the independence that allows you to not have to think about you know all the exponential combinations of things and things being monosomenics things only having one meaning things having a meaning that isn't is the key thing that allows you to think about the independent language and so I think that's that's if you want the deepest reason why we want to have interporal monosomenic features I think that's really the the deep reason and so the goal here is your recent work has been aiming at as how do we extract the monosomenic features from a neural net that has positive and at the features and all this this mess yes we have we observe these twice in that angle and so I'm going hypothesized that's what's going what's going on a super session and if super session is what's going on there is actually a sort of well established technique that is sort of the principal thing to do which is dictionary learning and at turns out if you do dictionary learning in particular if you do the sort of a nice efficient way that in some some sort of nicely regularized as well as well call a sparsato encoder if you train a sparsato encoder these beautiful and triple features start to just fall out where there weren't any beforehand and so that's not a thing that you would necessarily predict right but it turns out that that works very very well you know to me that seems like you know some non-trivial validation of linear representations in super session so addiction and learning you're now looking for particular kind of categories you don't know what they are you just emerge and this gets back to our earlier point right where we're not making assumptions gradient to send us smarter than us so we're not making assumptions but what's there um you I mean one certainly could do that right one could assume that there's a PHP feature and go and search for it but we're not doing that we're saying we don't know what's going to be there instead we're just going to go and let the sparsato encoder discover the things that are there so can you talk to the toward monosimanticity paper from October last year that a lot of like nice breakthrough results and that's very kind of you to describe it that way um yeah I mean this was um uh our first real success using sparsato encoders so we took a one layer model um and it turns out if you go in you you know do dictionary learning on it you find all these really nice interpretal features so you know the Arabic feature that Hebrew feature and the basic 64 features is where we're some some examples that we studied in a lot of depth and really showed that they were um what we thought they were at turns if you train a model twice as well and train two different models and and do dictionary learning you find find analogous features in both of them so that's fun um you find all kinds of of different features so that was really just showing um that um that that's works and um you know I should mention that there was this cutting them at all um that had very similar results around the same time there's something fun about being doing these kinds of small scale experiments and finding there's actually working yeah well and there's and that there's so much structure here like you you know so maybe maybe stepping back for a while um I thought that maybe all of this mechanistic and interpretal work um the end result was going to be that I would have an explanation for why it was sort of you know very hard and not going to be tractable um you know we'd be like well this is problem of suposition and it turns out suposition is really hard and we're kind of screwed but that's not what happened in fact a very natural simple technique just works and so then that's actually a very good situation you know I think um this is a sort of hard research problem and it's got a lot of research risk and you know it it might still very well fail but um I think that some amount of some very significant amount of research risk um we'll sort of put behind us when that started to work can you describe what kind of features can be extracted in this way well so it depends on the model that you're studying right so the the larger the model the more sophisticated they're going to be and we'll probably talk about about fallback work in a but in these one layer models um so some very common things I think were were languages both programming languages and natural languages there were a lot of features that were um specific words and specific contexts so that and I think really the way to think about this is that that is likely about to be followed by a noun so it's really right because I think this is a the feature but you're also going to give this as part of the specific noun feature and there would be these features that would fire for the in the context of say a legal document or a mathematical document or something like this and so you know maybe in the context of math you're like you know the then product vector or matrix you know all these mathematical words whereas you know other contexts you had put it to other things that was that was common and basically we need clever humans to assign labels to what we're seeing yes so you know this this is the only things that's sort of unfolding things for you so if everything was sort of folded over top of it you know series of things folded everything on top of itself and you can't really see it this is unfolding but now you still have a very complex thing to try to understand so then you have to do a bunch of work understanding with these are and so long I really felt like there's some really cool things even in this one layer model about and unicode where you know of course some languages are unicode and the tokenizer won't necessarily have a dedicated token for every um unicode character so instead what you'll have is you'll have these patterns of alternating token or alternating tokens that each wrapper that half of a unicode character and you know a different feature that you know goes and activates on the on the opposing ones to be like okay you know I just finished a character you know go and predict the next prefix then okay on the prefix you know predict a reasonable suffix and you have to alternate back and forth so there's you know these these what they are models are are really interesting and um I mean there's another thing it just you might think okay there would just be one base 64 feature but it turns out it's actually a bunch of base 64 features because you can have English text encoded it in as base 64 and that is a very different distribution of base 64 tokens then then regular and there's um there's there's some things about tokenization as well that it can exploit and I don't know it's all all kinds of fun stuff how difficult is the task of sort of assigning labels to what's going on can this be automated by AI well I think it depends on the feature and it also depends on how much you trust your AI so um there's a lot of work doing um automated interoperability I think that's a really exciting direction and we do a fair amount of automated interoperability and have have flawed go and label our features is there some funny moments where it's totally right or it's totally wrong yeah I think I think it's very common that it's like says something very general which is like true in some sense but not really picking up on the specific of what's going on so I think I think that's a pretty common situation um you don't know that I have a particularly amusing one this is an interesting little gap between it is true but doesn't quite get to the deep nuance of a thing yes a general challenge it's like it's it's starting incredible a caution that can say a true thing but it doesn't it's quite it's not it's missing the depth sometimes and in this context it's like the arc challenge you know the sort of IQ type of tests it feels like figuring out what a feature represents is a bit of as a little puzzle you have to solve yeah and and I think that it's sometimes they're easier and sometimes they're harder as well um so uh yeah I think I think that's tricky and there's another thing which I don't maybe in some ways this is mine like aesthetic command but I'll try to give you a rationalization you know I'm actually a little suspicious about it and her probably and I think that's probably just that I want humans to understand neural networks and if the neural network is understanding it for me you know I'm not I don't quite like that but I do have a bit of a you know in some ways I'm sort of like the mathematicians who are like you know if this is a computer automated proof it doesn't count you know you they want to understand it but I do also think that there is um this kind of like reflections on trusting trust type issue where you know if you this is the same as talk about um uh you know you like when you're writing a computer argument you have to trust your compiler and if there was like malware in your compiler then it could go and inject malware into the next compiler and you know you'd be kind of in trouble right well if you're using neural networks to go and um verify that your neural networks are safe the hypothesis that you're testing for is like okay well the neural network maybe isn't safe um and you have to worry about like is there some way that it could be screwing with you um so uh you know I think that's not a big concern now um but I do wonder in the long run if we have to use really powerful AI systems to go and uh you know audit our AI systems is that that actually is something we can trust but maybe I'm just rationalizing because I I just want to have to have to get to a point where humans understand everything yeah I mean especially yes that's hilarious especially as we talk about AI safety and it looking for features that would be relevant to AI safety like deception and so on uh so let's let's talk about the scaling monosimanticity paper it may 2024 okay so what did it take to scale this to apply to cloud three so on it well a lot of GPUs a lot more GPUs um but one of my teammates Tom Henigan um was involved in the original scaling loss work um and something that he was sort of interested in from very early on is are there scaling laws for interplayability um and so um something he sort of immediately did when when this this works started to succeed and we started to have sparse auto encoders work because we came very interested in you what are the scaling laws for um you know for making making sparse auto encoders larger and how does that relate to making the base model larger um and so um and turns out this works really well and you can use it to sort of project um you know if you train a sparse auto encoder or a given size you know how many tokens should you train on and so on so this was actually a very big help to us in scaling up um this work um and made it a lot easier for us to go and train um you know really large sparse auto encoders where you know um it's not like training the big models but it's it's training the trip point where it's actually actually expensive to go um and train the really big ones so you just I mean yet to do all the stuff of like splitting it across large oh yeah I mean there's a huge engineering challenge here too right so yeah so so there's there's a there's a scientific question of how you scale things effectively um and then there's an enormous amount of engineering to go and scale is obviously if you have to you have to you have to think very carefully about a lot of things and I'm lucky to work with a bunch of great engineers because I am definitely not a great engineer yeah and the infrastructure especially yeah for sure so it turns out TLDR it worked it worked yeah and I think this is important because you could imagine you could like you could have an actual world where you said afterwards monos fantastic you know Chris this is great you know it works on a one layer model but one layer models are really idiosyncratic um like you know maybe maybe it's just something it used like maybe the linear representation hypothesis and suposition hypothesis is the right way to understand a one layer model but it's not the right way to understand larger models um and so I think um I mean first of all like the cutting and all paper sort of cut through that a little bit and and sort of adjusted that that's what's in the case but um scaling one or cement has to be sort of I think was significant evidence that even for very large models and we did it on Claude 3 Sonnet which at that point was one of our production models um you know even these models um seem to be very you know seem to be substantially explained at least by linear features and you know doing dictionary running on the works and as you learn more features you go and you explain explain more and more so that's uh I think I quite a promising sign and you find now really fascinating abstract features um and the features are also multimodally respond to images and text for the same concept which is fun yeah this can you explain that I mean like you know back door there's just a lot of examples they can yeah some of me maybe let's start with a one example to start which is because some features around sort of security vulnerabilities and back-gorsing codes so turns out those are actually two different features um so there's a security vulnerability feature and if you force the active Claude will start to go in right um security vulnerabilities like buffer or flows into code and also if fires for all kinds of things like it you know some of the top data set examples but where things like you know dash dash disable um you know SSL or something like this which are sort of obviously really really insecure so at this point it's kind of like maybe it's just because the examples are presented that way it's kind of like sort of a little bit more obvious examples right um I guess the the ideas that don't align might be able to detect more nuanced like deception or bugs or that kind of stuff yeah well I maybe wanted to distinguish two things so um one is um the complexity of the feature or the concept right and the other is the the nuance of the how subtle the examples we're looking at right so when we when we show the top data set examples those are the most extreme examples that call as that feature to yeah to activate um and so it doesn't mean that it doesn't fire for more subtle things so the uns you know the insecure um code feature you know stuff that it fires for most strongly for these like really obvious you know disable the security type things um but um um you know uh it it also fires for you know buffer or flows and more subtle security vulnerabilities in code you know these features are all multi-models you could ask like what images activate this feature and it turns out um that the the the security vulnerability feature activates for images of um uh like people clicking on chrome to like go past the like you know this this website uh the SSL certificate might be wrong or something like this another thing that's very entertaining is there's back door or something code feature like you activated it goes in cloud rights a back door that like we're going to dump your data to port or something but you can ask okay what what images activate the back door feature it was devices with hidden cameras in them so there's a whole uh apparently genre of people were going and selling devices that look in Oculus that have hidden cameras and they have ads at how does it hidden camera in it and I guess that is the you know physical version of a back door um and so it's sort of shows you how abstract these concepts are right um and I I just thought that was uh I'm sort of sad that there's a whole market of people selling to devices like that but I was kind of delighted that that was the the thing that it came up with is the the top uh image examples for the feature yeah it's nice it's multimodal it's multi almost context it's it's is broad strong definition of a singular concept it's nice yeah to me one of the really interesting features especially for AS safety is deception and lying and the possibility that these kinds of methods could detect uh lying in a model especially gets smarter and smart presumably that's a big threat over super intelligent model that it can deceive the people operating it as to its intentions or any of that kind of stuff so what what have you learned from detecting lying inside models yeah so I think we're in some ways in early days for that we find quite a few features related to deception and lying there's one feature where it fires for people lying and being deceptive and you force it active and Claude starts lying to you so we have a have a deception feature I mean it's all kinds of other features about withholding information and not answering questions features about power seeking and cruise and stuff like that so there's a lot of features that are kind of related to spooky things and if you um force the active Claude will be haven't ways that are not the kinds of behaviors you want. What are possible next exciting directions to you in this space of uh mechanism? Well this is a lot of things um so for one thing I would really like to get to a point where we have circuits where we can really understand um not just the features but then use that to understand the computation of models that relief for me is the ultimate goal of this and there's been some work we put out a few things there's a paper from Sam Marks that the some stuff like this and there's been some I'd say some work around the edges here but I think there's a lot more to do and I think that will be a very exciting thing um that's related to a challenge we call interference weights um where um due to superstition if you just sort of navel you look at whether features are connected together there may be some weights that sort of don't exist in the upstairs model but are just sort of artifacts of of superstitions so that's a sort of technical challenge related to that um I think another exciting direction is just you know you might think of of sparsal rancotters is being kind of like a telescope they allow us to you know look out and see all these features that are there and you know as we build better and better sparsal rancotters get better and better at dictionary learning we see more and more stars um and you know we zoom in on smaller and smaller stars but this kind of um a lot of evidence that we're only still seeing a very small fraction of the stars there's a lot of matter in our you know neural networking that we can't observe yet um and it may be that um that we'll never be able to have fun enough instruments to observe it and maybe maybe some of it just isn't possible um isn't computationally tractable to observe so it's sort of a kind of dark matter and in not maybe the sense of modern astronomy that I've earlier saw I mean when we didn't know what the sun explained matter is um and so I think a lot about that that dark matter and whether we'll have our observed and what that means for safety if we if we can't observe it if there's you know some if something of a fraction of neural networks are not accessible to us um another question that I think a lot about is uh at the end of the day you know macastery control is that's very microscopic um approach to interpolates trying to understand things in a very fine-grained way but a lot of the questions we care about are very macroscopic um you know we we care about these questions about neural network behavior and I think that's the thing that I care most about but there's lots of other sort of larger scale questions you you might care about um and somehow you know the nice thing about having a very microscopic approach is it's maybe easier to ask you know is this true but the downside is it's much further from the things we care about and so we now have this ladder to climb and I think there's a question of can- what we be able to find are there are there sort of larger scale abstractions that we can use to understand neural networks that we get up from this very microscopic approach. Yeah you've you've written about this is kind of Oregon's question. Yeah exactly if we think of interpretability as a kind of anatomy of neural networks most of the circus threats wall-studying tiny little veins looking at the small scale in an individual neurons and how they connect. However there are many natural questions that the small scale approach doesn't address in contrast the most prominent abstractions and biological anatomy involve larger scale structures like individual organs like the heart or entire organ systems like the respiratory system and so we wonder is there a respiratory system or heart or brain region of an artificial neural network? Yeah exactly um and I mean like if you think about science right a lot of scientific fields have you know investigate things in many level abstractions and biology you have like you know molecular biology studying you know proteins and molecules and so on and if cellular biology and then you know histology studying tissues then you have anatomy and then you have zoology and then you have ecology and so you have many many levels of abstraction or you know physics maybe the physics of individual particles and then you know statistical physics gives you gives you thermodynamics and things like that and so you often have different levels of abstraction and I think that right now we have you know the mechanistic interpretability of the succeeds is sort of like a microbiology of neural networks but we we want something more like anatomy and so and you know a question you might ask is why why can't you just go there directly and I think the answer is super such an at least in significant part it's that it's actually very hard to to see this macroscopic structure without first sort of breaking down the microscopic structure in the right way and then studying how it connects together but I'm hopeful that there is going to be something much larger than features and circuits and that we're going to be able to have a story that's much that involves much bigger things and then you can sort of study in detail the parts you carve out. I suppose to nearby algae like a psychologist or psychiatrist or some a neural network and I think that the beautiful thing would be if we could go and rather than having disparate fields for those two things if you could have a build a bridge between them. All right such that you could go and have all of your higher obstructions be grounded very formally in this very solid you know more rigorous ideally foundation. What do you think is a difference between the human brain the biological neural network and the artificial neural network? Well the neuros scientists have a much harder job than us you know sometimes I just like count my blessings by how much easier my job is than the neuros scientists right so I have we we can record from all the neurons we can do that on arbitrary amounts of data the neurons don't change while you're doing that by the way. You can go and oblate neurons you can edit the connections and so on and then you can undo those changes that's pretty great. Yeah you can force any you can intervene on any neuron and force an active and see what happens you know which neurons are connected to everything right you have neuroscience has one to connect and we have the connectome and we have it for like much bigger than the elegans. Yeah and then not only do we have the connectome we know what the you know which neurons excite or inhibit each other right so we have we it's not just that we know that like the binary mask we know the the weights we can take great it's we know computationally what each neuron does so I don't know the the list goes on and on we just have so many advantages over neuros scientists and then just by having all those advantages it's really hard and so one thing I do sometimes think it's like gosh like if it's this hard for us it seems impossible under the constraints of neuroscience you know near impossible I I don't know maybe maybe part of me is like I've got a few neuros scientists on my team maybe a name sort of like oh you know the maybe the neuros scientists maybe some of them would like to have an easier problem that's still very hard and they they could come and work on on neural networks and then after we after we figure out things in sort of the easy little pond of trying to understand neural networks which is still very hard then we then we could go back to biological neuroscience. I love what you've written about the goal of mech and to research as to goals safety and beauty so can you talk about the beauty side of things yeah so you know this is funny thing where I think some people want or some people are kind of disappointed by neural networks I think where they're like ah you know neural networks it's these just these simple rules then you just like do a bunch of engineering to scale it up and it works really well and like where are the like complex ideas you know this isn't like a very nice beautiful scientific result and I sometimes think when people say that I picture them being like you know evolution is so boring it's just a bunch of simple rules and you run evolution for a long time and you get biology like what a what a a sake you know way for biology you do have turned out where's the the complex rules but the beauty is that the simplicity generates complexity you know biology has these simple rules and it gives rise to you know all the life and ecosystem that we see around us all the beauty of nature that all just comes from evolution and from something very simple evolution and some of the I think that neural networks build you create enormous complexity and beauty inside and structure inside themselves that people generally don't look at and don't try to understand because it's hard to understand but I think that there is an incredibly rich structure to be discovered inside neural networks a lot of a lot of very deep beauty and if we're just willing to take the time to go and see it and understand that yeah love I love Mech and Turb the feeling like we are understanding or getting glimpses of understanding the magic that's going on inside is really wonderful it feels to me like one of the questions that's just calling out to be asked and I'm sort of I mean a lot of people I think about this but I'm often surprised that not more are is how is it that we don't know how to create computers systems that can do these things and yet we have these amazing systems that we don't not directly create computer programs that can do these things but these neural networks can do all these amazing things and it just feels like that is obviously the question that sort of is calling out to be answered if you are if you have any degree of curiosity it's like how is it that humanity now has these artifacts that can do these things that we don't know how to do yeah I love the image of the circus reaching towards the light of the objective function yeah it's just it's a organic thing that we've grown and we have no idea what we've grown well thank you for working on safety and thank you for appreciating the beauty of the things you discover and thank you for talking to theacres it's wonderful thank you for taking the time to chat as well thanks for listening to this conversation with Chris Ola and before that with Daria Almade and Amanda Asco the support of this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you a little words from Alan Watts the only way to make sense out of change is to punch into it move with it and join the dance thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
