 Three, two, one. Brian Green lives in German. How are you, sir? Good. Thank you. How are you? Doing this, man. I've been enjoying your work for many, many, many years. So I really appreciate you coming in. Thank you. I appreciate that. And I just started your new book. And has it going? It's going well. It's hasn't confused the shit out of me yet, but I know it's coming. It will be coming. No doubt. No doubt. With all your work. So the beginning of time, the beginning of the universe, to the end. That's essentially what you're summarizing. Yeah, that's the backdrop to the entire narrative of the book. I basically want the reader to get a feel for the whole thing. How it started, how things like you and me rise up, how consciousness emerges, issues of free will, and whether we have it, and then on to the future, what's going to happen to us and the world and the universe as time elapses to the far, far future? It's, I'm just getting to the part where you're talking about how entropy and evolution sort of co-mingle to create life. And when you think of entropy, a lot of people think of something dissolving into chaos. Yeah, exactly. But that's not necessarily the case. It's only part of the story. I mean, entropy kind of gets a bad rap, right? It's the thing that you want to avoid, but somehow the laws of physics don't allow you to avoid it. It's this disintegration. It's this decay. It's this drive toward this order. And that's kind of true. But the reality of the situation is more subtle because overall entropy needs to go up. But that doesn't mean there can't be little pockets of order that form along the way. And in fact, the universe is incredibly clever. Stars, the ubiquitous feature of the heavens, they are pockets of order that naturally form, but as they form, they increase the entropy in the surroundings. So the net entropy goes up, even though this beautiful, orderly bright object in the sky appears. And it's only because of the appearance of stars that the universe is an interesting place. Without stars, the particles of the universe would just disperse the universe would get bigger and bigger, colder and colder, and that would be it. There wouldn't be any structure in the universe. It wasn't for the force of gravity. Stars themselves, just the fact that they exist, is very strange. That you have this thing in ours is fairly small, right? It's a million times larger than Earth. Yeah. And it's going to burn for billions of years. And it's just hovering there. Yeah. And it creates all the life. Yeah. Literary is responsible for all the life. Yeah. And when they supernova, that creates the actual ingredients for life, which is even more strange, like you can't have biological carbon-based life if it's not for a star exploding. Yeah. I mean, we often in a poetic way said that we are made of star stuff. Yeah. That's a star. I was saying, but you can also say that we are made of, you know, nuclear refuse, right? We are the detritus that the deaththrows of a star puts out into the universe and it rains down on planets. And at least on one such planet, that stuff comes together in yield's life. So it is a cycle. I mean, I want to sound like the lion king here, but you know, it's really what it is. Well, what I'm so interested in about getting into your book is the fact that you are sort of detailing all these steps that have to take place in order for all this life in order for this universe to be what it is and then where it's going to go. Yeah. Exactly. And the remarkable thing and sort of the main point at some level is that, look, we're special entities. We can think we can reflect, we have emotions. But ultimately, you and I and everybody else were just bags of particles that are governed by physical law. And so there's this continuity between the stuff of the world, the inanimate stuff of the world, the inanimate stuff of the heavens, and us. We all come from the same fundamental ingredients and the same fundamental laws. Now, some people find that that gives them, I don't know, a sense of desperation, a sense of, or not special, a sense that somehow the universe is pointless or meaningless. But, you know, my view on this is it's spectacular that we're made of the same stuff that makes up this bottle of water or any of the wonderful statues you have on this desk. Because that means that how remarkable that collections of particles can do what we do. And I think that's really the way of looking at the continuity. We don't need to be endowed with some special quality by some external entity. You don't need that. Particles can do miraculous things. And that is the message that I think you can draw from a more complete understanding of where we came from and where we're going. That the fear of death and the attitude of the finite life being insignificant, that like what is the point? It's sort of existential angst that many of us struggle with, right? That's something that you touch upon really early on. This thing that makes us unique is that we know that we're going to die. Yeah. Yeah. That to me is the vital distinguishing feature of our species. You know, we can reflect on the past. We can think about the future and recognize that we're not going to be here in the future, at least for some period of time. And it's an idea and it's powerful motive any influences. One that has been explored throughout the ages. Otto Ranc was one of the early disciples of Freud who ultimately broke with Freud developed this thesis that our awareness of our own mortality is one of the driving factors in what we do. And then when I was, I don't know, it was in my 20s or 30s. I read a book by a guy named Ernest Becker called Denialet Death. I'm going to be a very hurt of this book. It was big in the 70s and one actually the Pulitzer Prize in the 70s. And it's a wonderful distillation of this way of thinking about why we humans do what we do. And in many ways, in my own book, the one that's coming out actually today, until the end of the time, it's extending this notion that Becker developed in Denialet Death. But now seeing it in a cosmological setting. Because it's not just we that are going to die. It's every structure in the universe is going to disintegrate in time. Our our best theory suggests to us that even protons, the very heart of matter, their quantum processes that in the far future will ensure that every proton disintegrates falls apart into its constituent particles. And that point, there's no complex matter around at all. What, what, what, what, what timeline are we talking about? Well, pretty, pretty big, long timeline. In fact, I'd like to use a metaphor to try to give you a feel for the times involved. I like to use the Empire Stapling. And imagine that every floor of the Empire Stapling represents a duration 10 times out of the previous floor. So like on the ground floor, it's like one year, first floor 10, you're second floor 100 and so forth. So you're going exponentially far in time as you climb up the Empire Stapling. And in that scheme of things, everything from the Big Bang until today, you're about at the 10th floor, 10 to the 10 years, 10 billion years. And as you go forward, you are looking at things very far in the future and to answer your question, we think, and I underscore think because we're now at the speckled event of our theoretical ideas, protons will decay roughly and say by the 38th floor. So 10 to the 38 years into the future. So we can relax for a little bit. You can relax for a little bit. But here's the thing, the amazing thing, obviously, is it sounds tripe, a time is relative, right? So any duration that seems long, it's only long by comparison to another duration. And on, say the scale of the entire Empire Stapling up to say 10 to the 100 years into the future, which is what the peak would represent, 10 to the 38 years is like less than the blink of an eye. I mean, it's nothing on those scales. So you start to have to be careful whether you're intuition. If you're willing to entertain the kind of fantastic long timescales that you necessarily need to, if you're going to think about the very far future. Is there speculation as to what happens when protons do ceased to exist? Yeah. We anticipate that all complex structure will fall apart. So if there are any stars left over, we believe that by the 14th floor, most stars will have used up their nuclear fuel. There will be dark embers just sort of, you know, smokey out there in the cosmos. But if they're still hovering around by the 38th floor, they will all just dissipate into their particulate ingredients. So it's hard to imagine. Pass say floor 38. That there's going to be any life for any mind or any complex astronomical structures out there in the universe. So the window within which the universe as we know it exists is kind of small when you think about it in terms of the entire cosmic timeline. So impossible to understand the actual span of it because it is so long, but yet so small. Like in the human mind. Yeah. It's very hard to hold these durations in mind. I mean, I don't, I don't feel like I've been thinking about this stuff for a long time. I don't feel like I have an intuition for the durations that we are talking about. In fact, the Empire State Building, that little analogy helps me to sort of give some relative sense of when things of interest will happen in the universe. But you know, we're good at understanding days, weeks, months, years, the times of, you know, conventional experience. We have no basis for understanding the universe over these scales that we've never experienced. You know, and that's true not only for time, it's also for space, right? I mean, we have very good intuition about everyday phenomena. I mean, if I have to take this bottle of water, I throw out a tube, you'd catch it. You know, where to put your hand, you wouldn't have to calculate its Newtonian trajectory to figure out where the water is going. But if I was to do the same thing with electrons, you don't have a neither-do-eye quantum intuition about the wave functions and the probabilities that govern how a particle-like electron behaves. And that's simply because we were unfortunately, or fortunately, born as big creatures relative to the scales of quantum mechanics. And because of that, our intuition was never under any evolutionary pressure to understand how electrons behave. In fact, I like to say those of our forebears, wondering around the Africans of Anna, who started to think about electrons in quantum mechanics, they got eaten, right? They're the ones who's genes didn't propagate onward. And therefore, those of us who are the beneficiaries of the survival of our ancestors were good at understanding Newtonian physics, but were not good at understanding anything else about the deep reality of the world. Do you anticipate that someday in the future, whatever is next after human beings will be able to understand these concepts? Because if you stop and think about what human is, we've only really been this for X amount of 100,000 years. That's right. And it's a good question. And it's a tough one. I'd like to imagine that as we get ever better at creating virtual worlds, virtual reality, or whatever augmented reality, whatever version of that kind of technology takes over in the far future, we might be able to experience these distinct realms in such a powerful way that our innate intuition may begin to shift, to change, so that we grasp the quantum realm, the way we grasp Newtonian physics. I can at least imagine that as a possibility. What it would take to actually get there and whether our species will ever last long enough to actually have that kind of an impact on our intuition. I don't know, but it's all about experience and survival. We have been programmed by evolution not to understand the true nature of the world. We've been programmed by evolution to survive. And those are two radically different propositions because you don't need to know the true nature of reality to survive. It's a distinct attribute. And one that is not necessarily one that has any survival value to understand black holes or the big bang or general activity or quantum mechanics or entropy or thermodynamics. These qualities we develop as we go forward and try to understand the world go beyond mere survival and figure out things that excite us, but it's not something which obviously has any survival value. But may someday. What's interesting is also how relatively recently people have been pondering these ideas in a sort of a quantifiable way. We can write things down and express it with other scientists and try to figure out who's right and who's wrong in terms of these calculations. But human beings when did we really start pondering the scope of the universe? Pretty recently. I mean, if you think about the beginnings of modern physics, you know, you can start with Galileo, you can start with Newton, but in any event we're talking on the order of hundreds of years. And the amazing thing in hundreds of years, we've gone from a complete lack of understanding about how anything in the world actually works to the development of Newton's equations where you can make fantastically accurate predictions about solar clips as our lunar or clips as our emotions of the planets and so on. And then, you know, a couple hundred years after that, we migrate from that understanding, which is basically an encapsulation of the patterns that we can all discern with the naked eye. We develop a whole new body of physical law called quantum mechanics, which is so completely counterintuitive, which describes the world in terms of qualities that we don't ever see with the naked eye, but nevertheless, we can use the math to make predictions and the predictions are born out by experiment. And that progression only took, say, a couple hundred years. And that's where we've gotten. So it's kind of spectacular that, you know, we beings who are just coming of age here in the Milky Way galaxy can sit down with a piece of paper and a calculation of pencil. And we can figure out magnetic properties of particles like electrons to ten decimal places. That's shocking. I mean, it's stunning. And it's something that I think all of us should be very proud of that our species have been able to accomplish that. Somehow, I know that I don't think I'm responsible. I feel proud. Yeah. I don't feel like any of my people are at home. You've contributed your part. No, it really is a collective effort. And that's a beauty of science. In the end of the day, it's not that most scientists are ever going to be remembered. You stop someone in the street and ask them to name a scientist. Yeah, they may say Hawking, they may say Einstein. That's kind of it, I think, for most people. And I don't think that's a bad thing per se because it's not about the personalities or the people that have pushed the frontiers of understanding. It's the fact that we've got this body of insight that continues to grow and can just to allow us to manipulate and understand the natural world. And I think that's really what it's all about. Don't you think that there are some personalities like yourself like Feynman, like Neil deGrasse Tyson, that because of their personality, because they're sort of their charismatic people. It actually makes more people intrigued about these possibilities and makes more people attracted to the ideas. Yeah, no doubt. And I think that's a vital point because without that impetus from outside the traditional educational system, I don't think we would have the kind of interest in science that I can feel growing in the world around us. The important thing in the educational system is that we teach toward examination. We teach toward assessment. And if you want to figure out how to flatten a kid's interest in these just teach some stuff and tell them you're going to be tested on this on Tuesday. You're going to have to spit about everything that you've learned. So I find it kind of heartbreaking, the way in which so much intrinsic interest in these ideas, you can see it a five or six year old, right? I mean, I like to say we begin as little scientists. We're exploring the world but trying to figure things out. And then we go into the educational system. And it's not by malice. It's just by the nature of how we teach in the current approach to educational philosophy that so many kids wind up seeing these ideas as a burden. Something I don't want to have to spend time learning about parts of the sale or how to balance reactions. I see with my own kids, I've got 15 year old son at 12 year old daughter and all they are motivated by is next Wednesday's quiz. And I'm like, hey, these ideas are they're kind of exciting. They're kind of wonderful. Like, no, no, dad, dad, dad. I just want to know enough so I can do well on the quiz. And once the quiz is over, they just sort of leave the ideas behind. When did these ideas become a tractor to you? Well, I was, I don't know, not unusual for a scientist but unusual, I think, in the spectrum of kids in the world because at five or six years old, I was just captivated by mathematics. Really? Yeah, five or six. Definitely. Yeah, my dad, my dad was not an academic. My dad was a composer. He was a Vaude villain. He was a, he was a comedian. You know, he was in the early days, we go around the country and with a harmonica group and a stage show that that's what he did. You know, he liked to say that he was an SPHD, a sword park high school dropout. You know, so at, at tenth grade, he just hit the road. But he loved scientific ideas. So he taught me the basics of arithmetic when I was about five years old. And then I would ask him to set me problems and he'd give me these 30 digit numbers by 30 digit numbers. I'd write the man in big construction paper and I'd spend the weekend just calculating away on these huge, you know, arithmetic problems of no interest to anybody on planet earth. But to me, the fact that you could learn a little piece of math and then do something that nobody had ever done before, that was exciting to me as a kid and that's really what got me going. So you chose the right path. Clearly. Yeah, you know, personality, whatever it is that it's right to do. Well, you always wonder about that. I don't know if you wonder, you know, I was wondering, how can you not? What, what would have happened if X would have transpired instead of Y? And in fact, I have to say, when I graduated college, I had sort of a period of, I don't know, depression is too strong a word for it. But a period of what have I done? I went to college. I could have studied all the great ideas of the world and all I did was get a technical education where I could solve Schrodinger's equation and solve Einstein's equations and I felt like, wow, have I just like squandered the greatest educational opportunity that one could have ever had because I was so completely focused on just trying to understand physics and math and math. How did you get past that? Well, I was lucky. I was given a second chance. I won a scholarship to go to England, Oxford and it ostensibly was to study physics. But when I got there, I realized that I was completely free to do whatever I wanted to do at that point and so I took a year to study literature. I went to the physics classes so I was sort of showing up, but I wasn't focused on it at all and instead I was focused, I got an England, it's a tutorial system. So I got a tutor which is somebody at the college that sets you assignments and you write papers. You literally go in and you read your paper out loud. It's not something we just turned it in and it's graded. So it's a very personal experience. You write something and you're actually delivering it to this individual that is going to help you in your educational journey. And so that's what I did for a year. At the end of the year, I kind of had to myself, okay, I've got it. I understand now what it would mean to study these other subjects and I sort of felt like, I'll be able to do this on my own if I continue to be excited about it and I went back to physics with vengeance and basically in that second year, completed my doctorate in that year and moved on from there. So this time that you took off this year, we need to really take it off, but you changed paths. Yeah, how beneficial was that for you? Do you think it helped you sort of appreciate what your original subject of interest was as well? Yeah, hugely so because, you know, it's funny. It's the flip side of something I often encounter with people that are interested in science, but don't know the math. And they always say, or some say, I'm never really going to understand this body of science because I don't know the mathematics. And I try to convince them, look, at some level, that's true. If you really want to do research in the general theory of relativity, you've got to learn differential geometry in all the tensor calculus, but if you are really interested in the ideas, you really can grasp the ideas without the technical background. So I try to demystify something that can seem impenetrable because you have an entered the field. And I think the same thing happened to me in reverse for the more humanistic explorations. It had this aura of of grandeur that I was unable to penetrate because I'd never really immersed myself in the ideas. And by spending a year in those ideas, it didn't diminish them in any way, but I felt like it brought it back down to Earth as another journey toward truth, another pathway toward insight. And one that you don't have to have a degree in. You don't have to know the ins and outs of the academic version of that subject to understand it and grasp it and spend some time thinking about it. So you think that for people studying anything, particularly those studying science and mathematics, very rigid disciplines, do you think that they all could benefit from sort of expanding their education into philosophy or art or something that uses your mind in a different way? Yeah, some. There are some people in the physics and mathematics community who are so intensely focused that it would almost be a shame to pull their attention away from the deep dive that they're going to do for the rest of their lives and the contributions that they're going to make and have made are substantial and exciting. But for I think for many others and certainly for me, I mean, look, I as most people do, but not all, but I've learned early on that I'm not going to be an Albert Einstein. You know, I can make contributions and I have had contributions to it fails like string theory and cosmology, but they're never going to be at the level of shattering our understanding of the world, things that people are going to talk about 500 years from now that's unlikely. And I think for somebody like that who's able to make contributions but pulling away from the technical work is not going to extract some vital insight into the nature of the world that otherwise wouldn't be discovered. I think there is great value in doing exactly what you're saying because by broadening your perspective on what the work you're doing is actually revealing. It's part of the human quest for understanding and seeing it as an isolated discipline where it's all about the next equation and the better unified theory or the deeper understanding of the big bang to see that as isolated from the human quest for understanding. I think to menace the work that we as physicists actually do. Was that a part of your initial ambition? Yeah, one is something that we just rocked the world. Yeah, well to go back to the comment that you made before about we being the only species that knows that we're going to die. I think part of that instills in many people and certainly I see it in my own life even though at the time that I was making various decisions I wasn't literally thinking about these kinds of issues of mortality but how do you deal with that recognition of the impermanence of your own life? Well, as part of it is a symbolic kind of immortality. You create something that will last. You create something that will have such impact that it will stick around for a long, long period of time. So I think yes, I mean part of my motivation in doing physics was not merely to get the next decimal place in this or that physical quantity described in the natural world. It was to try to have some kind of insight that would rock our understanding of the world and have reverberations that would echo out for many many years to come. That's interesting. Did that torture you somewhat? I mean, does that something that would haunted you in your head all the time? Not really, but an ultimate ambition. But ultimate ambition, yeah, for sure. And you know, look, I think when when you're doing any work whatsoever, the day-to-day, the moment to moment is a grind. You know, I don't know how you find it in the work that you're doing but if I'm working on a research project, even if, in principle, the ideas are grand and wonderful embold, the moment to moment is calculating away. It's trying to figure out that equation. It's putting an equation on a computer. I mean, it is not sexy. It is not something that has that glorious quality that you might ultimately describe when you're finished and you look back and you think about the implications of your work. The moment to moment of almost anything that you do is so I think that's ultimately what is the driver of whatever you're doing in your life, the moment to moment. But yeah, there was certainly a part of me that would have a desire, a hope that the work would reverberate in a powerful way. I think that's true for most physicists that notion that you can sort of sit at a table and think and change the way we understand reality, the way Einstein did, the way Schrödinger did, the way Neil's board. But what percentage of people have that revelation? Yeah, I think it's pretty few and far between. And so what else is sort of just contributing? Contributing. And then occasionally someone, exactly, some light bulb goes off, just sort of powerful new insight and you're like, okay, everything has suddenly changed. That's so exciting, though. And it's what keeps you going. It keeps you going. You know, to be the person who has the light bulb. Yeah, but I tell my students, you know, and especially young students who come in there are still trying to figure out what they want to do, if you're not satisfied with just contributing. If you're not satisfied with being part of the journey, but not the person at the head of the breakthroughs, it's probably not the field for you because it's so unlikely because it's not just brainpower. It's thinking of the right questions, it's thinking of things in the right orientation. It's being at the right place at the right time with the right DNA that somehow is a tune to the question that's being asked. So it's not even fully under your control. It's not sort of a matter of, you know, exercising your mind and building up the muscles of the brain in such a way that you are the strongest person to contribute to this in this idea. It's luck, it's timing. It's being there when the questions being asked and you happen to see the way forward. That's it's so interesting to me that there's so many people working on all this stuff and that the average person that doesn't contemplate quantum physics or any of these equations, we have no idea it's going on. Yeah. And that this all this work that's so critical to our understanding of what the universe really is, with the very fiber of the universe itself. Yeah. All this is going on and most people are just sort of they're reaping the residual benefits of it. Yeah. But they're just wandering around and not knowing. Yeah. Usually so. In fact, there's a number that's quoted that quantum mechanics is responsible for something like 35% of the gross national product. So it's like it's in a very concrete way. Now the problem with that number is I recently looked it up to find the source of it. So I sort of went online and checked it out. And apparently I'm the source of this number. And I assure you that I've not done a calculation that really fully justifies this. But roughly speaking, you know, anything that has an integrated circuit is the result of beneficiary of quantum insights. So we use this stuff every moment of our technological lives. And yet as you say, for the most part, most of us don't have a deep understanding of the reality that's responsible for the gadgetry that the science has given rise to. And it's a strange quantum mechanics is an utterly strange reality. Two strange. Yeah. I've tried many, many times, tried to understand right, whether it's Sean Carroll's books or yours or any ones. Yeah. It's just it doesn't get in right. And again, it goes back to, you know, our brains just weren't under pressure to think quantum mechanically. But I assure you, you give me a couple of hours. I mean, books are one thing because it's a one sided conversation. But you give me a couple of hours in a back and forth. And I will absolutely get you to a place where you appreciate and have a sense of what these ideas really are telling us about the nature of the world. Here's the thing that I've always wanted to ask someone like you. What do you think was happening before the big bang? Yeah. It's a it's a deep question and a subtle one. And there's sort of two ways that I'd like to think about that question. One as it could be that the big bang was an interesting event, but not the first event in the totality of reality. It could have been the first event that sparked the expansion of our part of space. But it could be that there's a grander realm of space within which we set as a small part and that grander realm may have been there for a far longer period of time. It may have experienced its own big bangs, maybe a collection of big bangs that may extend infinitely far into the past. So it could be that the answer to the question of what happened before the big bang is, a lot of other big bangs or a lot of other quantum events that were taking place in a larger landscape of reality than we have direct access to. However, another answer is that the very question may not make as much sense as the words seem to suggest. We know how to parse that sense. We know what it means to talk about the moment before the big bang because we know how to talk about the moment before your birth or the moment before the Civil War or the moment before any event that happened the world. We fully understand the meaning of that kind of sentence. But it could be that when it comes to the big bang, the sentence actually doesn't mean anything. It could be that the big bang was the place where time itself started and Hawking himself had a wonderful analogy to get this across. I'll dress it up a little bit. Imagine you're walking on planet Earth and you pass by something and you say, hey, can you point me in the direction of North? I want to walk in the North with direction. They point you, continue to walk you pass by somebody else. Say, hey, which way is further north and they point you in that direction? But when you get to the North Pole and talk to somebody there and say, hey, how do I go further north? They look at you and say, whoa, that question doesn't mean anything because this is where North begins. There's no notion of going further north than the North Pole and it could be that that spatial metaphor applies to time. Talk about a billion years ago, or a 10 billion years ago, but if you go to a 13.8 billion years ago, the big bang, that may be where time started and you can't go further back in time than the very origin of time itself. That freaks me out. Yeah. See that? That's one that gets in your head and you would mean beginning of time. Yeah. Why would time have a beginning? Good. And it could be, it could be the time is an emergent quality of reality. I give you an analogy, boy, what I mean by that is, we all know what temperature means intuitively. Something's hot, you feel it's something's cold, you feel it, your body understands those concepts. What physics has done is it's gone deeper into the concept of temperature and revealed that it is nothing but the average motion of the particles making up the environment. So if the molecules are moving really quickly, you've got a hot environment. If the molecules are really moving slowly, it's a cold environment. So temperature emerges from the motion of particles. So if you have like one particle, you can't really talk about it being hot or cold because you need a conglomerate, you need a glomerate of particles to be able to talk about their average motion. And in that sense, temperature is this emergent idea that rests upon more fundamental ideas, the molecules and atoms that make up reality. Maybe that's true of time. Maybe time as we know it is a property that only makes sense in certain environments when there's enough stuff arranged in the right patterns. But fundamentally, maybe there are atoms or molecules of time, which when not arranged in the form that we are familiar with, don't yield time as we know it. Time itself may be a quality of the world that exists here in this environment, but doesn't even apply in other environments that are configured radically differently. That's a heavy one. Yeah, that's a heavy one. We would also say heavy one is what caused the big bang. Yeah, why would something smaller than the head of a pin? Yeah. Become everything that we see in the cosmos. Yeah. So there are ideas for the answer to that question. Look, all of this is tentative because it's very hard to do measurements that go all the way back to the beginning. We have astronomical observations that we need to be sure are compatible with the predictions of our theories in so forth. So we is good scientists do what needs to be done to try to test these ideas. But the idea that I think most physicists are cosmologists by into at the moment is that gravity can have two manifestations. The usual form of gravity that you and I know about is the attractive version. You drop something toward the earth and it moves downward because the earth and the object pull on each other. That's the ordinary gravity that we experience every day of our lives. But Einstein's equations actually allow gravity to also be repulsive. It can push outward as opposed to just pulling inward. And this is something that we have never experienced because the gravity created by a rocky object like the earth is always the attractive variety. The gravity created by the sun again, compact object is always the attractive variety. But Einstein's math shows that if you don't have a rocky object that's isolated in space but rather energy that is uniformly spread through a region of space that that kind of entity yields repulsive gravity. Why is that important to your question? If the very early universe that little tiny head of a pin that you're talking about, if it was filled with a uniform bath of this energy, we call it the infloton field. The name doesn't matter. But if it was filled with that energy, it would have been subject to repulsive gravity. What does repulsive gravity do? Pushes everything apart, causes everything to rush outward. So the bang of the big bang may have been a spark of repulsive gravity operating with a tiny region of space that pushed everything apart. And this concept of repulsive gravity is just theoretical. We observed any sort of element in the universe that it is theoretical. But it's at a level of understanding that I think most physicists would say causes it to migrate into the camp of established understanding of how gravity works. So number one, Einstein's equations have now been tested over and over again in a whole variety of circumstances. The detection of gravitational waves just a couple of years ago is like the crowning triumph of Einstein's math. The hundred years ago the math says there should be ripples in the fabric of space a hundred years later. We finally detect ripples in the fabric of space. So we are very comfortable with any prediction that comes out of Einstein's mathematics. And right in the mathematics is the prediction of what I was just described. You've got uniform energy and a region, repulsive gravity. The other thing is we currently witness that the expansion of the universe is speeding up, not slowing down. Since the 1920s everybody thought that yes the universe is expanding but it will slow down over time. Why? Because gravity pulls things back together. You throw an apple upward. It doesn't go up faster and faster. It goes up slower and slower because the earth's gravity pulls it back. Everybody thought that would apply to the universe as a whole. It's expanding but expanding ever slower. The observations in 1998 culminated in 1998 which won the 2011 Nobel Prize showed that the distant galaxies are moving way ever more quickly. The expansion of space is speeding up over time. It's accelerating. How do we explain that? The best explanation we currently have is repulsive gravity. We believe even today the universe is suffused with the bath of energy. We call it dark energy. We believe it's uniformly going through space. I like to think of it almost like a as a Turkish sauna. It's like the steam filling the sauna, this energy filling space. And that repulsive gravity we believe is responsible for the observations that the distant galaxies are rushing way faster and faster over time. So it's circumstantial but the case for repulsive gravity is quite strong. And what would have caused it to coal? What would have caused it to compress initially? Why would all that matter be in this tiny less than the pin sized object? So I have no idea. Nobody else on planet earth has any real idea. But we do have theories. One of the theories suggests that in the very early universe it was a highly chaotic environment. Very hot with all the fields fluctuating wildly up and down. And the idea would be that if you wait long enough, we're it's hard to know what wait means in this environment but don't press me on my definition of time back then. Just sort of intuitively. If you wait long enough on rare occasions the energy will just happen to flatten out in a region become uniform and then that region explosively inflates. Gross large. So imagine you're looking at a pot of boiling water. The surface is of course widely undulating up and down. But if you wait long enough, very long time since you've never seen it neither of I, there will be a little patch on the surface of that boiling water that flattens out. Why? That only means that the water molecules happen for an instant to be moving in just the right way to keep that little patch of water from wildly bubbling. It will happen it's a rare but if you wait long enough it will occur. Similarly, the widely undulating fields in the early universe, if you wait long enough, a patch will flatten out. You get the uniform energy, plug it in times times equations, that region explosively inflates. And I mean explosively it can go from size that's much less than an atomic diameter to larger than the observable universe in far less than a blink of an eye. In 10 to the minus 30, 10 to the minus 35 seconds. That's how powerful Rebels of gravity can be. That is so baffling. Yeah. So before that, before this happens, you just have in this theory, you just have all of this energy sort of randomly interacting with other energy in the universe with no physical objects. Yep. Yep. It's just could have been forever. That could, in fact, that's the main point. There's nobody who is hanging around looking at their watching. Good God, when is this big bang going to finally happen? So so you can have this cosmological pre-show. You can have it last as long as you like. The only thing that you need to happen is that sooner or later a region flat ends out and then the cosmological show begins. And if we're looking at this model of the universe being this infinite universes, yeah, with different characteristics and different qualities to them, this could be happening throughout infinity. Yeah, all over the place. Yeah. And in fact, this so-called inflation cosmology is the technical name for the subject says that it says that it's quite likely that this explosive inflation of the region that we currently inhabit, it was just one of many such events. And therefore there are other far-flung regions throughout this larger cosmological landscape where things have also inflated, but the details can be different. The physical details can differ from what we are familiar with. And the differences can be small, temperature differences in one part of space versus another or they can be far more significant, even the particles that make up that other realm may be different from the particles that make up our realm. Their masses can be different. Their charges can be different. Their fundamental physical features can be different. So out there in that wider cosmological landscape, it can be the wild, wild west of realities. And they don't have to worry about proton deterioration. There may be realms in which they don't have to worry about protons falling apart. The wild, the really crazy idea is that if you're very careful mathematically and analyzing these theories, you realize that there have to be realms out there that duplicate hours as well. Many can be different, but there have to be versions of this reality that are also instantiated occur out there in other realms. So you come to these crazy sounding sci-fi sounding ideas that you and I are having this conversation out there in other distant realms. And infinite number of times, infinite number of times, and more of a small difference can also arise in these other realms where maybe our positions are interchange at the table or maybe your name is Joe Green and I'm Brian Rogan or there's like strange realities that can be taking place. And this is not an overworked theorist imagination. This is the careful, dispassionate analysis of the mathematical equations. Now I should say there are some physicists who see this implication and say, whoa, you guys have fallen off the deep end. Your theory has imploded because any theory that predicts that kind of a wealth of realities that are kind of untestable because they're so far away that we will never interact with them. That's a kind of theory that we have been trained to avoid, to exercise. However, the more forward thinking I like to describe us, physicists say, hey, math has proven to be a very valuable guide over the course of hundreds of years. And if this is where the math is taking us, it's at least worthy of our attention to investigate it fully and possibly come to the conclusion that this is how reality actually behaves. Jesus. That's the weirdest one. The weirdest one. It's like when people talk about intelligent life, someone in the universe that you're out there or the version of you or infinite versions of you. Yeah, and it can be disturbing. Like what do you mean by you? If there are many of you's out there, each of whom has an equal claim on being you because they've had the same experiences. They have the same memories. And maybe have made infinite variations in the decisions that you've made through your life. That's right. So you could meet a Brian Green your age somewhere out there in the universe that's made a right choice. Or the wrong one. Exactly. Become a gambling addict. Yeah, you know, it's like they start to accept us. We've got, we've got like spock and evil spock. You know, the one that had the little beard on. Right. So this is going to be a little beard and version of me. It go out there. Yeah. So yeah, you know, and the thing I want to stress is this sounds cookie. Yeah. And the danger of cookie sounding ideas and physics is that there are people who then jump off for it and say, well, if that's possible, then then this is possible. Maybe I can with my mind, you know, effect what other people are. Yeah. So there's all sorts of crazy ideas that can be inspired by the weird insights of modern physics. And you've really got to keep straight what's real and what's ridiculous. Yeah, that's a problem. Right. When people start using, especially if there are articulate, let's start using scientific lingo to describe things that are very unscientific. Sort of like what the bleep. Yeah. Like what the bleep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that was one of those movies where a lot of people, like, there was all this quantum talk and yeah. Dr. Quantum was in it. Yeah. The whole cartoon is like particles and waves. And they're like, they're science behind this. But then at the end of it really, it was something that was created by someone who runs a cult, who believes they're channeling someone who's like a thousand year old alien like that whole ramp thing. Yeah. Well, let me tell you, if you have a moment, please. So a couple years ago, I was in middle of a big project. In fact, I described this in the end of the book. So you'll get to this little anecdote if you choose to carry on reading. I was in the middle of a big project and speaking opportunity came in and I didn't properly vet it. You know, the money looked good and looked like a fine thing and I signed off on it. And then a few days before I'm going, I realized it's to go to talk to Judy Zebra Knight, who channels romptha the 35,000 year old memorian sage. And I said to, you know, the folks who should have been checking in on this, like the lecture agent, I can't go. And they're like, hey, Brian, it's tomorrow. It's too late to back out. You know, it's like Jesus Christ. You know, so I look at some videos online and I see her on like the Murr Griffin show where, you know, she channels romptha on live television. I don't know what year this was. You know, she snaps her head forward and goes back. She changes her voice. It becomes like something between the queen and Yoda. You know, there's a weird place that she's old. You know, hello being and she's talking to Murr Griffin. You know, he's talking about like an airplane. She goes, what does airplane? You know, it's that kind of thing. Anyway, so I go, you know, and I show up. And the first thing I see is they're all these people walking around a grassy field, but they're arms out like this. And I'm like, you know, can they see you're a, and I get closer. They're all blindfolded. And I'm saying that what what is going on here, and they describe that each person has a card around their neck where they've written down their life's dream. And an exact copy of that card has been put out on this big field. And they have to feel their way toward the matching card. And if they succeed, this shows that this goal or desire is going to come to pass. Oh boy. You know, and I'm saying to those guys, like, so how's it going? He goes like, really good. You know, one person found their card. You know, in the last few months, like, you know, the odds of probability of that happening are kind of not unreasonable, but that's all that this is. And then they take me to the blindfolded archers. Oh, geez. Yeah. You know, so they're taking bow and arrow, and they're firing at these targets. And like, man, I'm like, standing way back on this kind of thing. And they ask me, you know, do you want to try it? And I was like, you know, there's a photographer that's come along. I'm like, no, I'll avoid that. And then they introduce me to this woman who is able to predict the next card in a, in a shuffle deck. And, you know, so she would pull out this card and she'd say, okay, it's going to be seven of clubs. And it's like a three of spades. And then the next one is a seven of diamonds. And you go, oh, well, there's the seven that I was talking about, you know, one card before. You know, so this is crazy circumstance where, um, and then I go, I go to give my talk. Okay, because that's why I was there after all. This was just like the preamble they were showing me what they do. I walk into this barn. And I across the threshold of barn, and they all give me a standing ovation. And I'm like, okay, that's appreciated. But like, why are you giving me a standing ovation? And I go in and I start to give my talk. And I, and I say to them straight out, what I've seen here is nuts. Okay, you know, I say, you know, if you're going to try to predict next cards in a deck, you know, one hour or four times, we'll get the suit. One hour, 13 times we get the rank. There's nothing in there, but the pure probabilistic laws of mathematics, you know, they rise up and give me a standing ovation. And I say, it's appreciated. But why are you applauding? I'm telling you that you're wasting your time. And they applaud me again. And I'm like, this is like so totally weird. But then I go to the book signing, I finish my talk and the book signing these people, they come up with me and they, they talk real soft and say, there's a lot of crazy stuff that's happening in this place. But we come here because we feel that there's something else in the world and we want to be around like-minded individuals that are searching for the deeper truth. So thank you for calling out the silliness that's happening here. But we'll come here anyway and spend our money because we want to be part of the journey. And I have to tell you I had a degree of sympathy for them because I get the motivation. I mean, as a physicist, what we do is we are revealing strange features of the world. So I get the urge, I get the desire, that the problem is that the methodology that's being employed is something that will never take you closer to the truth. However much you may feel that you're among like-minded individuals. So I get the motivation. I get this sensation, I get the urge, but it's tragic that these individuals feel that this kind of an undertaking is a pathway that will take them toward the deeper truth. And let me just finish up. So after this, they take me to the dinner. And the dinners and imagine at the top of the Hill, and that's where Judy, I'm probably going to get suit for this conversation, but really? I don't know. But I've never talked about it. Yeah, they're quite litigious. Are they? Yeah. No, they're definitely are. Anyway, there's just a one person's opinion. They take me to the mansion at the top of the Hill. And that's where she is. She doesn't come down and actually participate in the talk. She's like watching it on close circuit television up in the mansion. And I walk in and she hugs me. But it was too goddamn long of a hug. You know, I'm saying, it was like, and she was like, thank you. It was like this big emotional thing. And I was like, I don't get it, but I think that's the way that she brings people into the fold and gets them to spend the big bucks to enter on this so-called journey toward truth, where she's channeling this, you know, made up, thick titious sage at somehow people buying to. Is this all still going on? It was just a couple of years ago. So I imagine it is. I imagine if she's really channeling it. Yes. We're just missing that's right. You know, that would certainly rewrite every rule of reality, every law of physics that I understand. Would that be less weird than the big bang itself? You know, no, I tell you why. I tell you why. It's a PCC. When it comes to the big bang, I can sit down with the mathematics that I understand well. And I can follow the deductive chain of reasoning that gets us to some of these strange implications that we're talking about multiple big banges or the realities and so forth. When it comes to channeling a 35,000 year old sage, I don't know what the hell that even means. I don't understand the physical processes by which that could possibly happen. I don't understand how there could have been a being of the sort that she's channeling alive 35,000 years ago because it doesn't have any agreement with the archaeological record. You know, so there's a vital distinction between weirdness that emerges from careful mathematical analysis and weirdness that emerges from an overworked imagination that possibly sees a business model whereby a lot of money can be brought in if you can get people to buy into your vision of how the world works. Well, it's sort of like what they do is they they curate ideas and then they run them through their sort of filter of woo woo. Yeah, right? Exactly. And then they distributed in a very palatable way that attracts people. That movie. Yeah. I tell a story I've told this before. So I apologize to people who heard it. There was a friend of mine at the Comedy Store had a friend that I don't know her name, but she came to the Comedy Store and she was so happy and I'm like she's like I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. She goes because I found the secret. And now that I know about the secret, I'm going to be married, I'm going to be this. I'm going to have this fulfilled life. I'm going to reach my dreams and I'm really excited about that. And so you know, at the time I had just seen the movie and then I was just starting to understand the criticism of the movie. I was reading all these, you know, the accounts here. We're scientists. We're breaking down all the things that were wrong. And I didn't dash your dreams. I just was like wow. Okay. And then I saw a year later. The outside of another one of my shows, a different comedy club. And I said hey, how you doing? It's like, things are just not going the way I thought. I thought because of the secret that everything would be grave in my dad is still a pain in the ass. And you know, when that you know, he's moved in with me, he doesn't have any money. And I can't establish a good relationship. But I don't have the job that I wanted. I don't understand because I've been using the secret. I think about it every day. And I said, here's my take on this. If you talk to someone who's very successful and you say to them, hey, how did you get very successful? And they say, I thought about it all the time. I have a vision board. I took that photo of the house that I wanted. I put it in the vision board. That became my house. I took this idea. I want a beautiful wife. I want a family. I want sports cars. And this and that. And now I have those things because the mind is a powerful tool. And the mind can create reality. But you're just talking to someone who is successful. How many people thought like that and nothing happened? Right. I bet millions. Yeah. I bet there's so many, you have a, you have a bias in successful users. Those are the ones that you're talking to. And just because of the fact that they've been able to have these extraordinarily successful lives while visualizing these things does not mean that visualizing these things creates an extraordinarily successful life. You have to think and you have to act and you have to do. Right. And there's trial and error and there's a lot of lessons to be learned. But if you wanted to simplify it at the end once you're successful and boil it down to a philosophy that you could sell a course on. Yeah. That's what it would be. Yeah. That's exactly right. Look, there's nothing wrong with visualizing success. But that is not the causal ingredient that will yield the success. The thing that comes to mind is, you know, I don't know if they do it any longer. But there was certainly a time when Olympic athletes would be taught to visualize, say, jump and over that high boss, you know, and they'd run through the whole thing. But that's not all that they were doing. They were doing, you know, 10 hours a day of training that integrated this visualization as part of the training program. Yeah. You know, so, so it's kind of tragic when people buy into these, these crazy ideas. And I have to tell you, when they were making that film, they called me to be in it. And I think it was the director, one of the producers, I was on the phone with, and you know, they were describing what they were doing. And I probed sufficiently hard. And some of my friends did not probe sufficiently hard. And we're in the film and we read it. But I probed sufficiently hard. And I said, look, what you're doing to me sounds really dangerous. It sounds like a really bad thing to be doing. And they took offense in that call back then. A year after the film came out, it was either the director produced, I can't remember the gentleman's name called me up. And he said, I want to apologize to you. You were absolutely right. I have finally realized what a bad film this was to be involved in. And I completely regret it. So that, I don't think is the point of view of, you know, the, you know, the, romped the school of enlightenment, which is behind this or at least part of what was behind this. But at least the director or the producer, whoever it was, saw the light and realized that this is not the kind of information that you want to put out in the world because it can change people's lives in a very negative way. You know, I think you're a comparison to Olympic athletes is very good because the Olympic athletes are visualizing something that they already do. You know, what there's a great benefit and visualizing for athletics, for martial arts, for a lot of different things. Visualizing success, visualizing potential problems, failures of your process, how you're going to adjust on the fly, all those things are great because then when things do take place in real life situations, you've already prepared for them. You know the path, right. That's what that's all about. I agree that. And in fact, I have to tell you know, in one of the chapters, later chapters of the book, I describe theories about why it is that we, for instance, tell fictional stories. I mean, could there be any evolutionary value in two individuals telling each other a story that they both know as false, that they know has no connection to the world around them, but yet we've been doing that since the emerges of language. And there are these interesting evolutionary scenarios in which what you're saying is brought to bear in that unfamiliar context. We tell stories because it's the mind's way of rehearsing for the real world, but it's a way of rehearsing for the real world. That's completely safe. So you can go on all sorts of crazy journeys to the underworld, up into the clouds. You can engage in all sorts of battles. You can fight gods or demigods. All these things can take place within your imagination. So you're completely safe and yet when you encounter something that's analogous to the stories that you've been told or retold or embellished or told to others through other accounts, your brain is more attuned to respond in a beneficial way because it's not as novel as it would have been had you not been engaged in this fictional account of telling stories. So there's value in visualizing. There's value in telling stories, but it's not the causal part that some individuals would want us to believe it is. Yeah, the only thing that I would say contrary to that is some people develop expectations based on fictional accounts. Yeah, and there's a real problem like romantic movies where some people will expect behavior that exists in these romantic movies only. Right. And it's not indicative of human beings in the real world. Yeah, yeah, point well taken. I mean, I think the vital thing is that your brain has had sufficient experience that it can weight these fictional accounts in a way that can enhance your response to the world, but not set undue expectations of things that are just, you know, only going to be true in the fictional setting and not in the real world. It's just so strange to me that we desire those. I mean, hero movies, right? Yeah. Like hero movies in particular, especially superhero movies. Someone who possesses powers beyond anything known to human beings or any life form. Yeah, I get that. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure. Well, I love to just snap your fingers and fix everything. But I actually see it in in in in a slightly different way relevant to what we were talking about before, you know, I think that the whole hero worship that we have as a culture comes again from our recognition of how powerless we are against the forces of nature, against the inevitable death that is facing us all. And therefore, there's something deeply seductive about the possibility of a being that can transcend the limitations that we mere mortals are always subject to. So, I think it's built into our DNA to respond to the way that we do, and the amount of that we do when encountering a hero in the world. I mean, there's, you know, Joseph Campbell. Yeah. Yeah. You know, so, you know, the power of myth, but is more technical version to hear with a thousand faces. You know, he goes through the whole notion of what it is to have a myth and it's basking an individual. It's call to action to rise above the kinds of activities that mere mortals will be able to undertake. Resist the call at first, but then rises to the challenge, goes out into the world, conquerors comes back, a changed individual, and shakes up the reality from which that individual initially emerged on this journey. And there is ample evidence that across cultures, throughout the ages, we have constantly been telling these kinds of mythological tales because they speak to us. They speak to our urge and our desire to transcend the limitations that our physical form and the laws of physics necessarily constrained us to. Yeah. It's, it is fascinating when you think of how many different languages and how many different cultures share those same archetypal themes. Yeah. Yeah. And I do think it all comes if you look way back into the history of the ideas, it comes from this initial recognition that we are mortal. And the fact that our brains are able to not just fix on the moment, but can think about the entire timeline is the one that makes that a poignant realization. And if we couldn't think about the future, who would it matter if we knew that we were going to die? I mean, it would mean nothing. Right. But the fact that we can innovate and the fact that we have ingenuity that allows us to make the wheel, that allows us to build the pyramids that allows us to come up with quantum mechanics and Einstein's equations and Beethoven's symphony and Picasso's work. The fact that we can undertake all of these expressions of creative will and the desire to transcend the world around us has a downside. And the downside is we recognize that we are not going to be here for very long. And I think that motivates a certain kind of engagement with the world and hero worship is part of it. Because while is a fascinating care, yeah, he thinks he's going to be around forever. Yeah. I was bringing him up. Yeah. Have you discussed any of this stuff with him? You know, I don't know him personally. I have certainly gone to some of his talks. And I think he and I had one exchange at some point in the past. And I totally get where he's coming from. You know, he feels that we're perhaps the final mortal generation. And how sad it is. After, you know, a hundred thousand generations of humans if we could only stick around for one more generation, science would come to a point where we would be immortal. And that feels like a tragic state of affairs. I don't think he's right. And I think most people who think about this deeply don't think he's right either. However many vitamins you take and however much science is progressing, the notion that we are just a generation or two from immortality, I think is wishful thinking. The strange concept of immortality too because it's not necessarily you. It's a downloaded version of you that will exist in some sort of computer, which is what does that mean? That sounds like hell. Yeah. It could be. Yeah. You know, how REM sleep in that computer? Well, I allow for the possibility that maybe it would be a way of being in the world that would have upsides that are hard for us as flesh and blood individual. To appreciate this point. But it raises the deep question. Would that be a good thing? In fact, if you had that opportunity to be downloaded in some form and that would allow you to hold on to all your memories, build new memories on top of them, have experience and maybe there's an avatar that you're able to drive, but through your mental machinations, who's out there in the world, would you do it? I might have said yes before I've had some pretty profound psychedelic experiences. And then from then I said, I'm gonna hedge my bets. Let me see what's next. Right. Let me see what happens when the lights go out. Oh, really? So you think there may be something that happens when the lights go out? I don't know. Yeah. I don't know what, I mean, for sure, your body is going to decay and you are going to become a part of the earth. You're becoming part unless they cremate you or unless they embalm you with some toxic chemicals and then nothing can use your dead tissue, which is really a shame. Yeah. It's really a shame that we do that, right? Yeah. I mean, unless some of the murders you and you have to exume you in the past to solve in the future, whether or not solve a murder, but I don't know what, what do you think consciousness is? Yeah. I think consciousness is clearly just a factor of brain tissue and an energy or do you think it's possible that what our brain is is something that tunes into consciousness. Yeah. Well, I spend, I spend some time thinking about this question. I think it's perhaps the deepest question that faces signs or even humanity at some level. And my own personal perspective is that consciousness is nothing more than the choreographed motion of particles in various quantum states inside a gloppy, gray structure that sits inside this thing that we call ahead. Do I have any proof for that? No. Does anybody have any proof for what consciousness is not at all at this moment? But the history of the reductionist program where we've been able to take some of the more spectacular creations that have emerged in the world and recognize that they are nothing but the product of their ingredients and the laws of physics leads me to extrapolate that idea to the experience of consciousness. Now, having said that, there's a deep puzzle. It's called the hard problem of consciousness, which is if electrons and corks and particles and laws of physics are all that there is. And if you buy into the fact that electrons don't have an inner world that corks don't have an inner world, how can it be that by taking a collection of those particles, you can turn on the lights? How can a collection of mindless, thoughtless particles somehow yield mindful experience? And that's a deep question that science has not yet answered. My own feeling is when we understand the brain better, that question will evaporate. We'll look at the brain with our new found understanding, maybe it's 100 years in the making, maybe a thousand years in the making, and we'll say, aha, when electrons and corks and protons move in this particular configuration, one of the byproducts is an inner sensation that we call conscious experience. And that to me is the likely answer that we will find. But there are some very smart, well-respected people who go in a very different direction. There are some who say electrons and protons and corks, they do have a fundamental, proto-conscious quality. They themselves are conscious beings of a sort. Now, it's not like you're going to have electrons that are crying or are corks that are anguishing, but if you have a little proto- element of conscious experience that is imbued into a particle, and then you take a lot of the particles and put them together, the ideas, that yields the manifest conscious experience that we're familiar with. I don't buy into that, but there are people who do pick a position. Well, I take a position on this because I guess my view is you look out at the world. And what you do as a physicist is you move the smallest degree required to explain the phenomena that you are observing. And to move from our current understanding of the world, to leapfrog to a place where electrons are conscious and corks are conscious, to me is such a fantastically radical move that I don't consider it justified to make that move with our current level of understanding. There was a time back in the 1800s when life itself was so mystical that people basically said the same kind of thing. How could a collection of lifeless particles ever come together and yield a living being? They said that they can't. You have to induce a life force, you have to inject vitality, you have to inject a life force, and that's what sparks the emergence of life on lifeless particles. I don't think any serious scientists thinks that today. I think most serious scientists say yes, life is wonderful, life is in some sense miraculous, but life is nothing but the particles of nature coming together to yield the complex molecules of DNA and RNA, the complex cellular structures, the cells come together to yield the more complex multicellular organisms, and that's all that it takes to have something that's alive. No life force is necessary. That way of thinking about the world has gone away. My own feeling is that that kind of progression is going to happen for consciousness. Today it's utterly mysterious. How it is that I have this inner voice talking inside my head? How it is that I look around the world and I can see the color red and I can experience the color red. I don't just have sensors that can call that red. I mean, an iPhone can do that. I actually have an inner world where I feel that color red. Where does that come from? Hard to answer that question, but I think a hundred or a thousand years from now will look back in smile at how we in this era invested consciousness with such mystical quality, when in the end it's nothing but particles and the laws of physics and that's all there is to it. Well, what's interesting too to me is that as a human being, my thoughts on consciousness are very deep and profound and this idea like what is this thing? But if I really break it down objectively, an animals have some sort of a consciousness, including they have instincts, right? They're trying to get away from danger. They try to survive and procreate and we developed something far more complex in our ability to express ourselves in language and in doing that language, during that creation of that language, we developed all sorts of bizarre concepts and we've developed all sorts of different ways to describe feelings and emotions and contemplate the future as well. These things are continually getting more and more complex. If you go to single cell organisms, work your way up to early hominids and then get to human beings, you just see this ever increasing form of complexity in every way. Yes. And in the way that the things see the world, of course it makes sense that there would be more complexity, right? But we don't think about that when we think of a parakeet. We don't think of a parakeet as being conscious, but a parakeet relatively speaking is far more primitive than a chimpanzee, which is relatively speaking far more primitive than a human being, and it's just going to continue to evolve or if we survive, things will continue to improve due to natural selection and the end mutation and all the other factors and will be something that makes this today look like primitive. The way we look at single cell organisms or champs or whatever. Yeah, I can well imagine that. Because we see small changes in DNA, you know, a tiny fraction of a percent yields a radical change in what the being that has that DNA is able to accomplish. But at the same time, you made references to psychedelic experiences. Yeah. And I trust you agree, but tell me if you don't, that those psychedelic experiences were generated by a slight change in the chemical makeup of the particles coursing through your brain and your body. Sometimes not even a change. Sometimes a lot of them that heavier ones are actually produced by the brain. Right. So to me, that's a great piece of data that speaks to the fact that all it is is particles and chemicals coursing through a structure, because if the mind was somehow external to the physical makeup and the laws describing it, then how would the injection say of some kind of foreign substance or, as you say, the brain producing some sort of substance that it didn't ordinarily have within its makeup, why would that be able to have such a radical impact on conscious experience? The way I would look at it if I was trying to argue against that would be that your eyes and the organs of the human eye are taking in light and through that light are able to perceive physical objects in the world that they would not be able to do without light. Yes, it's something that allows you to see and allows you to take in depth perception and understand shapes that the human mind and particularly these glands that produce these psychedelic chemicals, when experiencing these chemicals, it allows the brain to experience things that might be there all the time. Yes. But that you cannot perceive with normal human neurochemistry that needs to be enhanced or the levels need to be changed and shifted and what's really perplexing about these chemicals is that these chemicals are produced by your brain and if you do take these particularly dimethyl triptomy, is the most potent of all the psychedelic chemicals, if you take that, you have these insanely profound visions which is leads to a lot of people having these religious spiritual epiphanies. Have you done anything? Have you done anything psychedelic experiences? Are you allowed to talk about? Yeah, I have. Not many and I'm a complete lightweight in this arena because I hardly drink, you know, I hardly do anything that it puts foreign substance into the body. But yeah, I was in I was in Amsterdam. I was there because I was giving a lecture to the Queen of Holland and I gave the lecture, my wife and I were both there and after that was over, we decided to do a little experimenting and for somebody like me who doesn't experiment, I made a mistake because it's a treat it. Well, the first night we went out and we went to one of these coffee bars and I guess it can be about this. You know, I am... It's legal here. Yeah, totally legal exactly. You know, we took the easy way in like the the the novice version and it did nothing to me at all that first night. So the next night when we went, I went right to the bottom of the list where they it was something that was in Dutch or something but it had like machine guns, you know, pointed at a brain kind of thing. Yeah, so so I did that version and it was the most terrifying experience of my fucking life. I was saying to say that either, but we were in a club, we were in a club and all of a sudden the world changed and what started happening is my brain started manufacturing versions of myself that would converse with me and convince me that the reality that I was experiencing was real and then that version of me would destroy that reality and the process would start over and over and over again. Is this something you smoke do a smoke? Yeah, wow. Definitely smoke. And again, I suspect that the impact was because my body has no experience. Oh for sure. You know, and so I think that just enhanced the the impact and you know, it was terrifying. It was utterly I was in the hotel room and I was clinging to the bed and and I actually said to my wife time me up not and not and any not it sounds wrong. I mean, I mean, I mean, time it because I'm like terrified of what I'm going to do right, you know, wow, you know, and and so instead, you know, she she called doctor and I was like she was like a afraid this would be like in the newspaper because I just like you've elected to the queen, you know, but you know, they're so used to Americans getting in over their head with this kind of experience. So it was something that they were completely used to. So you know, they they sent up a doctor and the doctor basically just gives you sugar and my wife knew that this was an extreme circumstance from because I don't eat any sugar, but I was like he said he does my I was like taking a milky way bars like sugar. I'm sorry, I don't know. I don't know the chemistry behind this, but but sugar is the the antidote. Caffeine is supposed to help me. Caffeine helped too. Yeah, I guess, but it lasted eight hours. Even flying home on the plane the next day. All I did is I sat on my seat and I put on the headphones and there was a Beatles channel and I just like listened to Beatles for like for like seven hours and I was just, you know, in this in this in this place that I had never experienced before. Now, now, you know, for our conversation, you know, this just made it so intuitively obvious to me that my conscious awareness is totally dependent on a few chemicals. Right. That's all the tapping inside of the head. So in a way, it was a valuable experience. It's not something that I want to ever experience again. Absolutely, but it was something that helped align my intuitive understanding of what consciousness is with the scientific recognition that it all relies upon the stuff that's circulating inside of your mind. Yeah, what's interesting about this, this, these heavy duty psychedelic experiences because what you took was, by most people's idea of very mild. Yeah, but no profound psychedelic chemicals that are also produced by your brain. If you just shift that ratio and not by too much, really, you're not talking about even, you're talking about little small doses of this stuff. Shift that ratio, it produces these profound visions. It's just like Ayahuasca type. Yeah, Ayahuasca is just an early active version of dimethylchip. Okay. Okay. They figured out how to, you know, your brain, your gut rather produces monoemine oxidase and it breaks down dimethylchip to mean. And so they figured out how to combine an MAO inhibitor with the leaves of another plant that has the dimethylchip to mean. And I say, but you could take it, there's synthetic versions of it. But the prop point is this is something that your brain produces, your liver produces. We know it's produced in the lungs. It's the body makes it. Yeah, right. But it's got, it's in there, but that can get a down. Shift the balance and also you have these incredibly profound visions. Yeah. It makes you think like what, what we have now in terms of our balance and our chemicals must be different than what this fellow must have had. Yes, chimpanzee thing. Right. And primates before that as the human, like, when you think of human evolution, do you ever stop to think, what are we going to be like a million years now if we do survive? What have you ever done this sort of thought experiment we say? Okay, if things keep going the same way, we used to be very strong and very hairy and we're getting progressively softer as we don't need to use our bodies as much. Our brains are getting larger. Our hands are getting bigger. Do you do that sort of thought experiment to see what we're going to be common? Not in a systematic scientific way because the process is so fraught with incredible detail that I think it's hard for anybody, even experts in evolution ideology to really tell us anything that will hold water. That's really predictive. But on a general level, yeah, I mean, because people often wonder, why is it that we haven't been visited by aliens, right? This is the thing that comes up whenever you're talking about other life inside the universe. Yeah, yeah, but but the answer to that could be quite straightforward. Nobody out there cares about us because we're so ill developed. We're so young on the cosmic scene that there's nothing interesting for them to find here on planet earth. So to me, there's a natural explanation for why there can be stuff out of their life out there and yet they don't hang out around planet earth. Just so we don't hang around on an handheld to try to have a conversation with, you know, what's going on inside that particular structure. I buy that argument the least. You do agree that. Okay, because we're interested in butterflies. Butterflies are so boring. We're we're interested in moles. We're interested in, you know, but interested in in the moles. We're interested in them for very specific reasons. Sure. So typically we're interested either because we want to see the evolutionary development that yields this particular life form or because there's a general curiosity about how this objects is put together. If these other beings are so far beyond us, at those kinds of tax and an taxonomy questions are no longer of any interest, then hanging around here may not hold anything for them to make the journey and stick around long enough for us to notice. I don't buy that again for two reasons. Okay. Because why would we assume that they're so far beyond us that they wouldn't be interested in these talking monkeys with thermonuclear weapons who dominate an entire planet. Yeah. That would be fascinating right now. Some planet somewhere where people or the politicians all lie to themselves. Everyone gets video through the sky. They fly in metal tubes that hurl over the, over the oceans. Right. They pollute the oceans and eat all the fish like these people are fucking crazy. Yeah. We've got to go there and check this out. But but imagine that this civilization, the notion of lording over a planet is like us talking about, you know, the ant lording over a grain of sand. So they may be galactic as opposed to planetary in their hegemony. And the notion of some little tiny rock orbiting some nondescript star in the suburbs of this completely ordinary galaxy off there on the side may not have the kind of poll that you imagine that disagree. We think it's interesting when we see a champions erocto open up a nut. You know, we think it's interesting that, you know, there's an amazing photograph of an orangutan that's spearfishing of your scene at. I have seen that actually. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get right notice. He learned it from people apparently, but still interesting nonetheless. Right. But I don't think a hundred years from now we're going to be as interested in these kind of qualities or a thousand years for now or ten thousand years from now. Well, why we assume that these things that come here from another planet are more than ten thousand years. Well, that's a good, that's a very good question. And I think the the answer to that is we look at the history of the cosmos until today and it's say let's just call it our universe to be concrete. 13.8 billion years. And we look at life on planet earth and it's, you know, a handful of billions of years old. So in a handful of billions of years, you can go from some complex molecules to human beings. I'll tell you say it like it's not that long. It's not that long because, you know, imagine that life began a few billion years earlier in some other system, you know, stars and galaxies. They were starting up, you know, a billion years after the big bank. So it could be that life in other worlds has a head start on us by a few billion years. And we know what can happen in a few billion years. It can take us from single cell to us. Sure. And you can imagine from a few billion years from now into the future, it could be radically different. So to say it's 10,000 years ahead of us, that to me would be the unexplained coincidence. How unlikely that they started and we started with them 10,000 years in the span of billions of years. That seems unlikely, isn't it? Does it seem unlikely when you're talking about the infinite size of the universe and this perhaps an infinite number of Brian Greenschild that they're talking to an infinite numbers of me? Good point. Good point. So you're absolutely right. We're almost guaranteed if the spatial expansion of the universe is infinitely long. Yeah. There are going to be places where it's within 10,000 years. Sure. But those are going to be a very small number compared to the places where it's not 10,000 years. Is that true or would it be an infinite number of them? Well, it's the infinite number at all. But they're different kinds of infinity. So you mean in the space of the exact scope of the universe itself, a small number relatively speaking to where we are. Yes. Well, I would say it's like different. I'd say look at a finite size ball in this large spatial expansion. So everything's finite. Let's get a 5 billion light year ball. Right. And within that ball, the number that are differing from us by 10,000 years would be very, very small compared to the number differing from us by, say, a billion years or a couple of billion years. So then simply by the law of numbers. If we imagine that the random processes that are now there could be some physical principle that prevents life from emerging before, say, four billion years ago. And if that's the case and we're not aware of that principle, then you'd be absolutely right that we'd all be roughly at the same starting point. And there's no reasons to respect that they would be so far ahead of us. But I don't know of any such principle. But yeah, you almost have a reductionist view of this, right? Like you do. So if you had a guess, if you had a hundred dollars to bet, has alien life ever observed us, you would say no. Well, by observed, you mean could it just turn a big telescope in our direction and gather some radio waves? You know, but yes, I would take that bet. Because frankly, we've only been generating radio wave for the last, you know, 70 years. So it's only a 70 light year ball around us. And within that small radius, very unlikely that there's been some alien world that's examining us. So it have to be something that would be able to recognize our signal and visit us. But don't we look at observable planets and solar systems and discover Goldilocks planets? We didn't. We examined those planets from vast distances away. Yes. And wouldn't you assume that a life form that is perhaps thousands of years more advanced than us with the exponential increase in technology? I mean, if they ever got to the point where we are, that they would see these Goldilocks planets as well. And recognize that Earth is one of them. Yes. However, if they are so far away, they're going to be examining Earth as it was hundreds of thousands or millions of billions of years ago. So if you truly want them to be examining us in the sense of human presence on planet Earth, then it's a much more difficult proposition to imagine that they've actually been doing this. Is it possible there's another way to examine things where you're not hampered by the speed of not that I know of? I mean, any signal in the world that we're aware of is restricted by a special theory by the speed of travel, which is now look there's quantum entanglement, which is a strange property of the quantum world. And which disan objects can behave as if they are one. Yes. And in some sense, respond instantaneously to an influence in one location at a distant location no matter how far apart they are. But that isn't really observing. That more, that's more realizing correlations between physical properties at why these separated locations. But I'm not aware of a means of leveraging that to actually observe what's happening in some distant location, even if you do have quantum entanglement particles. For a long time, my operating theory on aliens was when I see something that's interesting, then I'm going to pay attention to it. Right. Because it's too attractive. And it's a part of the thing of whether it's ramp-tha or any of these wonky things. There's something about woo, woo stuff, whether it's psychics or channels that's really attractive to people. Yeah. Some sort of a weird way. And so is so our aliens. The idea that if we were visited by something from another world, some far advanced space daddy or whatever it is that comes down here and is going to show us the way. That's so attractive that it, I think it messes with your ordinary ability to observe and to objectively analyze what's real and what's not. Yeah. I totally agree with that. And I think it's an unfortunate feature of the human mind that we tend to look outward for weirdness that will inject into the world more than the every day that we experience through common everyday encounters. We want there to be more. We don't want it to be. Right. That we're just on this rock around this planet and we live for a while and then we're gone. We want it to be more than that. And so we imagine that there's some answer floating out there in the cosmos. Maybe that will be brought down to Earth through our space daddy as you refer to it. And my view of that is it's much more noble to recognize that there is no answer floating out there in space. There's no space daddy that's going to come here and say this is what it's all about. The answer is you and I and everybody else, we manufacture our own meaning, we manufacture our own purpose and how much better is it that we come up with the our own meaning than having a bestowed or forced upon us by some external entity. I don't think that diminishes things. I think it aggrandizes them because it's coming ultimately from ourselves. That makes a lot of sense. I think the hope is that space daddy's going to prevent nuclear war and figure out how to fix the ocean. Yeah sure. No. I mean, and that I could that I could certainly imagine happen. So there's knowledge out there in the world that you could imagine that that we have in yet encountered that we could make use of. So fantastic. But the other thing that's worth keeping in mind and this I think is surprising to some people, you can do a calculation as to whether consciousness can itself persist indefinitely in the universe. You can ask yourself, sure, Earth, Mego, way, you and I were going to go away. We recognize all this. But is it possible that some kind of conscious being can continue to cojitate indefinitely far into the future? Or it's progeny, continue to cojitate. And you can pretty much establish that thought itself will come to an end in this universe. Thought itself is a limited lifetime phenomenon in the cosmos. So when at least our universe, right? Yes. So I'm going to focus just on our relationship. So if we're going to break down a protons when we get to that point, there's no room for thought. No, that's part of it. But I'm willing to go for the I'm willing to imagine that even with the breakdown of protons that there's some way that the particles that it spawns, electrons, neutrinos, photons, whatever, somehow through some configuration of why the separated particles is able to have signals going back and forth that allows this group of particles to think. I'm willing to posit that in order to be as general as possible. And with that assumption, you can still prove that there relentless rise and entropy that we were talking about before ensures that any cogitating being that happens to still be able to persist in this unusual realm of particles will ultimately burn up in the entropic waste generated by its own process of thinking. So the process of thought itself in the far future will generate too much heat for that being to be able to release that heat to the environment and to avoid burning up in its own waste. When you think you will fry, dude. It's always been interesting to me when I've really stepped back and looked at it that our ideas of the importance of thought are so egocentric when we take into consideration the vast scope of the universe and how majestic so much we see in the cosmos that there's no thought, at least as far as we know, whatsoever, like hypernovas, like like you, star nurseries. All these different things that we see in the cosmos that are infinitely larger than us and responsible for life itself that these processes create the very elements that are needed to create life but we're so concerned with this one animal's ability to think and ponder, create and emotions and write stories and to us. It's so egocentric. How is everything? It's a really self-centered, when you think of the infinite universe. We are to finite beings sitting in the valley, you know, in front of a wooden desk. It's really weird that we think about it's so important that everything does. It is, it is and it's hard to not think in those terms, but I encourage people, in the part of the point of this book is to encourage people to think in a cosmic way and recognize the point that you're making, which are with these little tiny, finite beings crawl around on this planet. We're here for a brief moment of cosmic time and that's all there is to it. And some will feel like, oh my God, that's disturbing, that's distressing. My point is, hey, extol, celebrate the fact that you are here for this brief. I mean, think about the collection of quantum events, stretching back from the big bang until today, that had to turn out exactly as they did for you and for me to actually exist. Each one of these quantum events and there are nearly infinitely many of them could have turned out that way instead of this yielding a universe, which neither you nor I nor anybody else would be here and yet against those astounding odds. Astounding odds were here. That is cause for celebration and you can go further, not only over here, we can figure out how we got here. We can create art. We can write the stories that you are referring to. We can create comedy. We can build monuments. We can create films. We can do things that inanimate objects can't. So this to me is where the value and purpose and meaning comes from as opposed to trying to look out and hope space daddy comes with the answer of flashing in neon signs saying, ah, ha, that's what it's all about. That's never going to happen. It is what it might. It might have to be yours. I admit that it's possible. So every time I say it's not going to happen, I mean, and likely that it's going to vary unlike, yeah, I agree with that. But it's interesting to me that that's the thing that we look forward to the most, to the average person if they think about space. They think about intelligent life. That is far more interesting to them than the fact that there's black holes out there that are devouring planets. There's sucking stars into its event horizon. This infinite point of density that we can't even really begin to imagine with our own little brains. Yeah. And the fact that all this arose without a guiding intelligence, you know, that there are black holes and there are active galactic nuclei. And there are black holes slamming into each other, creating gravitational waves that we can actually detect. I mean, it is a wonderfully rich reality that we are fortunate to be part of. Do you experience much pushback or much conflict from religious people who don't like the fact that you described things in that way that didn't need an intelligent force or intelligent creator to tell you. Well, it's an interesting question because the biological community, people like Richard Dawkins and the like, I think have really born the brunt of the religious pushback because they're dealing directly with the phenomena of life. And that's the precious commodity that somehow we want to be sacred. And therefore our religious sensibility will push back on it just being the minus laws of physics and evolution yielding life on planet Earth. They haven't pushed as hard on the quantum physicists and the cosmologists as they have on the biologists. But I have that conversations. Many of them are respectful as opposed to antagonistic where the view is that I am wrongheaded that I am missing the point. And some of these religious folks are fantastically accomplice scientists. That's weird. Yeah. I mean, I went to a gathering. I think I can talk about that and I was closed or gathering. We weren't meant to describe it. I was really open to myself. And I thought it was science and spiritual quest. And it was a bunch of scientists that were being brought together. And I thought it was going to be an interesting but ultimately one note meeting. I thought everybody's going to basically say the same thing. There could be a god. There's no evidence for a god. We've got the laws of physics and we're going to just press forward under the assumption that physics is all there is until the clouds part and god reveals him herself or itself to us. And at that point we may change our tune. It was not one note. I was the only person who had that perspective in the room. Everybody else was coming out religion from a very different way of thinking about the world. In fact, there's one noble laureate in the room who got up and sang songs as part of his presentation. And I was sitting there and I was like, what is happening here? This is so unexpected to me. And what it really meant was I was so close mind it into the varieties of religious engagement that happened in the world. And it opened my eyes. And there's one noble laureate in particular. I did say to him at the end. I said, when you look at me and you hear my view, what do you think? And he kind of put his arm around me in a funcular way and said, you know, your real smart guy and you don't understand the true reality. And I think ultimately you will because you're open minded. And you're on a journey and I hope that your journey will finally take it to the place where I have been for for many years. That was so unexpected. That there's no bell-loorate who I respected for his concrete mathematical and experimental work saw the world completely differently. No, it was the spectrum of belief. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. But I was the one who was far out. I was the one who was untethered. Yeah, I mean, I came in there and I was like, whoa, you know, and and and and and and clearly they arranged the meeting to have a spectrum of perspectives. I mean, this is not something that was randomly designed and it just so happened. But it was an eye opener. And from that, I went to read, you know, William James's book of varieties of religious experience. No, so it's a book that William James, great so called just wrote in 1902. And it was based on a series of lectures. I think he gave in Scotland. And it is the most heartfelt and rational approach to religion and science that I think has ever been written. And yet most people don't know much about it. Because what he does is he goes through and he documents through his own research and through reading, biographies and interviewing individuals, the vastly different ways that people think about religion and why they think about religion and the value that religion has in their lives. And and and when you read that book, it doesn't convert me. I haven't changed my views on whether or not there is a God. But it has changed my views on the value of a religious sensibility. The role that a place in people's lives now look, it can be, you know, talk to people like Sam Harris and and you know, it's a destructive force in the world. And it has been a destructive force in some ways. But that's not the full story. A full story is that for some individuals, it gives a connection to a historical lineage that's deeply valued. For some individuals, it puts their life in a larger setting that allows them to be in the world in a more productive way. So there are a whole range of roles that religious engagement can play. The problem is when you start to put it against scientific insight, then you run into trouble. But religion was never developed to give us factual information about the world. Religion will never give us the electronic magnetic moment to nine decimal places. That's the purview of scientific investigation. If you can keep these straight in your mind, there's a definite and powerful role for a religious sensibility in the world. Yeah, I feel like it gives people in a lot of ways of scaffolding for ethics and morality and allows them some alleviation of anxiety. Yeah, exactly. A feeling of purpose is, but like you said, as long as it's not conflicting with the rigid scientific reality, it's like scientific provable scientific reality. Yeah, and I gotta tell you there's a funny thing. Richard Dawkins, I don't know. Yeah, I had him on the program. So you know that his M.O. in the world is very anti-religious. I think he would agree with me on that. I don't want to put words into his mouth. But I did a event with him in New York. The beacon theater. I don't know, it was maybe a year ago or something like that. And it was very interesting because in a one-on-one conversation, his views were very similar to mine. I felt, look, we don't agree in totality. But I was saying to him, there are times I go around the world and I will do things that are utterly irrational on knock-on wood for good luck. I'll speak to my dead father. I know that he's not really there. I'll pray to God on occasion if I think that I could use that backup. Not because I think there's some bearded individual in the sky, it's just a behavioral tendency that I find to be comforting and useful. And I said this to Richard. And he said, I totally get it. I was like, what? He was like, I totally get it. He said, he said, in fact, he said, I don't like to sleep in a house that has a reputation. It's being haunted. You know, you know? And for me, it was such a beautiful human moment. It was such a beautiful human moment where we were just like being human beings. And he said, and then they said, we're both sinners. And I agree, we are both sinners in that sense. Because we know how the world works. We know this doesn't make any sense. And yes, it's still part of somehow how we behave in the world. And I think there's a value to recognizing that that is what it means to be human. You will engage in the world in ways that are not necessarily strictly adhering to some rational perspective of how the scientific world operates. I would love to see Richard Dawkins outside of a haunted house saying we're not going into it. Exactly. Exactly. You know. Oh. Yeah. So, you know, it's all just to say, that I kind of feel like there are many pathways toward insight in the world. There are many ways to come to terms with our own impermanence. And it's not as though something is right or something is wrong. It's a question of, isn't it useful to you? And I think that we have to be very open-minded in the kinds of behaviors that we allow to happen in the world. You know? You know, even romped it's not a stuff. Yeah. But if some of those individuals who go there find that it allows them to live in the world in a more productive way, alleviating anxiety, feeling like they're on a spiritual quest. Mm-hmm. So be it. Yeah. That's the thing that's something. I mean, it's hard for people to understand if you're not in that space, that head space that they are. You don't need this structure. But for some people, even Scientology or something along those lines, it seems loopy on paper can provide them with legitimate structure and benefit their lives. Yeah. And a tangible way they can describe to you. Yeah. Exactly. And my feeling is that if there was, I don't know this to the case, and maybe some biologists will push back on this. But if there was a race of, for want of the better word, you know, Vulkan-like individuals who approach the world in a completely rational manner, evaluating the data, figuring out the most sensible course of action, competing against a crazy group of individuals like us who will come up with wild fictional ideas, gods in the heavens, you know, demons haunting the world. I think it's the latter group that ultimately would triumph because with that kind of freedom of thought, you get novelty, you get ingenuity, you get creativity. And so I feel as though this is part and parcel of who we are and why we have survived. And to sort of come at the world with a scientific club that's meant to smash away anything that disagrees with the scientific world view is an unfortunate way of looking at the world. Yeah. There's something about creativity that it doesn't necessarily have to abide by any laws of logic and it can still be beneficial. Yeah. And that's why it's so stunning when somebody comes up with something that's like, where did that come from? It didn't come from a rational approach to working out, you know, Brahms-Third Symphony. It emerged from the churning emotions of an individual who happens to be made up of trillions of particles guided by physical law responding to the environment which is impinging his senses with an incredible array of influences and through that world emerges the spectacular piece of music. That's breathtaking. Utdally breathtaking. Yeah. And it's amazing what that music can inspire. Yeah. As it reaches out to you know, X amount of people and then causes different thoughts in their mind. Yeah. And then that causes in turn another branch of creativity, another new line of thinking that they might have ever never pursued before. Yeah. And that's to me establishes that the notion, that language, is the only way that we can know about the world. Vic and Stein had this perspective, not the limits of my language, limits of my world. That seems to me utterly wrong. I mean, the experience of music or the experience of cogitating about the world, but not trying to overlay a narrative upon it, just feeling your way into reality reveals things about the world that I think are beyond linguistic. Do you ever listen to music when you're pondering an equation or whether you're going over a problem? It's an interesting question. When I was in college, I couldn't have any sound on when I was trying to say learn quantum mechanics or relativity. But I would find that it would capture my brain too fully and I couldn't focus on the equations that I was trying to understand. But the funny thing is in writing this book for the very first time, I found that there were passages that I couldn't write if it was quiet. I needed to have music playing because in some sense, by focusing too directly on what I was trying to say, I couldn't say it. I only found that I could make progress in certain kinds of descriptions by allowing my brain to fly off through whatever musical experience I was playing and allowing the freedom of thought to then emerge within that unusual for me environment. What kind of music it varied incredibly a lot of slayer? No, so some of it was classical. I remember there's one vital passage when I was writing words. Do you know pentatonic? They are a spectacular occapella group who are able to take songs that you have heard and transform them into sort of transcendent performances. So you should check these guys out. But other times, it would just be loud, rock, loud beetles, loud rolling stones. The soundtrack from the greatest showmen, you know, just blaring that thing and somehow it just allowed me a certain kind of linguistic freedom that I could not acquire in my normal way of being in the world, which is everyone's quiet. Let me just work out my equations and I need total focus and no distraction. So is this something that you sort of evolved of the course of your career? Absolutely. Absolutely. It was not there early on. And there's this phenomenon. I don't know if this is anything more than a metaphor or an analogy, but whatever. You know, there are certain things in the night sky that you can't see if you look at them directly. But by looking off access, you're able to invoke other qualities of the eye that are able to sense those features of the night sky. And I kind of feel like it's the same thing. Sometimes by focusing directly on what you want to do, you can't do it. And you've got to look obliquely. You've got to look off access metaphorically. And that's the only way that you can accomplish what you set out to do. And certainly music is one of the ways to take one's attention and shift it in a different direction to get that oblique view of what it is that you're trying to do. And I have found that it allows for progress that otherwise is unattainable. And is that the case also when you were writing this book? It was absolutely was a case writing this book. You know, there, you know, I have a very wife is very understanding. So we have a house up, we live in Manhattan, you know, in in Mac Columbia. But she would let me go up to our house upstate with the dogs and by myself. And I would disappear for weeks on end. And I'd hold myself up in this cabin in the woods. And I would sometimes write deep into the night. And there were no neighbors around. So I could turn on the music. I would ever volume my found useful. And I would do it. And I would find, you know, that it freed up a certain kind of creative thought process that to me was striking because I had never approached work in that way before. And it was really deeply interesting. So how did you come to this idea of doing it that way of? I was struggling on certain things. And I felt as though I am approaching this in a very flat-footed way. I want to write about this. You know, say, I want about write about human creativity. I want to write about religious engagement. And I am just doing what I've always done, which is I have this equation. And I want to solve it. So I'm going to bring the tools of mathematics to bear to solve it. And I was approaching this writing project and exactly the same mind frame. And as it wasn't working, I said, let me smack my brain around a little bit. And so one way of, you know, it could be psychedelics. I didn't go that direction. But I smacked it around by forcing myself to be subject to a great deal of distraction in the environment around me. And it really made a difference. It's interesting that you did it in a calculated manner. Yeah, so I can't break free fully from my my physicist training, you know. But it's wise. I mean, that that way of doing it is, and it's also a time tested, you know, from right, from the road to, you know, beginning of the game. And the fun of it is you never worked for me in the past because the focus, I think when I'm doing mathematics, it does need at least for me personally to be that kind of non-distracted total focus on what's going on. As a writer, it's a very romantic notion too. Yeah. To go to the woods and a cabin, that's what's up. Right. That's what everybody wants to do. Yeah, right. Right. Exactly. You know, when it's missing his whiskey, I supposed to get drunk out there. Yeah, that I didn't. I had the dogs and it's just like I said, I hardly ever drink, you know. But it was an unusual creative experience, which to me opened up a different way of going about trying to create things in the world. As you write more and more books, you find it to be more and more difficult or defunded to be easier. Well, my early books were all focused on trying to bring scientific ideas out to the general public. And the elk in universe was about strength theory, fabric, the cosmos, space, and time. Hidden reality is about multiple universes. And so in that role, I'm basically trying to translate from the cutting edge research into ordinary human language, so that people who don't want to go to graduate school can get the basic idea of what's going on. In this book, it was a very different proposition. I feel like I've moved in a, in a, in a significantly different direction through this book because, yes, there's science, you know, entropy evolution, the history of the universe in the beginning to the end. But the focus why we humans do what we do, why we tell stories, the emergence of language, why we tell myths, why we engage in religious experience, why creative expression is so important to us. This felt like it was drawing upon things I've been thinking about for decades, but never put into writing. So it was a harder exercise than anything that I did before because it was a different exercise. But in the end, one that I felt was even more gratifying because it was making clear why these ideas matter. As opposed to just trying to tickle the brain of the reader, I'm trying to actually, if you will, touch the heart and soul of the reader. And that's something which, if it's successful, feels very gratifying. I want to imagine that would be very hard to end to feel how, like, to put the cover on it and to go, that's it. Yeah, right, it is. And I thought that's your almost with, with all books, you know, the, the famous adage is that you never finish a book, you abandoned them. I know that's all that ever happens. And that was true in spades in this particular case because the subject was so big. Yeah. And you can always imagine going further in this direction or enhancing that description. But at some point you recognize that, you know, life is an ongoing process. And a book is ultimately a snapshot of where the author was at the moment that the book was written. And that to me is really what happens here. This is a snapshot of my view of the human conditions set against the cosmological unfolding. And how much of your perceptions of these things has evolved, you know, as an educator, and as a scientist, and as a person who's in the public eye, how much of your perceptions on these ideas have changed over the course of your career? Huge, huge. I think I was a very hard nose science thinker when I started at, I think part of this may have been I became a professor at relatively young age. I think it was 27 when I got my first faculty job. So many of the grabbed students were the same age as me. So I think I felt the need to have a very rigid, scientific outlook on the world because of that. And you know, as I've gotten older, that has changed. And my willingness to entertain a broader range of thought and experience in ways of being has as absolutely grown. The other thing that's had a vast and vital impact on mere students. You know, for 30 years, the only thing I really taught was technical physics courses, quantum mechanics or relativity, you know, thermodynamics, and what do you do there? You're at the blackboard, you're putting equations up there, you're trying to get the kids to be able to solve problems and understand what the mathematics is all about. So the only thing that really everyone is touching the cognitive part of their brain. For the last few years, I've been teaching of course the students didn't know it. That's actually based on this book. So I wanted to try out the ideas with young minds. So I taught of course a clinical origins in meaning. And in that course, I had students from across the campus, not just the physics students, the neuro students, the anthropology students, the linguistic students, the theological or, you know, so it was a whole range of students. And to see how their understanding of how their major or subject fits in to the cosmological unfolding changed many of their perspectives on what it is that they're studying and what they're doing. And to have students come to my office and to feel shook and up, shaken up, whatever the right form of that verb is, where they're saying, you know, I've lived my life in such a way. But now when I think about religion as perhaps an evolutionarily interesting and useful development as opposed to something from on high or when I think about creative expression as something that might seed ingenuity and innovation as opposed to something that is just pure inspiration coming from the outer world, I'm thinking about my life differently. And some of them, frankly, would be upset at head students come in tears. And I'd never had them when I teach quantum mechanics, you know, more than one, more than one, because they'd say this course is kind of shaking my sense of who I am and what I am in the world. What was the key aspect of it that was shaking them? Well, for some students it was the, was the notion of religion because many of them, or the sum of them, had a traditional religious upbringing and their academic life and their religious life for completely separate. And now when you have a chorus in which you're focusing upon how it would be that this institution of religion might naturally evolve on planet earth based upon what we know about humans and human brains and the evolutionary pressures that we've been under, some of them began to think about religion as a very different proposition than them one that they had when they were growing up. And I was in a position that I'd never been before of basically counseling a student and saying, hey, it's okay to have your world shake a little bit. It's okay to think about things that you may come back to exactly where you were before this course. But if a collection of ideas can make you rethink your life, at least it'll cast it in a different light. It'll illuminate it differently. Go with it, see what happens. And I never had a conversation like that when teaching Schroedon Gris equation, you know, and for me it's the most gratifying pedagogical experience that I've ever had because you're reaching the whole person as opposed to just reaching this cognitive technique of solving equations. If you can talk religion with a really intelligent person who's objective, who has a belief, it's such an interesting subject because it requires suspension of disbelief in order to absorb some of the stories. But there's clearly a history behind this of thousands of years of translations and you're trying to get to the what did they mean when they wrote this down? Yeah, how much did they know? And what were they trying to do? Were they just trying to get everybody to calm down and stay in line? Right? Or were they trying to find some means of gluing the group together by a shared piece? Or, you know, they're folks who basically say that there are qualities of the human brain that naturally leave it open to a religious sensibility. I mean, for instance, we have agency detection systems in our brain where we look around the world and we tend to assign agency to things that happen. That's useful, right? Because, you know, if you mistake a windblown branch for a Jaguar, yeah, it's fine. You thought it was Jaguar, but it was just a branch. But if the reverse happens, you think it was a Jaguar and you think it's a windblown branch. You're going to get eaten. So we tend to overend out agency into the world. There is evolutionary value to that. So when the wind blows, we tend to think there's a mind up there. When the river gurgles, we tend to think that there's a mind in there. And this is sort of the seed for the kinds of perspectives that you find in many of the world's religions. So there's natural course of events that can lead to a rising of the institution or at least the idea is behind the institution of religion. And for a students that have never encountered that idea before, it can really shake things up and I think in a very valuable way. So I think, you're absolutely right, having a conversation with somebody who has a religious perspective is deeply interesting to understand where that mind came to the place that it got to. And from a personal sensibility, I just give you one little anecdote. My dad died. I was 23 years old. And unexpectedly, I'd been visiting home. I was at Harvard at the time. I was visiting from Cambridge and we had a nice weekend. And by the time I got back to Cambridge on the bus, my mom called me said, Dad's dead. It was so shocking. It was so sudden. It was so and I remember I went back home. And my dad was not a religious man, but we knew that he would want to have a religious ceremony. And we did it. And we had a million of Jews coming to the house to recite the Cottage Prayer. Because we weren't religious. We didn't know what we were doing. And I had no idea what these men were saying. But it was deeply comforting. In fact, I didn't want to know what they were saying. To me, it was just a collection of ancient sounds. But the sounds connected me across the generations to a culture that had been extended back 5,000 years. And in a moment of crisis, that was a very comforting and useful connection to have. Yeah, that is where I find people get the most out of religion. And in the fact that it brings communities together in this sort of cohesive ritual. Everybody acts together and everybody. You feel like there's completion to it. You're putting someone in the perspective and you're doing so with this religious ceremony. And when large groups of people get together and engage in a ritual behavior, something magical happens. You know, I've spoken to evolutionary psychologists like Steve Pinker, who is a wonderful thinker. Yeah, okay. And Steve is skeptical that this kind of ritual behavior can yield the kind of cohesive bonding that some people suggest that it does. But you know, you probably have, I have the on occasion engaged in these ritual behaviors. You know, mass drumming and movement. Yeah. And I got to tell you, you are quickly, I find transported to a place where you are now part of a collective and you feel yourself melting into the group. And you are one. And if you've never had that experience, I think it's something that you should have because I think it's a vital part of our heritage. It is part of how we got to be who we are. Yeah, there's something about group acceptance and a group of people acting and doing something together that does create this very strange bond. Yeah, it doesn't necessarily exist amongst individuals. It's a weird bond. It's a very weird bond because it has nothing to do with the individuals. Nothing to do with the personality of Jim or Mary. It's irrelevant at that point. It's somehow joining you together into this massive humanity that's all engaged in the same practice and somehow you feel as though you're identity melts into the larger hole. I don't know why it happens. There's negative aspects to that sort of course. Of course. For that, yeah, mob mentality. Of course. I give you ever been in a situation where things got chaotic and you really had this feeling like anything can happen in the moment. I've seen it happen. I've never been part of it. But I have a feeling in the air. Yeah, I haven't been an algas one, which is, you know, my brother is a Harry Christna. You know, and so, you know, he is 13 years old in the May and left college in the 60s, which was a tumultuous time and went to Europe and ultimately joined into what many people think of as some kind of cultish activity. Yeah. And so, but he's not a cult thinker. He's an original thinker. He's a brilliant thinker. And yet within this group mentality, you can imagine a certain kind of group think can take over at least people imagine that this happens. So, yes, it has positive aspects. And it can have negative aspects. But in the end, I think there is a long lineage in which those of our forebears who survived were the ones who could join together into these more potent, these more powerful groups. And that way, we're able to triumph over other groups, you know, in the ancestral environment. You know, there's different readings of the archeological record. Whether it was a dangerous place in the hunter gatherer past or sort of a plastic place. But one reading says it was a very dangerous place. And therefore, those groups that survived were the ones who were able to establish this kind of allegiance to the whole. Yes. And certainly, I think this kind of ritual behavior may have been part of that. Bond together through shared experience. Yes. Yeah. And belief. And if you're all believing in the same supernatural entity, that's a powerful, imprensible, powerful glue. Do you find that there's, I mean, I don't want to say an arrogance in some academics, maybe it's on the right word. But this being too quick to dismiss any positive benefit at all about religion. Yes. It's the knee jerk reaction among a certain group of academics. And it feels deeply unfortunate to me. It almost feels like a religion of its own sort when it's just the response as opposed to a careful, thoughtful, heartfelt analysis of the situation. I frankly wish that more people would read William James' book. Because I do think that it's the kind of, because here's a scientist, right? A deeply thoughtful scientist who knows how to analyze data, knows how to rationally engage with the world, who was plumbing the depths of religion in a very, very meaningful and sensitive way. You know, by the end of these lectures, though, I think it's lecture number 20 or something, he describes religion as this, as something that helps the journey toward the, the terror and the beauty of phenomena. He describes it as the, the voice of the thunder, the gentleness of the summer rain. He described it in terms of the subliminative of the stars. And this kind of transcendent approach to the religious experience. I think brings it out of the academic guys that has often thrown upon it, which is something that is contravening everything we know about the world. It's causing people to think in ways that are irrational. I mean, this whole trope that you hear, it's not that there isn't some truth to that, but it's an incomplete truth. And if you're willing to approach religion in a way where you discard the pieces that offend you, throw away the parts that you think are utter nonsense, only keep those aspects that are useful to you in your life, then there is a place for it. I think they're in lies of problem with a lot of people. They're not willing to do that. Right. This need for suspension of disbelief, troubles them so much that they feel like fools if they buy into something. Right. And we're also dealing with all religions except the ones that are super questionable, like Scientology or Mormonism, that are very old. And the idea of maybe it would be better if we came up with something that we could all agree on in 2020. Right. Maybe it would be wonderful if we have something that maybe has science in it, maybe something that has a genuine understanding of how human beings react and what the benefits of community. And having these environments were loving, conscious people, communicate with each other in a very positive way that this could be a new form of this thing that we seem to desire so greatly. Yeah. And I agree. And I have to say I make this point in the book. Because the point that I make there is that to truly engage with the world, you have to use a variety of stories. We're fundamentally storytellers. That's what human beings are. Now there's the reduction of story that physicists are well equipped to talk about with particles and laws of physics. On top of that, you've got the chemist's story, the complex molecules. You've got the biology story that begins to talk about cells in life. You've got the psychological story, the neurophysical logical story that brings a mind in consciousness. And within that, you then have all of the activities that conscious beings undertake, which includes religion and includes telling other kinds of stories. And includes creative expression. You need them all. And to sort of say that the scientific account is the only account by which you're ever going to gain true qualities of the world as a very in my view, limited description of what truth is. There is objective truth in the world that we can measure that we can describe with equations of self-worth. But there's also internal truth, spiritual truth, that you get to by self-examination. It's real in the sense that you're understanding how you respond to the world. And that is something which is deeply personal, but utterly real. And whether it's through psychedelics, whether Siwaiwasko, whether through a spiritual journey, whether it's through religion, regardless all of this adds color to the story of what it means to be a human being. Do you spend any time meditating? I do. I'm not particularly effective at it. And so most people are that way. Yeah, you know. But years ago, effective once? Well, years ago, a friend of mine bought me one of these transcendental meditation courses. And I was like, okay, I'll just try it. He spent the money. I'm going to actually go and do it. And it was kind of eye-opening. There was a lot of what you might call Wu Wu stuff that was happening in the lectures. And in fact, the funnest thing is the guy given the lecture, he did recognize me. And you could tell how uncomfortable he was giving his normal description because he kept looking at me sheepously as he invoked quantum physics and things of that sort. You know. But I was like, I told him, I've do whatever this, I'm not here to judge you. I'm just here to sort of if he was going on. But the idea of allowing the mind to be in a different mode of operation, which is sort of how I summarized the experience. You know, if you're, if you're reciting the mantra in your mind and allowing that to be a sort of pedal point, a driver of how your mind is behaving at that moment, that's a very different way of being in the world from thinking about grocery shopping or solving Einstein's equations. And I think that to me is the devaluer of it. It's a systematic way to put your mind in a different mode of operation. And at times, I find it very useful to move into that place. When you started doing transatlamentation, what about it was weird? Well, what was weird? Number one was doing this in this, in this group setting, which is how you start on this course. And moreover, it being framed in a manner that I had trouble aligning with my understanding of how the world works by virtue of the lectures that were given to us for what it is what we're doing. But through the practice, I sort of found, I'm sure I'm just translating from what they were saying in the lecture into a language that I'm more comfortable with. And that made it less weird for me. Because of what you're talking about religion, just kind of cutting out the thing that didn't make any sense to me and saying, hey, what is this really about? What this really is about is breaking the usual chain of thought that is 99.9% of the time of how I live in the world and allowing my brain to have a chain of thought that is artificial. Because I'm sitting here forcing myself to recite this mantra inside my mind. But that's a very useful way of being because it's unfamiliar and it's novel and allows my brain to operate in a different way. So when I translated into that language, it all of a sudden made a lot more sense to me and became not weird at all. It became an interesting practice. And do you still do it? I do it when I feel I need it. So either friends of mine who say, I cannot live in the world if I don't do my 20 minutes in the morning. Simply, that's part of my routine. I don't feel that way. But there are moments when I say, whoa, I need to do it. And based on circumstance, based on what's happening to given moment, it allows a kind of mental reset if that's a language that makes sense. And that reset, I consider to be a valuable thing to do. Now, do you do? Do you do this? I do. I don't do TM, but I do meditate and regular basis. Yeah, regular basis. And I also have a float tank here. Okay, do you do? Really? Like a deprivation? Yeah. In this building? Yeah, that's right over there. I'll show it to you after we're done. Wow. Yeah. What can I do it? Sure. You could have you like it. Have you done it before? I've never done it before. I find it a little bit terrifying. Do you have my same? I do. Yeah, there's plenty of them. There's a bunch of different float places. It's not terrifying at all. Really? Yeah, you just float relax. But it's complete darkness. Oh, yeah, yeah. Because I have some claustrophobia. Yeah. And that's like, for instance, I can't go into an MRI machine. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah. Totally. And that's what you want to try. Why do you get that out of your head? I tried. I got to tell you I trained. So I have a desk in my office where it's only about like one foot high. And I'd slide my body underneath the desk, close lock the door because I'm too weird. And I'd stay under there as long as I possibly could just to train myself. Like 15, 20, but I get into the real machine and really. Yeah. My wife's mom was like that. Yeah. Like she didn't MRI and she's like, it was the worst experience of my life. I did two of them last week. I totally totally. I totally understand her. I totally. Yeah. I don't understand why someone as smart as you would not recognize. Well, there's just, let's take around me and I do. I do. But it's like the irrational part of the thing. I get in there. My heart starts to pound. When I think that comes from, I don't know because it wasn't always there. And it has gotten worse in certains. There was a time, again, it's going to come across like a nut case. Maybe it was that trip to Amsterdam. Yeah, I missed her. It was a way to bring her out. There was actually times when I couldn't even go in a tunnel in a car. The cluster phobia was that bad. Really? Yeah. It was in a taxi cab. I had to go to New Jersey, you know, Manhattan. So I had to take a link tunnel. And as the taxi's approaching the tunnel, I said, the guy, I can't do it. I can't do it. And the guy says, well, I can't let you out. It's illegal to let you out. I said, you got to let me out. I can't do it. And I just opened the door and I got out. Oh my god. That's so crazy. But now we find with tunnels. So I don't know what it is that maybe you're too smart. It's more accentuated it there. Maybe you're too slow. And maybe you're playing tricks with you and giving you anxiety to sort of shake it up the world. Yeah, maybe you're maybe constantly contemplating the gigantic picture of actual scope of the universe. Yeah. But now I'm pretty stable about these things. So it's just MRI machines. It's really close into your face. Well, you got to just do a lot of MRIs. Get over the right exact. I'm sure that that would do it. That would absolutely do it. Probably. If you still MRIs on a regular basis. Then I'm sure you get used to it. But yeah, I just I just do a real simple type of meditation. When I I probably eventually going to take a TM course because my friend Tom Papa, he's a really into TM and he he raves about it. Yeah. But I just sit down and I breathe. I just concentrate only on my breath. And I and it comes in goes but I concentrate only on my breath. And I find really good relief from that yoga is the same thing. I do yoga. I try to do at least twice a week when I do. Yeah. That there's a lot of benefit in that in the same way. In that it's so difficult. And in the poses. If you can only concentrate on your breath. Just balance and concentrate on your breath. You'll be filled with activity and enough with the with things to concentrate on with the balancing of the posture and then the breath that it it acts as a almost a brain scouring. It cleanses the mind of unnecessary anxiety and a lot of other just but you've been doing that for a long time. Yeah. I just do it. No yoga has been I've been pretty steady for the last four years. Right. Right. Yeah. And my wife does a lot of yoga. She keeps telling me that I need to do it. It's great. You know, it's great. It's great for the body as well. And I think the more comfortable your body is the better you're at least for me. Yeah. The better my mind got a little doubt. Do you know, last year been doing Peloton bike? That's good. But then I hurryed at a disk in my back and it's for last two months. I've basically been unable to move. How did you do that? Well, you know, I think it was thrown out the Christmas tree. You know, the bending end and you know, my 92 year old mother has used his opportunity to say because we're in Jewish. We were an allowed to have a Christmas tree going up. You know, this is this is this is meaningful right here. You know, you know, my my Christian wife is all too happy that that I'm flexible on that count for sure. What is going on with your back now? Yeah. Well, it's it's bad. It's bad. Did you get a number? I did get a mirror. I was saying for sure to say it. Yeah. So I'm I'm this is pushing it's the nerves pushing it's the nerve. Yeah. Have you heard of something called regeneranachine? Do you know what that means? No, I don't. Regenicine is something that I used for a bulging desk and it's incredibly beneficial. It's it was created by a doctor in Germany and it was illegal in the United States until a few years back. They they move the process of here. It's not covered by insurance, but it's very, very beneficial for that. And what they do is it's essentially a more advanced version of platelet rich plasma. So they take your blood out. They do this process. It takes about 12 hours and then they re inject this serum. They take the serum out of the blood. It looks like this yellow serum and they inject it directly into the areas and it's right into the spine. Right into the area where the spine is bulging. So although and it allows it to relax. It's the most potent anti-inflammation drug that they can they can use. It's like instead of cortisome, which is exactly what they're talking about. Exactly. Well, cortisome can help you as well. At least provide temporary relief. But what this does is actually heals the area. Really? Yeah. It's very beneficial. I had a real bad bulging disk in my neck that was making my hands go numb. So my toes are numb. Yeah. Yeah. But they can give you relief. And it's in Santa Monica. There's a place called lifespan medicine. I'll connect you to the doctor. Yeah, I'm so curious about what it is. I just said a friend of mine. Yeah. He had a real problem with his neck within two weeks. It was better. He got hit by a car when he was on his motorcycle. My friend Dean Del Rey and he was really fucked up. His back was so bad that like we were at the Communist Party and I'm like people came near him and he tensed up like what's the matter? He was dude. My neck is so messed up. Somebody bumps into me. I'm in sharp pain. Yeah. And I'm like really. And then he started describing to me. So I said, I've got the thing for you. And I sent him to this place. Regenicine's amazing. I've had it done several times. I've had it done on my lower. Well, a lot of like athletes like Peyton Manning and Kobe Bryant, they they flew to Germany to get this procedure done because it's a place to sleep a little bit. Including the UFC president Dana White, which is where I found out about it. And then I found out that they were opening offices in America and Dallas, they have one, they have one in Santa Monica and I think somewhere else. Maybe New York maybe. Maybe. Yeah, but it's an amazing procedure. I mean, it really is super beneficial particularly for that kind of an issue. Because it's been tough. I mean, for instance, I can't sleep because there's no position. Yeah. Now the value of that is, I have done so much reading over the last two months because I'm like up half the night and I only can't count out when it's like utter utter exhaustion. But then you spinal decompression of you've ever done either. I did. I went to this physical therapy place where they put me up on pulleys and it kind of pulled the feet, I guess, away from the back. It wasn't like being stretched fully, but your own weight was causing the vertebraid to separate. Did that help? Huge relief. Yeah, that you can get a small inversion table. Yeah, thinking about that. Yeah, well, I have one of here. You could do it too. Yeah, I love Jim right here. There's another thing called the reverse hyper machine. And the reverse hyper machine was created by this, these are very famous power lifter named Louis Simmons and Louis had this idea. He's a very brilliant guy and he had this idea that they were trying to fuse his discs. He had a bulging disc. He said, well, a disc is compressed. Like how do you get it to decompress? And he developed a machine that strengthens the back when you lift up the legs, but then in the lowering of the legs, it provides active decompression. And it alleviated his problem. Do you wear this? No, I'll show too. I'll show it to you afterwards. It's a machine that you get. But see we are physical beings, right? We have a mind that can sort of the edge of the cosmos, but you got a bulging disc. It doesn't matter. Oh, yeah, it is real. I mean, you have to deal with it. And you have to be really careful. And for me, what's really critical is physical maintenance. And I'm very dedicated to physical maintenance, even if there's nothing wrong. So if I was building the core, yeah, I'd say there are a lot of chin ups, sit ups, a lot of lower back exercises, a hyper, like back extensions, anything to keep things strong, squats, make sure that the more tissue you have, the more strength you have in that tissue around, particularly protecting your joints and your spine, the healthier you're going to be. Yes, just not. It's absolutely vital because the last few months have been hell. I have to say, well, show you. Listen, we've very talked for two and a half hours. So I'll take you back in the next one. Yeah, let's show you. Yeah. Brian, thank you very much for being here. I really appreciate you. You appreciate all your work and tell people your book, one more time is the title. And till the end of time, it's out today. It's out today. It's a mind matter and our search for meaning in and evolving universe. Yeah. Thank you for being here. Thank you, my pleasure. Bye, everybody. Here's one. Yeah, I love you. Thank you.
