 The following is a conversation with Roger Panros, physicist, mathematician, and philosopher at University of Oxford. He has made fundamental contributions in many disciplines from the mathematical physics of general relativity and cosmology to the limitations of computational view of consciousness. In his book, the Emperor's New Mind, Roger writes that, quote, children are not afraid to pose basic questions that may embarrass us as adults to ask. In many ways, my goal with this podcast is to embrace the inner child that is not constrained by how one should behave, speak, and think in the adult world. Roger is one of the most important minds of our time, so it was truly a pleasure and an honor to talk with them. This conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the pandemic.

And now, here's my conversation with Roger Penrose. You mentioned in conversation with Eric Weissstein on the portal podcast that 2001 Space Odyssey is your favorite movie. Which aspect, if you could mention of its representation of artificial intelligence, science, engineering, connected with you? There were also some scenes there, which is so amazing. And how they science was so well done. I mean, people say, you know, you interstellar, this amazing movie, which is the most scientific movie. I thought it's not a patch on 2001. They really went into also to details. And they're getting the free fall well done. And if anything, I thought it was streaming well done. So just the details were my mind rising. I don't know if there's things like the scene where at the beginning they have these sort of human ancestors, which is sort of eight, eight becoming monolith. Yes. And well, it's the one where he throws the bone up into the air. And then it becomes this, I mean, there's less than amazing sequence there. What do you make of the monolith? Does it have any scientific or philosophical meaning to you? Does kind of think of the most box innovation? Not really. That comes from Artistic Clark. I was always a great fan about the Clark. So it's just a nice plot device. Yeah, another plot is excellent. Yes. How 9,000 decides to get rid of the astronauts because he, it, she believes that they will interfere with the mission. That's right. Yes. Oh, it's this view. I don't know whether I disagree with it question to certain sense. It was telling you it's wrong. See, the, the machine seemed to think it was a superior to the human. And so it was entitled to get rid of the human beings and run the show itself. What do you think how did the right thing? Do you think how is flawed evil or if we think about systems like how, would we want how to do the same thing in the future? What was the flaw there? Well, you're basically questioning, touching on questions. You see, it's one supposed to believe that how was actually conscious. I mean, it was played rather that way as though how was a conscious being because how was showed some pain, some cognitive, the hell appeared to be cognizant of what it means to die. Yes. And therefore had that. That's really, yes. And the inkling of conscious. Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure that aspect of it was made completely clear whether how was really adjusted, very sophisticated computer, which really didn't actually have these feelings and somehow. If you're right, it didn't make the idea being turned off. How does it change things if how was it wasn't conscious? Well, it might say that it would be wrong to turn it off if it was actually conscious. I mean, these questions arise, if you think, I mean, AI wanted the idea. It's sort of a mixture in a sense. You say, if it's trying to do everything a human can do, and if you take the view that consciousness is something which would come along, when the computer is sufficiently complicated, sufficiently whatever, criteria and you use to characterize its consciousness in terms of some computational criterion. So how does consciousness change our evaluation of the decision that hell made? Yeah. I guess I've started to say that people have been confused about this. Because if they say these machines will overcome conscious, but just simply because it's a degree of computation. And when you get beyond that, it's a certain degree of computation. It will overcome conscious. Then of course you have all these problems. I mean, you might say, well, one of the reasons you're doing AI is because you're going to send a device out to some distant planet. And you don't want to send a human out there because then you have to bring it back again. And that's cost you far more than just sending it there and leaving it there. But if this device is actually a conscious entity, then you have to face up to the fact that that's immoral. And so the mere fact that you're making some AI device and getting a thinking that removes your responsibility to it would be incorrect. And so this is a sort of flaw in that kind of viewpoint. I'm not sure how people who take it very seriously. I'm going to have this curious conversation with, I'm going to forget names and I'm afraid because this is what happens to me at the right moment. How stuttered. Douglas. Douglas. And he'd written this book, God, I like that. Well, I wish I liked that. I thought it was a fantastic book. But I didn't agree with his conclusion from God or Stephen. I think he'd gone it wrong. You see? Well, I just tell you my story, you see, because I'd never met him. And then I knew I was going to meet him. The occasion, I really excuse coming in, you want to talk to me and that's fine. And I thought in my mind, well, I'm going to paint him into a corner, you see? You see, his arguments to convince him that certain numbers are conscious. You know, some integers, large enough integers are actually conscious. And this was going to be my reductive, I had a certain. So I started having this argument with him. He simply leapt into the corner. He didn't even need to be painted into it. He took the view of it, said, numbers were conscious. I thought that was the reductive I'd have said them. But he seemed to think it was perfectly reasonable point to do. Without the absurdum there, yes, interesting. But the thing you mentioned about how is the intuition that a lot of the people at least in the artificial intelligence world had and have, I think, they don't make it explicit, but that if you increase the power of computation naturally consciousness will emerge. Yeah, so I think that's what they think. Basically, that's because they can't think of anything else. Well, that's right. And so it's a reasonable thing. I mean, you think what the brain do, does do a lot of computation. I think most of what you actually call computation is done by the cerebellum. I mean, this is one of the things that people don't much mention. I'm going to come to this subject from the outside and certain things strike me, which you hardly ever hear mentioned. I mean, you heard mentioned about the left-right business thing. You move your right arm, that's your left side of the brain. And so, I'm all that sort of stuff. And it's more than that if you have this plot of different parts of the brain, there are two of these things called the homoncular, which you see these pictures of a distorted human figure and showing different parts of the brain controlling different parts of the body. And it's not simply things like, okay, the right hand is controlled and sense both sensory and motor on the left side, left hand on the right side. It's more than that. Vision is at the back, basically. Your feet at the top. And since it's about the worst organization you're going to make them. Right. So it can't just be a mistake in nature. There's something going on there. And this is made more pronounced when you think of the cerebellum. And cerebellum has, when I was first thinking about these things, I, this told it had half as many neurons or something like that. Compromise. And now they tell me it's got far more neurons than the cere, the cerebrum. The cerebrum is this sort of convoluted thing at the top. People will be talking about. cerebellum is this thing. She's just a bit like a ball of wool. Right. It's the back underneath. It's got more neurons. It's got more connections. Computationally, it's got much more going on. And this, from this cerebrum. But as far as we know, it's slightly controversial. cerebellum is entirely unconscious. So the actions you have are, it's a pianist who can play as an incredible piece of music and think of any moves this little finger into this little key to get a hit it just the right moment. Does he or she consciously will that movement? No. OK, the consciousness is coming in. It's probably to do with a feeling of the piece of music. This is being performed in that sort of thing, which is going on. But the details and what's going on are controlled. I would think almost entirely by the cerebellum. That's where you have this precision and the really detailed. Once you get, I mean, you think of a tennis player or something. Does that tennis player think exactly how the, which muscles should be moved in what direction is so enough? Of course not. But he or she will maybe think well if the ball is angles in such a way and that corner, that will be tricky for the opponent. And the details of that are all done largely with the cerebellum. So that's where we'll have precise motions. But it's unconscious. So why is it interesting to you that so much computation is done in the cerebellum and yet is unconscious? Because it's the view that somehow it's computation, which is producing the consciousness. And it's here you have an incredible amount of computation going on. And as far as we know, it's completely unconscious. So why, what's the difference? And I think it's an important thing. What's the difference? Why is the cerebellum? But all this very peculiar stuff that very hard to see on a computational perspective, like having the everything have to cross over under the other size and do something which looks completely inefficient. And you've got funny things like the frontal lobe and the, what a pretire, what do we call the lobes? And the place where they come together, you have the different parts, the control. You see one to do with motor and the other to do with sensory. And there's sort of opposite each other rather than being connected by a new, but it's not just though you've got the electrical circuits. There's something else going on there. So it's just the idea that it's like a complicated computer just seems to me to be completely missing the point. There must be a lot of computation going on. But the cerebellum seems to be much better at doing that than the cerebellum is. So for sure, I think what explains it is, it's like half hope and half we don't know what's going on and therefore from the computer science perspective, you hope that a touring machine can be perfectly and achieve general intelligence. Well, you have this wonderful thing about during and Gertal and church and Cary and various people, particularly touring. And I guess post was the other one. These people who developed the idea of what a computation is. And there were different ideas of what a computer developed differently. I have a church as well, I've done it. It was very different from touring. But then they were shown to be equivalent. And so the view emerged that what we mean by a computation is a very clear concept. And one of the wonderful things that touring did was to show that you could have what we call the Universal touring machine. You just have to have a certain finite device. Okay, it has to have an unlimited storage space, which is accessible to it. But the actual computation, if you like, is performed by this one universal device. And so the view comes away. Well, you have this universal touring machine. And maybe the brain is something like that. The universal touring machine and it's got maybe not an unlimited storage, but a huge storage accessible through it. And this model is one, which is what's used in ordinary computation. That's a very powerful model. And the Universalness of computation is very useful. You can have some problem and you may not see immediately how to put it onto a computer. If it is something of that nature, then how there were sort of sub-programs and sub-retains were normally, I mean, I learned a little bit of computing when I was a student, but not very much. But it was enough to get the general ideas. And there's something really pleasant about a formal system like that. Where you can start discussing about what's approval, what's not these kinds of things. And you've got a notion, which is an absolute notion, this notion of computability. And the unitability. It rests when things, mathematical problems are computably solvable and much aren't. So, it's a very beautiful area of mathematics. And it's a very powerful area of mathematics. And it underlies the whole sort of, I won't say, about the principles of computing machines that we have today. Could you say what is Gators and Compliteness theorem and how does it, maybe also, say, is it heartbreaking to you? And how does it interfere with this notion of computation? And it's not just consciousness. Sure. The idea is basically ideas, which I formulated and my first year as a graduate student in Cambridge. I did my undergraduate work in mathematics in London. And I had a colleague in person, we used to discuss things like computational and logical systems quite a lot. I'd heard about Gators theorem, I'd have been worried by the idea that it seemed to say there were things in mathematics that you could never prove. And so, when I went to Cambridge as a graduate student, I went to various courses. You see, I was doing pure mathematics. I was doing algebraic geometry. I was sort, a little bit different from my super-version people. But it was an algebraic geometry. And I was interested, I got particularly interested in three lecture courses that were nothing to do with what I was supposed to be doing. One was a course by Hermann Bundy on Einstein's general theory of relativity, which was a beautiful course. He was an amazing lecturer. brought these things alive, absolutely. And now there was a course on quantum mechanics, given by the great physicist Paul Dirac, very beautiful course, in a completely different way. It was very kind of organized and never got excited about anything seemingly. But it was extremely well put together and I found that amazing too. Third course, it was nothing to do with what I should be doing, was a course on mathematical logic. And I got, as I say, my discussions with the impertible. Was the incomplete and sterome already deeply within mathematical logic space? Were you introduced in detail by the course by Stine? And it was two things he described, which were very fundamental to my understanding. One was two machines and the whole idea of computability and all that. So that was all very much part of the course. The other one was the girl of the era. And it wasn't what I was afraid it was to tell you there were things in mathematics you couldn't prove. It was basically, and he phrased it in a way, which often people didn't. And if you read Douglas Hofstadis book, he doesn't, you see. But Stine made it very clear. And also in a sort of public lecture that he gave to a mathematical, I think maybe the Adam Society, one of the, the mathematical undergraduates societies. And he made this point again very clearly that if you've got a formal system of proof. So suppose what you mean by proof is something which you could check with a computer. So to say whether you've got it right or not, you've got a lot of steps. Have you carried this computational procedure? Well, following the proof steps of the proof correctly, that can be checked by an algorithm by a computer. That's the key thing. Now what you have to, now you see, is this any good? If you've got an algorithmic system, which claims to say yes, this is right, this you've proved it correctly, this is true. If you've proved it, if you made it mistake, it doesn't say it's true or false, but if you have, if you've done it right, then the conclusion you've come to is correct. Now you say, why do you believe it's correct? Because you looked at the rules and you said, well, okay, that one's all right. Yeah, that one's all right. What about that? I'm not sure. Yeah, I see. I see what it's all right. Okay. You go through all the rules. You say, yes, following those rules, if it says yes, it's true, it is true. So you've got to make sure that these rules are ones that you trust. Is if you follow the rules and it says it's a proof, is the result actually true? And that your belief that it's true depends upon looking at the rules and understanding them. Now what girl or shows that if you have such a system, then you can construct a statement of the very kind that it's supposed to look at a mathematical statement. And you can see, by the way, it's constructed and what it means that it's true, but not proveable by the rules that you've been given. And it depends on your trust in the rules. Do you believe that the rules only give you truth? If you believe the rules only give you truth, then you believe this other statement is also true. I found this absolutely mind-blowing. When I saw this, it blew my mind. But my God, you can see that this statement is true. It's as good as any proof, because it only depends on your belief in the reliability of the proof procedure. That's all it is. And understanding that the coding is done correctly, and it enables you to transcend that system. So whatever system you have, as long as you can understand what it's doing and why you believe it only gives you truth, then you can see beyond that system. How do you see beyond it? What is it? It enables you to transcend that system. Well, it's your understanding of what the system is actually saying and what the statement that you've constructed is actually staying. So it's this quality of understanding, whatever it is, which is not governed by rules. It's not a computational procedure. So this idea of understanding is now going to be within the rules of the, within the formal system. Yes, that comes from a rules. That comes from a rules. Anyway, because you have understood them to be rules, which only give you truth. There be no pointing it otherwise. I'm going to people say, well, okay, this says, well, once that the rules is good as any other way, it's not true. You say, you have to understand what the rules mean. And why does that understanding of the mean? Give you something beyond the rules themselves. And that's what it was. That's what blew my mind. It somehow, that's adding why the rules give you truth, enables you to transcend the rules. So that's where, I mean, even at that time, that's already where the thought entered your mind that the idea of understanding or we can start calling it things like intelligence or even consciousness is outside the rules. Yes, since I've always concentrated on understanding, you know, people say, people sometimes point out things, well, we know what our creativity, that's something a machine can't do is create. Well, I don't know. What is creativity? And I don't know. I mean, somebody can put some funny things on a piece of paper and say, that's creative. And you could make a machine do that. Does it really create it? I don't know. You say, I'm worried about that one. I sort of agree with it in a sense, but it's so hard to do anything with that statement. But understanding, yes, you can. You can make go see that understanding, whatever it is. And it's very hard to put your finger on it. That's absolutely true. Can you try to define or maybe dance around a definition of understanding? To some degree, but I don't, I often wonder about this, but there is something there, which is very slippery. It's something like standing back. And it's got to be something, it's also got to be something which was a value to our remote ancestors. Because sometimes there's a cartoon, which I drew sometimes showing you how all these, there's a in the foreground. You see this mathematician just doing some mathematical theorem. There's a little bit different joke in that into that. He's tried to prove some theorem. And he's about to be eaten by a saboteuse tiger, who's hiding in the underground, you see. And in the distance, you see his cousins building growing crops, building shelters, domesticating animals. And in this type of foreground, you see they build a mammoth trap and this coral mammoth is falling into a pit. You see, and all these people around them are about to grab him, you see. And well, you see those are the ones who the quality of understanding, which goes with all, it's not just the mathematician doing his mathematics. This understanding quality is something else, which is being a tremendous advantage to us, not just to us. See, I don't think consciousness is limited to humans. That's the interesting question, at which point, if it is, indeed connected to the evolutionary process, at which point did we pick up this very hard question? It's certainly, I don't think it's primates, you see these pictures of African hunting dogs and how they can plan amongst themselves, how to catch the antelopes. Some of these David Attenborough films, I think it's probably was one of them. And you can see the hunting dogs, and they divide themselves into two groups, and they go into roots, two different roots. One of them goes and they sort of hide next to the river. And the other group goes around and they start yelping at these, then embark, I guess, what if a noise hunting dogs do? The antelopes and they sort of round them up and they chase them in the direction of the river. And they're the other ones just waiting for them just to get because when they get to the river it slows them down. And so they plant on them. So they've obviously planned this all out. Somehow, I have no idea how. And there is some element of conscious planning, as far as I can see, I don't think it's just some kind of, so much of AI these days is done, I wonder what they call bottom-up systems. Is it, wouldn't yeah, where you have neural networks and they, and they you give them a zillion different things to look at and, and then they sort of, you can choose one thing over another, this because it's seeing so many examples and picks up on the rules, signals, which you want to not even be conscious of. And that doesn't feel like understanding. And there's no understanding and that whatsoever. So while you're being a little bit human centric, so well, I'm going to talk about, yeah, not with the dogs ever. No, you're not. So I say not human centric, but I'm in spoke by a lot, by a logic centric. Is it possible that consciousness would just look slightly different? Well, I'm not saying it's biological because we don't know. I think other examples of the elephants is a wonderful example too. Where they, this was, I think this was an item for one. Where the elephant has to go from the long, the trooper's and have to go long distances. And the leader of a trooper is a female. They all are apparently. And this female that she had to go all the way from one part of the country to another. And as a certain point, she made a detour and they went off in this big detour. All the trooper came with her and this was where her sister had died. And there were her bones lying around and they go and pick up the bones and they hand it around and they caress the bones. And then they put them back and they will go back again. What do we have now they're doing? That's a lot of interesting. I mean, there's something going on. There's no clear connection with natural selection. There's just some deep feeling going on there. We have to do with their conscious experience. And I think it's something that you overall have advantages. I'm not a trocese election, but not directly to do with natural selection. I like that there's something going on going on there. Like I told you, I'm Russian, so I tend to romanticise all things of this nature that that is not merely cold, hard computation. Perhaps I could just lightly answer your question. You were asking me, what is it? There's something about sort of standing back and thinking about your and thought processes. And there is something like that in the gut or thing, because it's you're not following the rules. You're standing back and thinking about the rules. And so there is something that you might say, you think about you're doing something. Anything, what the hell am I doing? And you sort of stand back and think about what it is that's making you think such a way. Just take a step back outside this the game you've been playing. Yeah, you're back up and you think about you're just not playing the game anymore. You're thinking about what the hell you're doing in playing this game. And that's somehow, it's not a very precise discovery, but somehow feels very true that that's somehow understanding this kind of reflection. The reflection, yes. Yeah. There is a bit hard to put your finger on, but there is something there, which I think maybe could be unearthed at some point and see this is really what's going on. Why conscious beings have this advantage? What it is that gives them advantage. And I think it goes way back. I don't think we're talking about the hunting dogs and the elephants. That's pretty clear that octopus is the same sort of quality. And we call it consciousness. Yeah, I think so. It's seen enough examples of the way that they behave and the evolution route is completely different. That's a good way back to some common ancestor or did it come separately. My hope is that something simple, but the hard question if there's a hardware pre-requisite, we have to develop some kind of hardware mechanisms in our computers. Like basically, as you suggest, we'll get to in a second, we kind of have to throw away the computers we know today. Yeah. The deterministic machines we know today that try to create it. I mean, my hope of course is not, but when I see I should go really back to the story, which in a sense I haven't finished, because I went to these three courses. You see, when I was a graduate student. And so I started to think, well, I'm really, I'm a pretty what you might call a materialist in the sense of thinking that there's no kind of mystical or something around it, which comes in from Boonos where you still that, you still throw your life in a mental form. I don't like the word materialist, because it's just we know what material is. And that's, that is a bad word because there's no mystical. It's not something which is not not treatable by science. It's so beautifully put just a pause in there for a second. Your materialist, but you acknowledge that we don't really know what the materialist. That's right. I mean, I like to call myself a scientist, that's the most, but it means that, yes, well, you see, the question goes on here. So I began thinking, okay, if consciousness or understanding is something which is not a computational process, what can it be? And I knew enough from my undergraduate work, I knew about Newtonian mechanics, and I knew how basically you could put it on a computer. There is a fundamental issue, which is it's important or not, that computation depends upon discrete things. So you're using discrete elements, whereas the physical law is dependent on the continuum. Is this something to do with it? Is it the fact that we're used to continuum in our physics? And if we model our physical system or used to discrete systems like ordinary computers, I came to the view that that's probably not it. I might have to retract on that someday, but the view was, you can get close enough. It's not all together clear, I have to say, but you can get close enough. And you know, I went to this course on by Bondi on general activity, and I thought, well, you can put that on a computer, because that was a long time before people, I thought it'd grown up with it, it's how people have done better and better calculations, and they could work out black, about black holes, and they can then work out how black holes can interact with each other, spare around, and more kind of gravitational waves can add. And it's a very impressive piece of computational work, how you can actually work out the shapes of those signals. And now we have like, oh, seeing these signals. And they say, yeah, there's a black hole spiral into each other. This is just a vindication of the power of computation, in describing and sounds general activity. So in that case, we can get close. But we, the, the, the wood computation, we can get close to understanding the physics. You can get very close. Now, is that close enough, you see? And then I went to this course by D'Irak. Now, you see, I think it was the very first lecture that he gave, and he was talking about the superposition principle. And he said, if you have a particle, you usually think of particle can be over here or over there, but in quantum mechanics, it can be over here and over there at the same time. And you have these states which involve a superposition in some sense of it different locations for that particle. And then you go out at his piece of chalk. Some people say, brok it in two is a kind of illustration of how the piece of chalk might be over here and over there at the same time. And he was talking about this, and I, my mind wandered. I don't remember what he said. Well, I can remember, he just moved on to the next topic. And something about energy he'd mentioned, which I have no idea what he'd had to do with anything. And so I'd been struck with this and worried about it ever since. It's probably just as well. I didn't hear his explanation because it was probably one of these things to calm me down and not worry about it anymore. Whereas in my case, I've worried about it ever since. So I thought, maybe that's the catch. There is something in quantum mechanics. Where these superpositions become one or the other. And that's not part of quantum mechanics. There's something missing in the theory. The theory is incomplete. It's not just incomplete. It's in a certain sense, not quite right. Because if you follow the equation, the basic equation of quantum mechanics, that's just routing the equation. You could put that on a computer too. There are lots of difficulties about how many parameters you have to put in. So that can be very tricky. But nevertheless, it is a computational process. Margie Lowe, this question about the continuum that's before, but it's not clear that makes any difference. So our theories of quantum mechanics may be missing the same element that the universal term machine is missing about consciousness. Yeah, this is the viewer I held is that you need a theory. And that what, on people call the reduction of the stage, or the collapse of the wave function, which you have to have, otherwise quantum mechanics doesn't relate to the world we see. To make it relate to the world we see, you've got to break the quantum, you've got to break the shroening of the equation. Shroening himself was absolutely followed by this idea. His own equation. That's why introduced this famous shroening as cat. There's a thought experiment. He's really saying, look, this is where my equation leads you into it. There's something wrong. Something we haven't understood, which is basically fundamental. And so I was trying to put all these things together and said, well, it's got to be the non-competitive community comes in there. And I also can't quite remember when I thought this, but it's when gravity is involved in quantum mechanics. It's the combination of those two, and at that point, when you have good reasons to believe, this came much later. But I have good reason to believe, that the principles of general relativity and those of quantum mechanics, most particularly, it's the basic principle of equivalence which goes back to Galileo. If you fall freely, you eliminate the gravitational field. So you imagine Galileo dropping his big rock and his little rock from the leaning tower, whether he actually ever did that or not, it's pretty irrelevant. And as the rocks fall to the ground, you'll have a little insect sitting on one of them looking at the other one. And it seems to think, oh, there's no gravity here. Of course, it hits the ground, and then it realized something's different going on. But when it's in free fall, the gravity is been eliminated. Galileo understood that very beautifully. He gives his wonderful examples of fireworks. And you see the fireworks and explode and you see the sphere of sparkling fireworks, and it remains as fear as it falls down, as though there were no gravity. So he understood that principle, but he couldn't make a theory out of it. Einstein came along, used exactly the same principle, and that's the basis of Einstein's general theory of relativity. Now, there is a conflict, this is something I didn't much much later, so this wasn't those days, much much later. You can see there is a basic conflict between the principle of superposition, I think that drag was talking about, and the principle of general cove, and well, principle of equivalence. Gravitational fields equivalent to an acceleration. Can you pause for a second, what is the principle of the cove lines? It's this Galileo principle that we can eliminate least locally. You have to be in a small neighborhood, because if you have people dropping rocks all around the world somewhere, you can't get rid of it all at once. But in the local neighborhood, you can eliminate the gravitational fields by falling freely with it. And we now see there with astronauts, and they don't, you know, the Earth is right there, you can see the great global VR-thrite, but they don't care about it, as far as they're concerned, there's no gravity. They fall freely in the gravitational field, and that gets rid of the gravitational field. And that's the principle of equivalence. So what's the contradiction, what's the tension, what's the tension, what's the supposition, and let's go to the next one. So we, just a bad track for a second, just to see if we can weave a thread through it all. Yes. So we started to think about consciousness as potentially needing us some of the same, not mystical, but some of the same imagine. You see, there's a complicated story. So people think I'm drifting away from the point or something, but I think it is a complicated story. So what I'm trying to say, I'm trying to put it in a nutshell, it's not so easy. I'm trying to say that whatever consciousness is, it's not a computation. Yes. Or it's not a physical process, which can be described by computation. But it nevertheless could be, so one of the interesting models that you've proposed is the orchestrated objective reduction, which is, you see, that's going from there, you say. So I say, I have no idea. So I wrote this book through my scientific career. I thought, you know, when I'm retired, I have enough time to write a sort of a popular book, which I will explain my ideas and puzzles. What I like, beautiful things about physics and mathematics, and this puzzle about computability and consciousness and so on. And in the process of writing this book, well, I thought I'd do it when I was retired. I didn't actually, I wouldn't wait that long because there was a radio discussion between Edward Fredkin and Marvin Minsky. And they were talking about what computers could do, and they were entering a big room, and I imagine entering a big room with the other end of the room, two computers were talking to each other. And as you walk up to the computers, they will have communicated to each other more ideas, concepts, things, than the entire human race had ever commuted that. So I thought, well, I know you're coming from, but I just don't believe you. There's something missing. That's not, that, so I thought, well, I should write my book. And so I did. It was roughly the same time Stephen Hawking, this writing his brief history of time, and 80s at some point. The book you've talked about was the Emperor's New York. And both are an incredible book, the brief history of time in Emperor's New mind. Yes, it was quite interesting because he told me he'd got some Carl Sagan, I think, to write a forward. Good, so the book you see, so I thought, gosh, what am I going to do? I'm not going to get anywhere unless I get somebody. So I said, oh, I know Martin Gardener, so I wonder if he did. So he did, and he did a very nice forward. So that's an incredible book, and some of the, this is the same people we mentioned Ed Franken, which I guess of ex-persystems, fame, and men's key, of course, people know in the AI world, but they represent the artificial intelligence world that do hope and dream that AI's intelligence is. Well, you see, it was my thinking, well, you know, I see where they're coming from, and I, from that perspective. Yeah, you're right, but that's not my perspective. So I thought, I had to say it. And as I was writing my book, you see, I thought, well, I don't really know anything about neurophysiology. What am I doing right? I mean, it's book. So I started reading up about neurophysiology and I read how I'm not trying to find out, well, how it is that nerve signals could possibly preserve quantum coherence. And all I read is that the sit and electrical signals which go along the nerves create effects through the brain. There's no chance you can isolate it. So this is hopeless. So I come to the end of the book, and I'm more or less give up. I just think of something which I didn't believe in. That's maybe this is a way around it, but no. And then you say, I thought, well, maybe this book, at least stimulate young people who do science or something. And I got all these letters from old retired people instead. There's not only people who could have had time to read my book. So I mean, except for Stuart Hammer off. That's except for Stuart Hammer. Stuart Hammer off wrote to me, and he said, I think you're missing something. You don't know about my criteria. You didn't put it quite like that. But that was more or less it. And he said, this is what you really need to consider. So I thought my God. Yes, that's a much more promising structure. So I mean, fundamentally, you were searching for the source of non-computable source of consciousness within the human brain in the biology. And so what are my, if I may ask, what are my curtubials? Well, you see, I was ignorant and what I'd read. I never came across them in the book. So it looked at. Perhaps I only read rather superficially, which is true. But I just know about my criteria. Stuart, I think one of the things here was impressed him about them. When you see pictures of my toses, that's a cell, divide it. And you see all the chromosomes. And the chromosomes get, they're all get line up and then they get pulled apart. And so that as the cell divides, the half the chromosomes go, you know, how they're divided into the two paths. And they go two different ways. And what is it that's pulling them apart? Well, the host of these social things got micro-tubials. And so he starts to get interested in them. And he formed the view when he was, and his day job or night job or whatever, because it just put people to sleep, except he doesn't like calling the sleep because it's different. General anesthetics in a reversible way. So you want to make sure that they don't experience the pain that with other words be something that they feel. And consciousness is turned off for a while and it can be turned back on again. So it's crucial that you can turn it off and turn it on. And what do you do when you're doing that? What do general anesthetic gases do? And see, he formed the view that it's the micro-tubials, the effect. And the details of why he formed that view is not what the clever clear to me, but there's an interesting story he keeps talking about. But I found this very exciting because I thought these structures, these little tubes, which inhabit pretty well ourselves. It's not just neurons. Apart from red blood cells, they inhabit pretty well all the other cells in the body. But they're not all the same kind. You get different kinds of micro-tubials. And the ones that excited me the most, this is may still not be totally clear. But the ones that excited me most were the ones that the only ones that I knew about at the time because they were the very, very symmetrical structures. And I had reason to believe that these very symmetrical structures would be much better at preserving a quantum state, quantum coherence, preserving the thing without you just need to preserve certain degrees of freedom without them leaking into the environment. Once they leak into the environment, you're lost. So you have to preserve these quantum states at a level, which the state reduction process comes in. And that's where I think the norm of computeability comes in. And it's the measurement process in quantum mechanics. What's going on? So something about the measure of process and what's going on, something about the structure or the micro-tubials, your intuition says, maybe there's something here. Maybe this kind of structure allows for the the mystery of the there was a much better chance. Yeah, so it just struck me that partly it was the symmetry because there is a feature of symmetry you can preserve quantum coherence much better with symmetrical structures. There's that there is a good reason for that. And that impressed me a lot. I didn't know the difference between the A-Lighters and B-Lighters at that time, which could be important. Now that could be, that's the, which isn't talked about but that's some in some sense details. We've got to take a step back just to say these people are not familiar. So this, this, this was called the orchestrated objective reduction idea or or OR, which is a biological philosophy of mine that postulates the consciousness originates at the quantum levels, it's a neuron. So that has to do with your search for where where is it coming from. So that's counter to the notion that consciousness may arise from the computation performed by the synapses. Yes, the key point. Sometimes people say, it's because it's quantum mechanical. It's not just that. See, it's more outrageous than that. You see, this is one reason I think we're so far off from it because we don't even know the physics right. You see, it's not just quantum mechanics. People say, oh, you know quantum systems and biological structures, no, will you? It's starting to see that some basic biological systems does depend on quantum, I mean, well, in first place, all of chemistry is quantum mechanics. People got used to that, so they don't count that. So it's not count, let's not count, quantum chemistry. We sort of got the hang of that, I think. But you have quantum effects, which are not just chemical, in photosynthesis. And this is one of the striking things in the last several years, that photosynthesis seems to be a basically quantum process, which is not simply a chemical. It's using quantum mechanics in a very basic way. So you could start saying, oh, well, with photosynthesis, based on quantum mechanics, why not, uh, behavior of neurons and things like that? Maybe there's something which is like photosynthesis in that respect. But what I'm saying is even more outrageous than that because those things are talking about conventional quantum mechanics. Now, my argument says that conventional quantum mechanics, if you're just following the shortening of equation, that's still computable. So you've got to go beyond that. So you've got to go to where quantum mechanics goes wrong in a certain sense. You have to be a little bit careful about that, because the way people do quantum mechanics is a sort of mixture of two different processes. One of them is the Schrodinger equation, which is an equation, a Schrodinger wrote down, and it tells you how the state of assistant evolves. In his evolved according to his equation, completely deterministic, but it involves interredicular situations. And this was what Schrodinger was very much pointing out with his cat. He says, you follow my equation, that's Schrodinger's equation, and you could say that you have to, you have a cat, a cat which is dead in the live at the same time. That would be the evolution of the Schrodinger equation, but lead to a state, which is the quick cat being dead under the live at the same time. And he's more or less saying, this is an absurdity. People nowadays say, oh, what Schrodinger said, you can have a cat which is dead, let's not, let's see, he was saying, this is an absurdity. There's something missing and that the reduction of the state or the collapse of the wave function or whatever it is, it's something which has to be understood. It's not following the Schrodinger equation. It's not the way we conventionally do quantum mechanics. There's something more than that, and it's easy to quote or authority here because Einstein, at least three of the greatest physicists of 20th century, who were very fundamental in developing quantum mechanics, Einstein, one of them, Schrodinger and other, Dirac and other. You have to look carefully, Dirac's writing because he didn't tend to say this out loud too much because he was very cautious about what he said. You find the right place and you see, he says quantum mechanics is a provisional theory. To be need something which explains the collapse of the wave function. We need to go beyond the theory we have now. I happen to be one of the kinds of people there many. There are a whole group of people. They're all considered to be bit, you know, bit neverix, who believe that quantum mechanics needs to be modified. There's a small minority of those people, which were really a minority, who think that the way in which it's modified has to be with gravity. And there isn't even a small amount of diversity of those people who think it's particularly the way that I think it is. So those are the quantum gravity folks. What's what? You see quantum gravity is already not this because when you say quantum gravity, what you really mean is quantum mechanics applied to gravitational theory. So you see, let's take this wonderful formalism of quantum mechanics and make gravity fit into it. So that is what quantum gravity is meant to be. Now I'm saying you've got to be more even handed that gravity affects the structure of quantum mechanics too. It's not just you quantize gravity. You've got to gravitate quantum mechanics and it's a two way thing. It was then when you even get started so that you're saying that we have to figure out a totally new idea. Exactly. No, it's your stock and have a theory. That's the trouble. So this is a big problem actually. Okay, we're watching here. I don't know. So we're maybe in the very early days sort of. It is in the very early days. But I just making this point. Yes. If you still have a rough sense to be, oh, Penrose says that it's got to be a reduction of the state. So let's use it. The trouble is Penrose doesn't say that Penrose says, well I think that. And then we have no, we have no experiments as yet, which showed it's that. Yes. There are experiments which are being thought through and which I'm hoping will be performed. There is an experiment which is being developed by me, Stowe who is a known for a long time, who shares this time between Liden in the Netherlands and Santa Barbara in the US. And he's been working on an experiment which could perhaps demonstrate that quantum mechanics as we now understand it. If you don't bring in the gravitational effects, it has to be modified. And then there's also experiments that are underway that kind of look at the micro-tubile side of things to see if there's in the biology. You could see something like that. Could you briefly mention it? Because that's a really sort of one of the only experimental attempts in the very early days of even thinking about us. I think there's a very serious area here which is what Stuart Hemmerff is doing and I think it's very important. One of the few places that you can really get a bit of a handle on what consciousness is is what turns it off. And when you're thinking about general anesthetics, it's very specific. These things turn consciousness off. What the hell do they do? Well Stuart and a number of people who work with him and others happen to believe that the general anesthetics directly affect micro-tubiles. And there is some evidence for this. I don't know how strong it is and how watertight the cases, but I think that it's some evidence pointing in that kind of direction. It's not just an ordinary chemical process, there's something quite different about it. And one of the main candidates is that these anesthetic gases do affect directly micro-tubiles. And how strong that evidence is, I wouldn't be in a position to say, but I think there is fairly impressive evidence. In the point is the experiments are being undertaken, which is, I mean that is experimental. It says it's a very clear direction where you can think of experiments which could indicate whether or not it's really micro-tubiles, which is the anesthetic gases directly effect. That's really exciting. One of the sad things is as far as I'm from my outside perspective, it's not many people are working on this. So there's a very, like, a Stuart, it feels like there's very few people are carrying the flag forward on this. I think it's not many in the sense it's in minority, but it's not zero anymore. You see, when Stuart and I were originally just, you know, we were just just us and a few of our friends, they weren't many people telling us, but it's grown into one of the main viewpoints. There might be about four or five or six different news that people hold and it's wonderful. So it's considered as one of the possible lines of thinking, yes. You describe physics theories as falling into one or three categories. The superb, the useful, or the tentative. I like those words. It's a beautiful categorization. Do you think we'll ever have a superb theory of intelligence and of consciousness? We might. We're a long way from it. I don't think we're even, we're in the tentative scale. I mean, it's, uh, you don't think we even entered the realm of tentative. Probably not. I think that's the race. When you see the so controversial, we don't have a clear view, which is accepted by majority. I mean, you say, yeah, people. Most views are computationally one form or another. I think it's something, but it's not very clear, because even the IIT people who think of things like this computation, but I've heard them say, no, consciousness is supposed to be not computation. I say, well, if it's not coming, it wouldn't hell is it? What's going on? What physical processes are going on, which are that? What is immune for something to be computationally then? So, is where there has to be a process, which is, it's very curious the way the history has developed in quantum mechanics, because very early on, people thought there was something to do with consciousness, but it was almost the other way around. You see, you have to say the, the Schrodinger equations says all these different alternatives happen all at once, and then when is it that only one of them happens? Well, one of the views, which was quite commonly held by a few distinguished quantum physicists, this way of conscious being looks at the system, or becomes aware of it, and at that point, it becomes one of the other. That's a row where consciousness is somehow actively reducing the state. My view is almost the exact opposite of that. It's the state reduces itself in some way, which some non-computational way, which we don't understand, we don't have a proper theory of, and that is a building block of what consciousness is. So consciousness is the other way around. It depends on that choice, which nature makes all the time when the state becomes one of the other rather than the superstition of one and the other, and when that happens, there is, well, that we're saying now, an element of proto-consciousness takes place. Protoconsciousness is roughly speaking the building block out of which actual consciousness is constructed. So you have these proto-conscious elements, which are when the state decides to won't do one thing or the other, and that's the thing which when organized together. That's the OR part in OR core, but the OR part, that's the OR part, at least when it's a conceit where when driving it as a theory, you can say it's the quantum choice of going this way or that way, but the OR part, which is the orchestration of this, is much more mysterious, and how does they brain somehow orchestrate all these individual OR processes into a genu-in-genu-in-conscious experience? And it might be something that's beautifully simple but we're completely in the dark about. Yeah, I think at the moment it's that's the thing, you know, we happily put the word ork down there to say orchestrated, but that's even more unclear what that really means. It's just like the word material orchestrated Yes, we know. And we've been dancing a little bit between the word intelligence or understanding in consciousness. Do you kind of see those sitting in the same space of mystery as we're supposed to say? Yes, we see, I tend to say you have understanding and intelligence and awareness. And somehow understanding is in the middle of it, you see? I like to say, could you say, are there an entity that is actually intelligent if it doesn't have the quality of understanding? Make sure I'm using terms I don't even know how to define with who cares. There's some really cool, there's some work poetic, so if I somehow understand them. Yes. So we don't know mathematical nature. Yes, you see, as a mathematician, I don't know how to define any of them, but at least I can point to the connections. So the idea is intelligence is something which I believe needs understanding. Otherwise you wouldn't say it's really intelligence. And understanding needs awareness. Otherwise you wouldn't really say it's understanding. Do you say of an entity that understands something? And unless it's really aware of it, you know, normal usage. So there's a three sort of awareness understanding and intelligence. And I just tend to concentrate on understanding because that's where I can say something. And that's the girl's theorem, things like that. But I wonder what does it mean to be perceived the color blue or something? I mean, I'm a foggyist. That's a much more difficult question. I mean, is it the same? If I see a color blue and you see it, if you're somebody with this condition, what's it called? Or were you assigned like a sound to a color blue? Yeah, that's not, you get colors and sounds mixed up. And that sort of thing. I mean, an interesting subject. I mean, yeah. But from the physics perspective, from the fundamental perspective, we don't. I think we're way off and having much understanding what's going on there. In your 2010 book, Cycles of Time, you suggest that another universe may have existed before the big bang. Can you describe this idea? First of all, what is the big bang? Sounds like a funny word. And what may have been there before it? Yes, just as a matter of terminology, I don't like to call it another universe. Because when you have another universe, you think of it kind of quite separate from us. But these things they're not separate. Now, the big bang conventional theory, you see, I was actually growing up in the sense that when I started getting Justin Cosmology, there was something called the steady state model, which was sort of philosophically very interesting. And there wasn't a big bang in that theory. But somehow new material was created all the time in the form of hydrogen and the universe kept on expanding, expanding, expanding, and there was room for more hydrogen. It was a rather philosophically nice picture. It was disproved when the big bang, when I said a big bang, this was theoretically discovered by people trying to solve Einstein's equations and apply it to cosmology. Einstein didn't like the idea. He liked, and I a universe which was there all the time. And he had a model which there was there all the time. But then there was this discovery, accidental discovery, very important discovery, on this microwave background. And if you there's the crackle on your television screen which is already sensing this microwave background, which is coming at us from all directions. And you can trace it back and back and back and back and it came from a very early stage of the universe. Well, it's part of the big bang theory. The big bang theory was when people tried to solve Einstein's equations. They really found you had to have this initial state. The universe, it was used to be called the primordial atom and things like this. There's Friedman and LeMetra. Friedman was a Russian and LeMetra was the Belgian and they independently were basically Friedman first. LeMetra talked about the initial state which used to be very, very concentrated. And this was state which seemed to be the origin of the universe. From a module atom. Primordial atom is what he called it. Yeah. It was a whole term. And then it became, well, friend Hoyle used to turn big bang in a kind of derogatory sense. He said, well, then just like with the shorting here in the cats. Right? Yeah, it's like sort of pick, pick, pick up on, whereas it wasn't just intentional, originally. But then the evidence piled up and piled up. And my one of my friends and I learned a lot from him. When I was in Cambridge, I was standing in a shower and he was a very proponent of steady state. And then he got converted to said, no, I'm sorry. I had a great respect for him. You went around lecturing said, I was wrong. The steady state model doesn't work. There was a big bang. And this microwave background that you see, okay, it's not actually quite the big bang. When I said not quite, it's about 380,000 years after the big bang. But that's what you see. But then you have to have had this big bang before, as in order to make the equations work. And it works beautifully. Except for one little thing, which is this thing called inflation, which people had to put into it to make it work. When I first heard of it, I didn't like it at all. What's inflation? Inflation is that in the first, I'm going to give you a very tiny number. Think of a second. That's not very long. Now, I'm going to give you a fraction of a second. One over, a number. This number has 32 digits. Between, well, let's say, between 36 and 32 digits. Tiny, tiny time between those two tiny, ridiculous seconds. Fraction of a second. The universe was supposed to have expanded in this exponential way. And in an almost way, for no pattern, parent reason, you had to invent a particular thing called the Inflation Field to make it do it. And I thought this is completely crazy. There are reasons why people stuck with this idea. You see, the thing is that I've formed my model for reasons, which you're very fundamental, if you like. It has to do this very fundamental principle, which is known as the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics says more or less, things get more and more random as time goes on. Now, another way of saying exactly the same thing is things get less and less random. As things go back, as you go back in time, they get less and less random. So you go back and back and back and back and back. And the earliest thing you can directly see is this micro way back round. What's one of the most striking features of it? Is that it's random? It has the, what you call this spectrum of, which is what's called the Planck spectrum of frequencies, different intensities for different frequencies. And this is wonderful curve, due to Max Planck, and what's to tell you is telling you that the entropy is as a maximum. Starts as often maximum, and it's going up over since. I call that the mammoth in the room. I mean, it's a paradigm. And the mammoth in the and so people quite don't cosmologists worry about this. So I worry about it. And then I thought, well, it's not really a paradox because you're looking at matter and radiation at a maximum entropy state. Once you're not seeing directly in that, it's the gravitation. It's gravitation, which is not thermalized. The gravitation was very, very low entropy. And it's low entropy by the uniformity. And you see that in the microwave, too. It's very uniform over the host guy. I'm compressing a long story into a very short two-cent. And doing a great job, yeah. So what I'm saying is that there's a huge puzzle. Why was gravity in this very low entropy state, very high, organized state, everything else was all random? And that to me, there's a biggest problem in cosmology. The biggest problem? Nobody thinks he worry about it. People say they solved all the problems, and they don't even worry about it. They think inflation sources. It doesn't. It can't. Because it's just, it's just, it's just a clever, that that was your problem with the inflation describing some aspect of the influence right after the big bang. Inflation was supposed to stretch it out and make it all uniform, you see. It doesn't do it because you can only do it if it's uniform already at the beginning. It's, you just have to look, I can't go into the details, but it doesn't solve it. And it was completely clear that it doesn't solve it. But where does the conformal cyclic cosmology of, yeah, we're starting to talk about something before, yes, that singular. Well, I began, I was just thinking of myself, how boring this universe is going to be. You've got this exponential expansion. This was discovered early in the, in this century, twenty-first century. People discovered that these supernova exploding stars showed that the universe is actually undergoing this exponential expansion. So it's a soft, similar expansion. And it seems to be a feature of this term that Einstein introduced into his cosmology for the wrong reason. He wanted a universe that was static. He put this new term into his cosmology to make it make sense. It's called the cosmological constant. And then when he got convinced that the universe had a big bang, he retracted it, complaining that this was his greatest problem. The trouble was it wasn't a blender. It was actually right. I run it. And so the universe seems to be behaving with this cosmological constant. Okay, so this universe is expanding and expanding, what's going to happen in the future? Well, he gets more and more boring for a while. What's the most interesting thing in the universe? Well, this black holes. The black holes more or less gulp down in tower clusters of galaxies. The class, it'll swallow up most of our galaxy. We will run into our en-drama the galaxies black hole. That black hole will swallow out one. They'll get bigger and bigger and they'll basically swallow out the whole cluster of galaxies. Gulp it all down. Pretty well all. Most of it. Maybe not all. Most of it. That'll happen to it. There'll be just these black holes around. Pretty boring. But still, not as boring as it's going to get. It's going to get more boring because these black holes, you wait, wait, and you wait, and wait, and I'm not even willing for time. And Hawking's black hole of aberration starts to come in. And the black holes, you just, it's a clever tedious. Finally, evaporate away. Each one goes away, disappears with a pop at the end. What could be more boring? That, it was boring then. Now, this is really boring. There's nothing, not even black holes. The universe gets colder and colder and colder and colder and ever. This is very, very boring. Now, there's not science, is it? But it's emotional. So I thought, who's going to be bored by this universe? Not us. We won't be around. It'll be mostly photons running around. And what the photons do, they don't get bored because it's part of relativity, you see. It's not really that they don't experience anything. That's not the point. The photons get right out to infinity without experience any time. That's the way the way relativity works. And this was part of what I used to do in my old days when I was looking gravitational radiation and how things behaved in infinity, infinity is just like another place. You can squash it down as long as you don't have any mass in the world. Infinity is just another place. The photons get there. The gravitons get there. What do they get? They've run into infinity. They say, well, now I'm here. What do I? There's something on the other side? Is there the usual view? It's just a mathematical notion. There's nothing on the other side. That's just the boundary of it. A nice example is this beautiful series of pictures by the Dutch artist, MC Escher. You may know them. The ones called Circle in it's very famous one with the angels and the devils. And you can see them crowding and crowding up to the edge. Now, the kind of geometry that these angels and devils inhabit, that stare infinity. But from our perspective, infinity is just a car. It's a place. Okay, there. It's a... Is there a can you just take a brief pause? Yes. And just the word you're saying infinity is just a place. So for the most part, infinity, sort of even just going back to infinity is a mathematical concept. I think this is one of the things that are actual physical metaphors. In which way does infinity ever manifest itself in our physical universe? Well, it does in various places. You see, it's a thing that, if you're not a mathematician, you think, oh, I'm a finisher, I can't think about that. Mathematicians think about infinity all the time. They get used to the idea and they just play around with different kinds of infinities and it becomes no problem. But yeah, you just have to take my word for it. Now, one of the things is you see, you take a you-close the enjormetry. Well, it just keeps on geeks, on geeks, on going and it goes out to infinity. Now, there's other kinds of geometry and this is a what's called hyperbolic geometry. It's a bit like you clearly the enjormetry is a little bit different. It's like what Azure was trying to describe in his angels and devils. And he learned about this from coxeter. And he think that very nice thing. I try to represent this infinity to this kind of geometry. So it's not quite you clearly enjormetry is a bit like it that the angels and the devils inhabit. And there infinity, by this nice transformation, you squash the air infinity down so you can draw it as this nice circle boundary to their universe. Now, from our outside perspective, we can see their infinity as the boundary. Now, what I'm saying is that it's very like that. The infinity that we, might experience like those angels and devils in their world, can be thought of as a boundary. Now, I found this a very useful way of talking about radiation gravitational radiation and things like that. It was a trick, mathematical trick. So, now what I'm saying is that that mathematical trick becomes real. That somehow the photons they need to go somewhere because for there, from their perspective, infinity is just another place. Now, this is a difficult idea to get your mind around. So that's why I caused one of the reasons because most just the finding of the other trouble taking me seriously. But to me, it's not necessarily a wild idea. What's on the other side of that infinity? You have to think, why am I allowed to think of this? Because photons don't have any mass. And we in physics have beautiful ways of measuring time. They're incredibly precise clocks. Atomic and nuclear clocks unbelievably precise. Why are they so precise? Because of the two most famous equations of 20th century physics. One of them is Einstein's E equals MC squared. What's that tell us? Energy and mass are equivalent. The other one is even older than that. So 20th century, only just, max plank E equals H new. New is a frequency. H is a constant again like C. E is energy. Energy and frequency are equivalent. Put the two together. Energy and mass are equivalent Einstein. Energy and frequency are equivalent. Max plank put the two together. Mass and frequency are equivalent. Absolutely basic physical principle. If you have a massive entity, a massive particle it is a clock with a very, very precise frequency. It's not you can't directly use it. You have to scale it down so your atomic and nuclear clocks, but that's the basic principle. You scale it down to some that you can actually perceive. But it's the same principle. If you have mass, you have beautiful clocks. But the other side of that coin is, if you don't have mass, you don't have clocks. If you don't have clocks, you don't have rulers. You don't have scale. So you don't have space in time. You don't have a measure of the scale of space. Oh, scale of space. You have space. If you do have the structure that was called the conformal structure, you see it's what the angels levels have. If you look at the eye of the devil, no matter how close to the boundary it has the same shape. But it has a different size. So you can scale up and you can scale down, but you mustn't change the shape. So it's basically the same idea, but applied to space time. In the very remote future, you have things which don't measure the scale, but the shape if you like is still there. Now that's in the remote future. Now I'm going to do the exact opposite. Now I'm going to go away back into the big bang. Now as you get there, things go hotter and hotter, denser and denser, what's the universe dominated by? Particles moving around almost with the speed of light. When they get almost with the speed of light, okay, they begin to lose the mass too. They're for completely opposite reason. They lose the sense of scale as well. So my crazy idea is the big bang and the remote future, they seem completely different. One is extremely dense, extremely hot. The others very, very rare if I'm in very, very cold. But if you squash one down by this conformist scale and you get the other. So although they look and feel very different, they're really almost the same. The remote future on the other side and in claiming as that, one of the photons go, they go into the next big bang. You've got to get your mind around that crazy step on the other side of the place that isn't funny. Okay. So I'm saying the other side of our big bang. Now I'm going back into the big bang. Back back back. There was the remote future of a previous Eon. Previously on. And what I'm saying is that previous Eon, there are signals coming through to us, which we can see and which we do see. And these are both signals. The two main signals are to do with black holes. One of them is the collisions between black holes and as they spiral into each other, they release a lot of energy in the form of gravitational waves. Those gravitational waves get through in a certain form into the next Eon. That's fascinating that there is some, I mean, maybe I'm maybe can correct me from wrong. But that means that some information can travel from another Eon. Exactly. That is fascinating. I mean, I've seen some where described the discussion of the Fermi paradox, you know, that if there's intelligent life, yes, communication immediately takes you there. So, my colleague Vahegoza-Jan, who I work with on this idea for a while, we have a crazy paper on that. Yes. So, look at the family paradox. Yes. Right. So, so if the universe is just cycling over and over and over, punctuated by the punctuated, the singularity, the big bang. Yes. And then intelligent or any kind of intelligent systems can communicate through from Eon to Eon. Why haven't we heard anything from our friends? Because we don't know how to look. That's fundamentally the reason. As we, I don't know, you see, it's speculation. I mean, the setty program, there's a reason and more thing to do, but still speculation. It's trying to say, okay, maybe not too far away with a civilization which got their first, before us, early enough that they could send our signals, but how far away would you need to go before? I mean, I don't know. We have so little knowledge about that. We haven't seen any signals yet, but it's worth looking. It's worth looking. And what I'm trying to say, here's another possible place where you might look. Now you're not looking at civilizations which got their first. You're looking at those civilizations which were so successful, probably. A lot more success on their, we're likely to be, but it looks and things. Which knew how to handle their own global warming or whatever it is until get through it all and to live to a ripe old age in the sense of a civilization, to the extent that they could harness signals that they could propagate through for some reason of their own desires, whatever we would know, to to other civilizations which might be able to pick up the signals. But what kind of signals would they be? I haven't been focused. Let me ask the question. Yes. What to use the most beautiful idea in physics or mathematics or the art at the intersection of the two? I'm going to have to say complex analysis. I might have said infinities and one of the most single, beautiful idea I think was the fact that you can have infinities of different sizes and so on. But that's in a way I think complex analysis. This goes, it's got so much magic in it. It's a very simple idea. You take these, you go, so if you take numbers, you take the integers and then you fill them up into the fractions and the real numbers, you imagine you're trying to measure a continuous line and then you think of how you can solve equations and what about x squared equals minus 1? Well there's no real number which has to satisfy that. So you have to think of, well there's a number called i. You think you invent it? Well in a certain sense it's there already. But this number, when you add that square root of minus 1 to it, you have what's called the complex numbers and they're an incredible system. If you like, you put one little thing in, you put square root of minus 1 in and you get how much benefit other it's all sorts of things that you never imagined before and it's that amazing, all hiding there and putting that square root of minus 1 in. So in a sense that's the most magical thing I've seen in mathematics or physics and it's in quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics. You see it's there already. You might think what's it doing there? Okay just a nice beetle piece of mathematics and then suddenly we see, nope, it's the very crucial basis of quantum mechanics. So on the way the world works. So on the question of whether math is discovered or invented, it sounds like you may be suggesting that partially it's possible that math isn't indeed discovered. Oh absolutely. Yes. No it's more like archaeology than you might think. Yes. So let me ask the most ridiculous, maybe the most important question. What is the meaning of life? What gives your life a filament purpose, happiness, and meaning? What do you think we're here on this? Given all the big bang and the infinity is the photons that we've talked about. Well I would say, I think it's not a stupid question. I mean there are some people you know, many of my colleagues are scientists and they say, well that's a stupid question, meaning it well we just hear because things came together and produced life and so on. I think there's more to it. But what there is that's more to it. Really much idea. And it might be somehow connected to the mechanisms of consciousness that we were talking about, the mystery there. Yeah. It's connected with also, yeah I think these things are tied up in ways which you see I tend to think the mystery of consciousness is tied up with the mystery of quantum mechanics and how it hits in with the classical world and that's all to do with the mystery of quantum complex numbers. And there are mysteries there which are, look like mathematical mysteries but they seem to have a bearing on the way the physical world operates. We're scratching the surface. We're at a long huge way to go before we really understand that. And it's a beautiful idea that the depth, the mathematical depth could be discovered and then there's tragedies of ghettos and completeness along the way that will have to somehow figure our ways around.

And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom that Roger Penrose wrote in his book The Emperors New Mind. I beneath all this technicality is the feeling that it is indeed quote unquote obvious that the conscious mind cannot work like a computer. Even though much of what is involved in mental activity might do so, this is the kind of obviousness that a child can see. Though the child may later in life become brow beaten into believing that the obvious problems are quote unquote non-problems. To be argued into non-existence by careful reasoning and clever choices of definition. Children sometimes see things clearly that are obscured in later life. We often forget the wonder that we felt as children when the cares of the quote unquote real world have begun to settle on our shoulders. Children are not afraid to post basic questions that may embarrass us as adults to ask. What happens to each of our streams of consciousness after we die? Where was it before we were born? Might we become or have been someone else? Why do we perceive it all? Why are we here? Why is there a universe here at all in which we can actually be? These are puzzles that tend to come with the awakenings of awareness in any of us. And no doubt with the awakening of self-awareness within whichever creature or other entity it first came. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
