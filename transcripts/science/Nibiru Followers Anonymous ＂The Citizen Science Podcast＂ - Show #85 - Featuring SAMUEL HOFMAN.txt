 Huh, hey Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah as you're watching the Citizen Science Podcast, the one and only Twin Solar System podcast featuring Samuel Hoffman along with his team of experts as they discuss the very latest information about our binary twin solar system. Welcome. Okay. Hello, hello everybody and welcome to the Citizen Science Podcast and you know we're live if we're having technical issues, but I'm happy you all are here and let's go ahead and get the show started. Anyway, so we have the one and only Samuel Hoffman, of course, here with us. Let's go ahead and add him on so we can talk about this twin solar system. You know, there's other planets that are passing just really close by Earth, right? As we speak right now, so we're going to be seeing lots and lots of pictures of them as we go through the show today. So let's go here. Hey, Sam, how are you today? Hello. Parable. I don't know why the music stops. It goes totally quiet. That's the second week that's happened and it throws me off. And Taylor gets it off and goes welcome instead of welcome to the show. It's just like normal. Normal. Anyway, we have to We have to. It's live. I just panic and then I forget what I'm going to say and then I what I do say makes no sense. But we're here. It doesn't matter. So so let's turn the music down. Now that is playing. Let's turn it down a notch. Boy, how's Montana? It is crispy and 53 degrees sunshine with mostly clouds here and there. Yesterday it was really cloudy and cold. It's been very cold at night lately. We have been below freezing. It was 27 degrees and 29 degrees last couple of nights. Frost on all the grounds, snow in the mountains. That's chilly. Yeah. Yeah. Burr. Okay. Yeah. The leaves are all pretty much falling off the trees and yeah. Yeah, it's fall and you know, the kids will have a bunch of leaves to walk through on Halloween night, which is only five days away. It's supposed to be 70 degrees Halloween night in Oklahoma. 70. Yeah. 75. Yeah. A big rewarmup hot pressure system went through this week. Do you remember? I know you have to bring the other guys out, but do you remember last week's show we were talking right at the beginning of where I was doing the weather and we were talking to the people that were in New Mexico. And I hope those folks were that may have been listening because they immediately got bombarded with a very, very serious blood scenario as we were on the show last week. So, I knew it was coming, but I didn't know it was immediately while we were doing the show. Canada. Somewhere in Canada, you know, got bombarded with a flood at the same time frame also. So, that stood out. I got in trouble again for our flood video. I didn't tell you about that. You know, I just don't want to, if you're going to play those videos, don't run the sound. Talk over it yourself from the information that you gathered from the video. Yeah, don't play the sound. I think that's where you're getting it. So. Okay. I'll try that. I'm just like. Try that. That's why I stopped. I stopped. Natural disaster. I stopped. I don't know. It's strange. Flood videos and stuff like that because I was getting in trouble for them and never give out death counts or say a couple of key words these days. We're having to change our key words. We have it. We never used to have to worry about what you're saying now, but now we have to be very careful. And, you know, I have, like speaking of strange, I'm not even, there's nobody even on my personal page anymore commenting or liking. It's literally like I don't get out to anyone anymore. And I post a bunch of stuff on my personal page and, granted, only my friends can see it, but, you know, I have well over 5,000 plus friends and nobody's commenting. And then, of course, I looked at, you know, last week's show and the YouTube and we had a bunch of, we had six comments down that and the view count is higher than it was the week before. You know. We should have way more people at least, you know, because you're scrolling through YouTube and, you know, I mean, there's how many people on YouTube at any given time. You know, we should definitely have more people popping in and popping out. I did see yesterday one of your shorts actually came across the YouTube short playlist on Smart TV. So that was a good thing. Really? We were actually. Okay. You got promoted. Honestly, I got some views. Okay. Speaking of which, I did in Christopher's video around a whole bunch of sites today because he had such a short view count. And so I sent it to about 20 different sites today so we can up his view count. But anyway, I'm sure you have to bring your guys in and here we are gossiping and they're in the green room. Hey, are you guys eating the Doritos and all the green M&Ms and all the green room? Speaking, which one would go get a couple? I see Julian and she looks like she's ready. She looks like she's ready. She has a big smile on her face. Okay, Sam. Let's go ahead and get Julian in here and we can see how things are going in Scotland. So hey, there she is. Julian Watson, everybody. I'll give you a applause. How are you today, Julian? I'm fine. I'm trying to keep puppy dogs off my lap because I brought my Halloween tub in with me because it's got my sweeties in. You know, my show sweeties. Oh, good. The babies. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You're all set. For all of us, they've just eaten all their sweeties already. The only thing they've got left is their doggy chop. A couple of piglets. That's how it is in Scotland. Well, it's been raining, raining, raining. It was seven degrees Celsius and it was raining. In the morning, it was entirely different. But by the time I got out of work, as I opened the door to go out, you know, that's when you see, oh, I know what's happening. My weather app was right. It says rain by three o'clock. And what do you know? Sure enough. There it is. Sure enough. And what did I forget at home today? My waterproof trousers. What a genius. Uh-oh. Okay. Right. Well, I don't know what to think. You had to be out riding your bike in the rain. That would just be not fun. I mean, you know. No. No. Well, I hope it stays clear for you on your journey to and from work. Well, thank you. Well, I'm not working for the next two days. Oh, well, we can talk about that too. Yes. Good news. Well, let's go ahead and get Christopher in here. I see he's sitting there all by himself in the green room and it looks sad. So let's go ahead and get Christopher in here with this guy. He's quite lonely. He has eaten. No, I know. I know. He'll be eating all these chocolates and these scissors and stuff. I know. Save us some munchies. Okay. Hey, there he is, Christopher. Hey, everybody. How are you guys doing? How are you guys doing? Let's make it. Let's make it. It's good. It's still warm. It's like, I think it's set at 85 degrees, but it feels a lot hotter than that. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I just walked across the street before the show and like, you know, I'm just like all hot and sweat. Hot. My forehead's sweating. It's still really hot here. So, you know. Right. I have to go and let these two dogs out or else I'll get moky. Yeah, I was going to say yesterday, you know, it's nice. It's like in the 70s here and I stepped out back to take pictures and the sun was so hot. I mean, my skin, you know how it is. It starts stinging and I'm like, this is not comfortable. I stood there and I was thinking, I had a feeling of dread. Like if it just gets unbearably hot, I'm going to be miserable. I was like, that's what I thought to myself because it's already 70 degrees and my skin is burning. Right. It's weird. It's not. It's not. Not liking that. Well, that would be that extra star that is not being seen by most of the population here. And if you know, I mean, we're feeling it. The animals know it's there. The plant snow, it's there. Those winter overplants that we've never seen before here in Montana, where, you know, you can have a garden that actually turns to seed and is still living sticking out of the snow. I've never seen that in Montana before, but we have seen it up here for quite a few years now. And then you know that if you, you know, if you have window tinting on your car and you roll down your window and you're driving down the road and that sun's coming in on your left arm and within about 10 seconds, your arm is on fire like it never used to be. It used to be that. That took a half hour when I was a kid. Right. That took a half hour before you even got warm from the sun. And people don't realize that we have a big, huge red mall. Oh, God, I've watched a bunch of climate, uh, climatological videos this last week. Oh my God. It, you know, and they're talking about CO2 sequestration and then what we have to do and how we have to adjust our living and all this blah, blah, blah. And I'm going to, meanwhile, I'm just standing there shaking my head going, yep, you're not taking into a big ass thing that came up. From below. That's why we're hot. That's why it burns. You know, that's why we get instant suntans now and all of that. Right. Anyway, and it's, you know, it's not the size of your sun. It's way bigger, way bigger star than we've ever had throughout my lifetime. So that, that should, you know, maybe account for something. I took a video the other day, either evening, a sunset, and the sun was so big. I'll show you all the clip in a minute, but, um, yeah, it was noticeably huge and flaring as I, you know, moved the camera around, the sun would bulge out and do crazy stuff. So it was very noticeable. And one other thing, I don't know, the last couple of shows you've heard me complain about not having any good picture days, no clouds, though, um, that has still remained the same. We're going on about a month, Sam. I check, I check all the time. I keep looking at, because as soon as it's great, I'm going to go live. I want to go live and I want to have something to talk about. But what's going on? Everybody's getting pictures of clouds, but nothing here. We are very white out going on again. Not me. I had blank out. Oh, okay. Yeah, nothing. Well, yeah, I, I, I drove yesterday and I hardly saw anything in the sky either. Yes. I saw the asteroids. I saw a couple of, you know, tiny little star destroyers up there, but for the most part, I really didn't see a lot of planets. I saw a little bit of, uh, Saturn's, uh, Yellow Moon, Ion Tail, you know, going from the right hand side of the sun to, and it was in the south at the time, because it was, the sun was in the southeastern slash south sky, and which it shouldn't be. It's supposed to be overhead at noon-ish and one o'clock and two o'clock, but no, it's in the south sky. Don't worry about that. That's just normal. Not, uh, you know, and it just, it blows me way of all the things that are happening right now and nobody notices or puts these together. And they're so anti-normal in everything that I ever grew up with. And I'll just, you know, tell everybody again, go watch an old Western that was filmed in the 70s. Look at the size of the sun. Look at the clouds in the sky. You, it's nothing in comparison to how, what we have going on above our heads right now. And, and we, we started talking about this in the go, uh, Jillian, okay, she's playing with the ducks. Okay. Just checking, I wasn't going on too long, but anyway, um, we talked about, uh, Christopher's videos earlier and he, we'll show those here in a little while, but, uh, I want to commend you for the, your, your, the series photographs that you put in this last video. Excellent job. I'm realizing I'm going, and then it moved, and then it moved, and then it moved, and I'm wow, he's doing it. Thanks. Great job. I mean, I, I got goosebumps during those videos. I got goosebumps. And when you give me goosebumps, you're doing good. Right? Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. I thought that was important, you know, to show just how, um, you know, how quickly after you make a drawing, these photos start coming in that match. It's incredible. Is it like that? Oh, let's just look at that. This is incredible. I mean, you got to, you take a first glance and you're like, yeah, but then you really got to stop and look back and forth, make the comparisons and even look at the shape of all the streaks about the trees there and look at Sam's drawing. And it's like the drawing was released a few hours before this photo was submitted and it was taken yesterday in Idaho. So, and also I want to point out, uh, immediately when I saw this drawing, I thought to myself about how orange I sat him was. And I'm like, I saw in the drawing he had put yellow and whatnot into I sat him. That stood out, you know, because I said, I'm red. And anyway, within a few hours, this picture, I was scrolling and I'm like, oh my God, it's orange, just like the drawing. Anyway, I had that one of those moments, but it's perfect. And then here's another example. Let's see. Yes. And it not orange, but still you can perfectly see the lead asteroid. You can see that darker blue rounded shape. Yeah, it lined up perfect to. And you get lines up perfectly. You don't have to make any adjustments. All you have to do is overlay Sam's picture and it fits exactly. You don't have to resize it or crop it down to make it fit. It fits perfect. It's just incredible. And I will point out again that I don't copy this off the computer and I sit down in the living room at the living room table and next to my window, which has a north facing view. And I don't copy out of the sky either. I just sit down and with my dinner plate and my I've got this plastic peanut butter top and a bowl. And that's what I draw the round shapes with and I move them around in front of me on the paper until it fits what my brain is telling. Well, this is where it is. This is what I see. And this is what I think. And then I draw it in and it's completely pre-hand. It's out of my head. I don't copy anything. And that's where it gives me goosebumps because it is so unbelievably accurate. And I go, wow, I did it again. And you know, and it's amazing because this is what I see in my head. And so I draw it, you know, is perfect again. Again, it's like, you know, and we've been watching it, you know, at least I've been watching it now for it's been a year, but I think I've been able to visually see it for myself for eight months now. And just, you know, we're watching it month after month. So we can kind of tell exactly what is in the sky. And then Sam draws these drawings and they fit perfectly. It's amazing. Oh, I thank you, Main. I just took now because I didn't think I was going to see anything. It's just been gray like the whole day. And when I looked at it because I was waiting for the Amazon man, the, I looked at it and I seen it. It looked like on the horizon, but over to, I'm not even sure what that is anymore, because I'm sure we tipped again. We're like sort of twisted round like the sun's coming out even further behind the trees now. But I mean, I don't know how rapidly this kind of thing happens because we're moving into our one orbit. Yeah, this is my first time actually watching it because last year I wasn't well when I came here. But this year I can actually look at everything and it's just amazing. And I thank you the pictures, Rebecca. I don't know if you found them. They're glorious purple and purple and pink streaks and them. But they had orange. I heard you guys talking about orange now. The base of Saru has moved far closer within the last couple of weeks too. I'm sure it was Saru. I'm sorry to cut in, but I mean, apologies. One of the dogs hurt himself and if we were out now, so took me a wee bit. But I did hear you say something to do with me, but yeah. Saru is moving in more quickly on the horizon to the mid-left of just left of the sun. And it got bigger even in the last week. And I saw a couple of shots earlier for the last couple of days where we're going, wow, that's big, wow, that's big, wow, that's big. Yeah, they're going over the top of us and the opacity is getting smaller. And Attu and Attu's mood are getting smaller. And we're actually starting to see actual spatials of Attu. Now, generically, and we were talking about this prior to the show, generically, we're seeing Attu's mood is in front of Attu predominantly. But we are now starting to see the underneath and the bottoms of Attu as well, which is also in your videos, Christopher. Okay. Yeah, because I'm sure I've seen ridges of something. It was really incredible. And Nicole got a couple of good captures today as well, showing the same thing. And of course, this is people around the world capturing the same thing, because that's what's above us and that's what's real. And these aren't just clouds. These are planetary objects with clouds, their own atmospheres around them. And they continue you will leave continuously, but then you will leave. I always hate that they appear the same. Now, here's another example of a Saturn, Shellamoon in front of a Saturn. Although, yeah, and lead object, which is darker dead center. On the top. Yeah, you can see it. Look at its noise. Oh man. Flame like base clouds and the flame like micro clouding and the orange. I was going to say mainly I pulled this up because you were talking about Saru. And I just, you know, the light blue at the very bottom, you said with Saru. On the left hand side, right, on the left hand side behind that track, you see that circular rounded cloud that is light baby blue just above the horizon on the left. That's the open core bottom of Saru. Wow. And that thicker one line of clouds just above the light blue is the base ring of Saru. And it's very thick and there's one of them. Where nepecity has three rings. Saru has one very thick lower base ring. So the blue immediately above that base ring is the green blue of planet Saru. Which is on the left hand side of the sun. With an axis tip, Hattu's axis tip is getting greater now. And then Yuri is getting sort of pushed out of the way and up and big. And I mean, sort of there at dawn and then does the big final reveal at the end of the day at sunset, you can finally really see Yuri better. And it's weird how all of that rotates around us along with our sun. And strange. Hey, I see Hector Lopez is here. Hector, I got your letter. Thank you. It only took two and a half almost three months. Thank you very much. I mailed you one back. I hope you get it. What a relief. Yeah, I was concerned. I was concerned for him too. You know, and it's like, you know, it's important to me. I really appreciate your donation. Thank you. It was perfect timing as always is. You know, of course, everybody knows out there we're all broke right now, me included especially. And they they, I'm going to say they raised my damn internet bill, $9.40 last month. And then next month and then the next month and then it just keeps going up and up. And I'm paying $175 a month for internet now. Oh, wow. Yeah. That's a lot. That's a lot. It barely works. I mean, if higher speed wireless download, yeah, but upload speeds just absolutely sucks. And the only thing worse than that, unfortunately, is that I find out that Starlink is even worse on upload speed. Yeah, I've been hearing a lot of people talk about that, how it's just, you know, it shuts off at random times and they just got to deal with it, I guess. Well, there's a lot of political going on around the uplinks to Starlink right now. We mean, we might see a very serious argument over said services because some people who are involved in that are getting themselves into trouble on the political and economic commonplace of the market. And anyway, I'll leave it at that. I don't want to go into too much detail, but Elon Musk is making some mistakes. But anyway, Yeah, well, I know that I've mentioned it probably through my ass over it and it is merely my opinion. So, and I'm entitled to my free speech opinion of what I see happening on the public news service. Thank you. Anyway, okay, right, right. Talk places or anything because I am not a stock broker and I cannot give up on that advice. Cover that one. And no hamsters were injured in the making of this video. Let's see who all is here. Let's see who's here because I see several actually. So I don't want to get back to the top here and oh boy, look who's here. It's Nicole first in line. That's pretty well since she's been first in line. I think Nicole, hello from she's in Colorado. So good to see you. This is your friendly reminder that ET never left always been here. She knows. She knows. All right. Good to see you, Nicole. And by the way, I like that you did it too. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll play that too here in a short minute. That's fun wasn't it? Yeah, that's right. David is here. Great. Hi, David. Hi, David. Good to see you. Good to see you. I like your little emojis. Those are cute. Oh boy, screaming thin man is here. I love that name. I wonder if he's thin. I don't know. I'm curious. He got some of your picture. No, hi to see. Good to see you. And Sabrina. Good to see you too, Sabrina. It's been a minute. Nice. Okay. Good to see you here. Oh, and here's Susie. Hi Susie. And Slovenia. Nice to see you too, Susie. Always is. And here's Miss Tara. Tara Nelson. Hello. Good to see you. She came in second place recently on some contest. I didn't really catch all the details, but that's pretty. I mean, second place is really, you know, I'm impressed. So good to see you, Tara. Congratulations. And here is Brendan. He's in Ireland. I know that much. Hi, Brendan. Nice to see you. Oh, good. Experimental is here. I always can count on her being here on time. She was here two minutes early, everybody. Good to see you, experimental. And what did I tell you? T-Racy, they always travel together. T-Racy and experiment. They're like a pack. I know. But can't tell me that's not planned. Hi, T-Racy. You're right. That's cute. You guys calling each other? You're gonna tell them no, you're gonna comment? Right. Are they roommates or what? That's cute. Audrey is here in South Africa, and it's 10 p.m. and 34 degrees Celsius. Hi, Audrey. Good to have you. And here is our good friend, Michelle. Good to see you, Michelle in Indiana. Yeah. And we'll have to get her back on here soon. Yeah. I don't know what her plans are, but I miss talking to her, so we gotta arrange that. Okay. And experimental said hi, just to me. Hi, experimental. Oh, good. Maria is here. She's in Alaska. Yeah. And she's such a nice lady, too. She really is. Like, she's just a nice person. I like her, so good to see you, Maria. And hi, Ninja. Peace be with you, too. I like your messages. They're always so sweet and positive. I like that. But awesome to see you. And Karen is here. Hi, Karen. Good to have you. Freesie's here. Yay. I was hoping I'd see Freesie in the list. She is here. Good to see you, Freesie. Freesie Peach. I wonder what the story is behind that. Everybody's got a name, you know, a story behind why they chose whatever. I'm just curious. Yeah. Hey, Robert. He's here in New Zealand. Hi, Robert. Hey, how you doing? Yeah. I always look forward. And I like seeing his pictures. There's something special about Robert's pictures. I know Sam agrees with that, so that's cool. Let's see here. Let's keep scrolling. I think, oh, and here we got Hector. Hector is here, which I already knew that. But good to see you, Hector. Oh, good. Dennis is here. And he was apologizing for being like 24 minutes. Uh-oh. Well, I'll let you slide. I'll let you slide. Good to see you, Dennis. Oh, and Josie's here. Uh-oh. Wait, not that. Didn't click right. Hey, there she is. Hi, Josie. Good to see you. And we're all caught up. And Robert's giving us high fives times three. So, but hello, everybody. I'm glad you all are here. So, uh, let me, I'll show you all real quick what I'm talking about as far as a, like, sky. Here's my little TikTok from a couple of days ago. This is about 6.30 in the evening. And this is what the sky has been looking like. I'm not kidding, but I take morning pictures and evening pictures, and it's, there's nothing to see. Uh-oh. Wait, let me try to play it again. But I still know they're there. You know what I mean? I, like, it doesn't matter whether the sky is blank or clear. It doesn't matter. Yeah. Well, it's not letting me play it. I'll get to that. I'll play it in a second. Bummer. It keeps, well, I probably am going to have to back out and come back in. That happens regularly. Yeah, you get to fall once when you're talking just a moment ago. Yeah. This is, after every show, I send stream yard a message with my list of, you know, issues. So, I, I don't know. It's, anyway. I had no, I had no notice this morning when I woke up at all. So. I'll be right. That makes you wonder if the whole world has gone down and or, or is it just you Right. I know a few weeks ago Verizon had a total shutdown of their service for several hours and I'm like, did I pay the phone bill? I didn't know what happened. So. Oh, we went the other night without power in the middle of the night and I woke up and the house was really cold and there was no lights on anywhere and, you know, no clocks or anything like that because we have digital clocks and I don't even put batteries in the old-fashioned ticker ones anymore and I need to because now I have to go online every and I have to wait for the online to come back on to reset the clocks and that takes about 10 minutes. But yeah, we had no internet, no electrical and we, and that was one of the nights. It was 27 degrees outside. Yeah. And you're sitting there, you know, I got five handles burning in the living room so I can stay warm. Standing with your hands out going, okay, electricity you can turn back on anytime now. And we had a pretty heavy windstorm the other night and that was that brief thing that went through Montana and then up into Canada. But then that was part of the warm-up and that cut-off low that went through and over the top of Colorado the other day and then over the top of you guys, Rebecca, and then since left the country and is headed toward the UK. Oh, happy days. Yeah, well these storms are going across the Atlantic now from one continent to the other and they're, you know, they're existing and you guys got in the UK, they got hit with what was left of Hurricane Kirk and that, you know, that went into Spain and the UK and Ireland and everybody and that's when you guys, London actually got flooded from that and how quickly we forget all of these huge disasters that are happening week after week after week. And like four days later, nobody even remembers them. Terrible. It's like, why, you know, these guys are going to be repairing this damage for the next 10 years and, you know, society has already forgotten four days later. It's like spooky. You know, let's not forget what you stopped in Florida and North Carolina, you know, in Asheville. And now because they're in the valley and that side of North Carolina never gets hit with tropical storms or hurricanes and they got, they got the straight line flooding in there and that went all in those little tight little valleys and basically Asheville is gone. And I'm sure there's a whole bunch of them gone. Yeah, there's, you know, and there's still another body count and I hope I don't get blank for this, but it's over 240 people and still 90 people missing. And that was the last I heard. I mean, that could be inaccurate by today's count. But they're over 240 people. It's not important anymore of that stuff. So we don't know what's going on, really. Yeah, it's amazing how past it is. Yeah, the people that live there have a different story than what the people. Yeah, I've heard a lot from people on TikTok and you see these videos and they're given to you on your feeds and these people are all there. They're there. They know what's going on. That's so sad. I mean, right. I'm annoyed because the media is so... It's not even coming yet. It's not even coming. Northern Africa, they flooded last week, the week before France flooded a couple of days before that because it was the same storm. You know, look what's going on in Africa, Northern Africa, which is hilarious. They're actually getting rain and the desert is turning green and it's happening quickly. I think you can actually see that from up high, can't you? You're getting satellite footage of the the Sahara Desert is now turning green. And it's not just small areas. It's huge swaths. I mean, they've seen on satellite that has to be a biggest area that's no green. All of Northern Africa is changing and it's getting greener. And now remember all the flooding in the desert in Saudi Arabia and Yemen and all of those guys are all soaked and they've got, you know, 20 years worth of rain this year and last year. And so all of that's going to change. Wow. I've seen videos from Greece on the Fourth of October. These mad purple storms with lightning and that was just when bonkers and pouring. Right. And it was sideways storms. And we've already forgotten about the typhoon that went through Taiwan and North Korea and Vietnam. And that was a week ago. No, there's something else coming, isn't there? 240 kilometer per hour winds sideways. You couldn't even see across the street. Now we had that here in Montana as well a couple of years ago. We had 70 and 80 mile an hour winds that went through and you couldn't see across the street. And it tore all the trees down everywhere. And then we had that storm here a couple of months ago through Lolo and that hit Missoula and Missoula County. And those were the top peak gusts. I think it was 95 miles an hour up on one of the mountains. Wow. And I mean local mountains, not a big mountain, a local smaller mountain. And the outside the valley of Missoula or one of the mountains at the edge valley of Missoula at 95 mile an hour gust. And of course the downtown area, the university district just got wiped out from all the older trees that have been in the city for, you know, 40, 50 years. And those things just got just trashed. So this is happening all over the world. And I don't think people are sharing that. Off the road. And I think they're just, you know, calling it an isolated, isolated incident. And it's not, we are watching drastic dire extreme climate change go off right before our very eyes. I have a question. And you know how we were supposed to have storm Ashley during the week? Right. Yeah. So here's the thing about three days before the storm. Hits. They kept sending me CIPA alerts. Now that's the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency because I linked up with that when I started cycling further to go to work. And I always thought, well, you've got to know what you're facing like winds, rain, sleet, whatever. Because I've never been in ice and all these things before. But I mean, um, yeah, they filled us full of it the whole week. Just about. And then the storm hit and we're still waiting for the storm to hit. And that was the storm. And when I looked at my weather app, we're sitting in a like a shape like this. And this shape just kind of goes like that and it changes. But we're always inside this shape. So we actually didn't really get much of anything. Well, you were in the wind. Wow. Yeah. So we were just. Yeah. So we were in somewhere between 35 to 55 miles and over winds. And in South Africa, they had a saying like, oh, if your dustbin isn't in the next street, then it wasn't a storm. You know, it wasn't the southeast. So I thought, well, right, I've still got off of how many bins. And we've got six of them, seven, eight. Yeah. I've still got them all. So, you know, that's right. That's a good count. I didn't even lose a dog. I didn't even lose a dog, you know, or cats. Because that's all of my animals. So I was really panicking about the weather. And then also, like, was it yesterday or today? Like I took pictures of the geese and Maria was also commenting on our feed that they sound very distressed. Now the birds were, it looked like the form of an opacity going over, like how she affects the sky. So she was over to the right of me here. And the birds were underneath her doing these figures of eight, like big clouds of them, like under there. And you could, I actually seen that the first time and I thought, look at that. These birds are doing this massive, massive thing, you know. Wow. And these are geese doing that? That's the case. We're doing that. It's like they did not know where they were going and they were severely agitated because Maria, being sensitive like she is to that with, you know, what she said to me, you know, she knows animals. So she said that they felt to me, even in a video that I'm not even in the environment, but they feel agitated, severely agitated, like, where are we going? And so it's obviously affecting the GPS. I mean, this electrical that's happening is very random. It seems like even the weather apps will one minute tell you one thing, and then you go back and it's changed within the 30 minutes. So you're like, Well, they're not taking into account the passing bodies and the weather that they call us and the asteroids below them and all of that and planetary none of that is taken into account. Everybody has to connect to science and they wonder why their equations don't work anymore. Nicole was talking about this. The Sahara, Rebecca had it posted there for a minute. She just pulled it down. The Sahara Desert has not always been like it is. Yeah, she's right. Yeah. I mean, they talk about the YDs and all that, you know, in the Egyptians. In the early Egyptian dynasties that was on. You know, they're finally coming to terms with some of the stones, even in the pyramids, etc. are actually concrete poured using limestone rather than carved. And yeah, they're finally starting to discover there's a whole bunch of stuff going on that they didn't look at properly because they don't grant technology to reality. They granted to the Western sciences and Western science says this and so anything outside that people don't talk about because then they lose accreditation and then lose their their respectability in the science community, blah, blah, blah. And we never we never worry about that here. I had a friend of some matter of facts. So why don't you write this paper and turn it into the Academy of Sciences so they can debate it with you. And I went, yeah, stick my head in the guillotine. You bet, you know, I want to, you know, raise a flag to me going, you know, if you don't know about me, then I don't want you to. But you know, yeah, the Sahara Desert was not always what the Sahara Desert looks like now. And this was a bunch of sand that blew in from the Far East. And that all had to do with climate change since the last cycle. And all of that dust and everything literally, they'd have to do a lot of check. But if you go down deep enough to find different colors of sand from different eras and different areas where it just blows in through the atmosphere from other regions. And you have to remember mountain ranges used to be taller and they get worn down. And they now one of the greatest contents on earth is silica. And silica doesn't break down. It just gets small. And a lot of our sand is silica. And you can you anyway, there's there's a whole research topic on that. Don't even get me started. But you look at sand under the microscope. That's also another kind of wonder, isn't it? Yeah. And you know, what's the difference between sea sand and desert sand? There's a big difference between that. And ocean sand, for example, some sand you can't use in cement, some sand you can use. The sand you can use in cement is on very short supply, believe it or not. It's we don't have a lot of that available on planet earth anymore. Because we've been using it all up. And that's a topic you can look up as well. That's an interesting dive down a new rabbit hole. But anyway, I digress. Are you ready to kick them off there, Rebecca? Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's I'm going to try that clip again and see if it will let me play it. And yeah, you're welcome, Nicole. You're welcome. For sure. Let's give it a go one more time and cross my fingers. Come on, boys. It says the browser, your browser is having trouble sharing your video. Well, keep working on it. Satan working on it. If anybody can find a way around something, it'd be me. So OK, let's what else? Oh, let's look at Christopher's videos. Yeah, they're so good. They're so good. Let's start the show with Christopher. And hopefully it shows. OK, let's try it again during the week. So I'm like, you know, earlier I was saying, you know, all we have to do is watch Christopher's videos and then we can go home because he said it all. We don't even need to do a show. Just watch Christopher's video. Right. We'll go home. The mini mini show. All right. Here we go. Click on those. Let's see. It looks good. Yeah. Yeah. We know they're some of them are working for you. Right. I know. I'm going to resave it and try it again. I even like the type. Yeah. Kabi knows that. No. No. Yeah, look at that thing. Yeah, the lines are even exactly right. They're just it. I'm telling you, you just put the overlay on. No adjustments. It's it's just perfect. It's incredible. It's like I took the paper and traced over the top of it. Yeah. And I didn't, of course, I don't even have any tracing paper. I put that on my shopping list. I need graph paper. I forgot about this. This was really weird. I was trying to find web cams to see if maybe my finds some good ones. But what was that? Oh, I remember you asked what that was. That that that's the tan asteroid. That's what I thought. Yeah. Yeah. That that illumination on the left is the tan asteroid. I could see I sat him in URI and then I thought, well, that has to be an asteroid or. And I sent to answer you on that on your video when I saw it. And I clicked off of it and didn't answer you. And I apologize. Yeah, I saw that the other day. And yeah, that's the tan asteroid illuminating. It's going to get bigger. It's going to get facially illuminated more. Yeah, right there. That big left blob there. That is the bottom of the tan asteroid and the salamander asteroid coming into around the rotational as URI orbits or rotates, I should say, and rises. And as it rotates, those asteroids, which are slowly angling out of the bottom of URI in the in the gas cloud mix pop out and then they become illuminated. And we've seen it years ago as well. And it's just back to being the cycle and October and it's going to be illuminated. Don't don't. I played this one so much. It is so perfect. I love it. It's just the skies get wild here. It's like Rebecca's skies. There's nothing. And then when we do get something happening, it just blows up. All right. Yeah. Right. Sorry, Chris. That's OK. You can see it with your own eyes. It's clouding on all. Nobody will use it or just leave the planet in sound. That's OK. She's a red asteroid right there in this shot. Right behind the death guy. Yep. It's it's there's no doubt in my mind now. It's just for so many months I just kept doubting it. And I don't know why my brain just would not allow me to accept it at all. Oh, we still argue with it. Everybody argues with this over and over again. It's not what we normally. Yeah, I mean, when have you ever seen a sky like that or that? Never. Never. Yeah, you know, or that. Look at that. And then I've got curves, man. Oh, I remember that one. That shot is from 2013 or 14. That's the lead asteroid crossing in front of the summit a few years ago. This of course, 2018. This is 20. OK, I can't keep up. It's 2020, 2021. Well, let's go lower. And it blows your mind to think that they're that. And how could this possibly be? But it's over and over. I have it that they're so they're so close and the fact that they travel so close together to it just doesn't. I guess there can be a that's totally normal because. There could be so many different combinations of how the planets can travel together and all sorts of solar systems. So I think our out view is partially magnified. You know, it's like looking through a glass of water. Yeah, it's the fishbowl effect. Yeah, you know, because I saw it in like in your videos in the coals videos and everything these planets look like they're immediately right next to each other and there's no way they that they can be. And yet in our out view like this light pincher, this is like shining between the planets. Nothing else can do that. Suddenly doesn't suddenly change shape in the sky unless there's something cutting it off. Between us and the sun. More information on the binary twin solar system. Follow the beer followers anonymous. So cool. And it happens over and over and now if it was just a one time thing all we saw this and we'd go yeah, it's clouds. Right. But we see this every day month in month out year in year out. We watch the progression. We watch them get bigger. I do my drawings. The drawings perfectly match all the time. My accuracy rate is scary. And it even bothers me because I am that accurate. It's weird. And all I do is draw out of what I see in my head. Yeah. I can imagine how you feel sometimes. Oh, I there's days that I sit there and I shake my head and go wow. And then there's days that I shake my head and go oh god, I hope I'm doing this right. So you know. I think you are. Yeah. I think we can say you're definitely a. If it ain't broken. It's broken. Right. I do have a lot of stress from this though. I mean it stresses me out. I don't want this to be happening. But it is. I don't want to have happening what I see is coming. And it is. It's spooky what we're headed to. It's only going to work. I had that dread feeling yesterday. Just thinking I just. Yeah. I think I would be so glad when the when this. Election season is over to. I'm so sick. I just read. Oh, it's green. No. I think everybody I think everybody on the planet is under an excruciating amount of stress right now from the planetary bodies going by and the asteroids going by and the electrical. Increase that's going on from the X cloud. We have another X class to flare today. So that'll be hitting us in a day or two. It's only a two but I mean it'll still it'll it's an X class. So it's going to it's going to. Somebody's saying it was a 3.3 that Leah Fox lady. Oh yeah. Well she gets a little bit carried away and worries a little bit much. Not that she doesn't do a good job but she's just a little bit overly concerned. Or that's how I take it. This is of course merely my opinion. There could be an entirely different story to it anyway. Yeah, well I think we're I think all of us are feeling the planets. I think a lot of us are sick to our stomachs. A lot of us our ears are ringing. We're body our body hurts. We're having new aches and pains new emotional troubles. There's these all these deep dark old hidden lost long ago faux pas in our past that are burping up in our laps every day. And thinking about things that we never even wanted to remember and yet here they come back to haunt us and there's a lot of that going on. And I'm experiencing it as well. And I try to work my way through it and go it's okay. It's okay. It's just something you're you're clearing the shelf. You're going to get through this. This is a positive thing. Not a negative. Don't get depressed. Blah blah blah. But I think we're all feeling some really really unusual very uncomfortable feelings around the world. I think everybody is feeling this. Not just not just me. Oh, I do have a question for you again. Some some questions from Audrey in South Africa. She's got somebody asking her things about the planet. So she says, please ask Sam a question for me. A friend of mine asked me if it was possible for a solar system to have one group of planets and two suns. No, it is possible. Depending on the proximity. Now there are suns. There are stars out there that that new stars are embedded partially sticking out of old stars. So there's all kinds of different ways the stars can can facilitate. They can be really, really closely binary attached with one solar system. I would imagine it's possible. But generically, it has to do with then you'd have to be looking at a two atom atomic structure with very low protein. And there are low counts of neutrons and electrons. So it would be an early it would be a very early solar system because it would continue to add to the compounding as long as it's within its chemistry constraints. And yeah, yeah, there's all there's billions of solar systems. So yeah, you can have any kind of variation there. I mean, right. High group of stars, distant stars, stars that orbit around each other very vastly different, but yet they're vastly far apart from each other. And yet they're still electrically attached because of whatever compound. I'm sure that there's solar systems out there with four stars or five stars, live atoms, four atoms, three atoms, two atoms. It's a rarity to have one star and one solar system. It's only 83, not yet 17%. So and the billions of different possible equations than you know, 17% of them can have one or two stars and beyond. Watch Carl Stegen in the billions and billions of stars. And that's probably a small estimate number two. Oh, not all that. They're finding out how little they do actually know. You know, here they're talking about they think the universe, the big bang and all is eight points. You know, I mean, you get two scientists in the room and they don't even agree on the dates. But anyway, 8.6, 8.2 billion years old. We talked about this last week on last show. And here they've discovered a star that is, you know, 12.6 billion years old. Well, excuse me, it shows you how little you do know. Now remember, everything we're looking at is all shit in the past. All the light took all these millennium to get here. So we don't even really have an abject out view of reality. We're looking at only light emitted in the past. So we don't even have a concept of the now in space and they're stumbling and going, yeah, we know, we know, no, you don't. You assume, you know. But I mean, if you're big, if you're piggybacking off Einstein and gravity, then you don't know. It's that simple. You know, maybe some of your equations work, but the rest of them don't. And then they go, oh, well, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, because if we watch our experiments, they're not going to come out. No, no, that's an excuse. So you get your paycheck next month. And that was 1880 and we're still running out of it. Oh, I got to get my tenure. You know, I got to keep teaching as a college professor. So because I watched my experiment, it didn't turn out right. Okay, Skippy. Yeah, well, you know, and then they say, well, the science is correct. No, the science isn't correct. We do not live in a gravitational universe. There is so much more going on than that. We live in an electrical universe, atomic structure, atoms, protons, neutrons, electrons. What works in the subatomic also works in the athroatomic. And that is the mission, the missing link that Einstein couldn't fathom. And that is the unification model. What works in chemistry, subatomic to asterotomic, one set of rules. That's simple. And anything more complicated is it's absurd. It's ridiculous. It's simpler than that. And that's why they're missing it because it's just right there. He also had a question about that step. There's this picture that you always show us this, the king pointing at the things in the heavens. Yeah, yeah. Love that. Yeah. So you wanted you to describe what those objects are that he's pointing at again. Well, we'll point at the second object up. On the left hand side. That's the lead object in the asteroid object cluster group. I said that was the cluster group there. We have early years, the 2018 and 2019 pictures on that Hopi picture. Yes, that Rebecca just showed a few minutes ago in your video, I believe Christopher that white everybody thinks is a watermark. No, that's the illuminated object cluster group. And that's that's the second icon on the left that he's pointing to. And the bigger one, of course, would be Yuri and Attu below it. And then you go up and you see there's a square on that as well up toward the top there in the middle. And that would be the cubes. And speaking of the cubes, a fun. I posted a really awesome photograph this last two days or so because I just got it today. I'll get that. He's got some incredible pictures this week. Oh, yeah, that was the lead asteroid wasn't it that monster on the right? No, the one the picture I'm talking about a font captures the two cubes parked next to each other. Oh, yeah. And the text is cube were in the same shot one right next to the other. And I didn't comment on the on his page about that because I didn't, you know, want to stick my neck too far out. But I guess I'm publicly doing that in voice. So, you know, there are times I say something and other times I just hold my tongue until I think about it for a while. And usually I'll come back to think two or three times and look at something. But I looked at it a couple of times today already and I went, Oh, my God, that's both cubes. Bear with me. And yeah, I have it ready to say I was getting ready to do that. But I'll go ahead and get that finished up. I do have Jillian's pictures ready. I make sure I got him saying though I say I have them ready, but I just sent them over. So let's see if they're here. So with that, we should see some really interesting glories again here tomorrow or so. I'd have to look up when that wave is going to hit us. Great. I don't know if I could take any more. So yeah, we do feel we do feel the field effects on the earth. There are more earthquakes. There is more electrical activity. Our internet service goes down a radio wave service, you know, radio in your car stereo goes off. You know, it'll. The lights at work were fluttering too. Lights and work or generators will burn out. People have already forgotten the one that one flare that we had huge that actually affected the Hoover Dam. One of their transformers actually burned out during one of those. And they're going pop all over the world. But we don't see those videos. Those generators are blowing up all around, you know, Thailand and Malaysia and Germany and Turkey and Afghanistan or Poland. We don't see those videos because nobody slaps the, you know, puzzle pieces together. All these electrical generators and dams are blowing up or this generator blows up or that generator blows up. And they don't connect the dots. And if you started studying and had like a Google list or an AI, check that information for you. You could actually probably find out that during the solar players, lots of other shit is happening, including earthquakes and volcanoes and your home computers and your cell phones and your cable TV are all messed up. And I think sound has a great deal to do with that as well. That reminds me of this clip, Sam, 2018. This is December 2018. And I remember it really well. I will shoot a heavens with three quarters of stars in his tail that's speaking. Oh yeah. Anyway, that and I remember, you know, this was happening and an opacity is there. And within, you know, minutes, the media was all over this, say, and blown transformer, just a transformer. Don't pay any attention, you know. But they're not, you know, acknowledging, you know, what's going on. You can't miss that. You've got to say something. Oh boy, they're winning on TV. I remember this pic very well. I've seen it a few hundred times. I have a copy of it. And I never actually swallowed the full entire what this was. Wow. And I am highly tempted to still go. I'm torn in two directions. It's either the eye on tail off the face of a satin or it is the star destroyers all illuminating in front of the long box cube. What? Okay. Wow. Something. I know. Like, I've never seen anything like that since. Yeah. I mean, there's, I was, I was going to be direct. And the only thing that could illuminate like this with that many dots is the green asteroid and that is not the green asteroid. Right. And so it literally, and I just, I'm torn. 50%, 45% of me says it's at the Michelle Amoon eye on tail somehow and some odd illumination. And the other 50, 55% goes to those are the star destroyers offloading around the long box cube and they're being eliminated from underneath. Oh, sunset. Because of the randomness of it, especially the one, two, three, four, five, six over to the right there. Right. And if you blow that up, I can make it bigger. And what I'm looking at here one second. Yeah. They do look very triangular. They do. And I never wanted to go there because I couldn't, I couldn't care between the Saturn, Jell-O-Moon, Eye on Tail and or asteroids or star destroyers. But I, I'm more prone to star destroyers parked around the long box cube. Anyway. Wow. Not perfect science. It's just, you know, we try to go through the options of what it could be what we, based on what we've seen in the past, based on what we know is where. And this one always, you know, I was never completely comfortable with what I'm looking at. And yes, the green area is bottom illuminated core of planet, uh, nepacity and it's glowing. It's, it's pulsating. And was during a solar burst, the bottoms of the planets will pulsate and glow in from the stellar material. It's basically like the aurora borealis on our North Pole, but that's the aurora borealis on the southern pole of planet nepacity. Wow. And you know, everybody knows that the planets ever since the second star got here, all of a sudden there's been hexagons and auroras at the poles, both North and South Pole of Saturn and Uranus and Venus and Jupiter and Mercury and Earth. We've had glowing crown and a growing, glowing South Pole. And of course they're not showing you those pictures. Yeah, that's a fawns. Look at that. Longbox cube and the Texas cube parked next to each other. The longbox is in front and the much bigger Texas cube is behind it. Wow. That blows me away. Yeah. What does that mean when they park next to each other? Or is that just happens to be the out view? Or are they just that close? Or is it invasion time? And I don't want to go there. Look at the side orb. Yeah. Wow. Look at that. Oh my gosh, that is clean as day. There is no doubt about it. All's under the criteria, doesn't it? Wow. And we know the ship. And you know, like that video that I don't know which one of you guys made the ET video. The excerpt of me going, hey guys, by the way, ET's here. By the way, guys, ET's here. Thank you, Afon, for showing us more evidence. Wow. You know, ET is here. Thank you, Patrick. Also, thank you, Patrick. Thank you. It's good to see you again too. I was just seeing your name last night. I was just watching at some things and it's been a few months. So good to see you, Patrick. Appreciate that. I really wonder what, you know, they being up on these big, massive intergalactic square craft, I wonder what their view of us is, you know, looking down on her, you know, and it's probably vacation to them. You know, oh, cool. We get to go to another planet and see new things, you know. What? Wow. Hey, it's Ricolette. Thank you. That's nice. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, Ricoli. I'll let your tardiness slide. Yes. Wow. Yeah. Did you see that? Look at that. Hello, lead asteroid. How are you? God, it's big. Let's go back. Let's go back. Yeah, these are both, those two videos are both from Afon and now the Eaves. That's, it's Atom's Yellow Moon is the dark area and then the light blue behind it is it's Atom. And there's the lead asteroid. This is a couple of days ago. This is like a week ago. Wow. That's crazy. Yeah. I want to pull your drawing set. Except for going the opposite direction of what we've ever seen it before. Yeah, like this is going downward, but that one's coming in from the right, which is what, which is what's most gruey about the lead asteroid being way, way out. And there are times I want to call it its own planet. There's times I want to say it's a moon. But that is the second object up in that drawing or the, or the cartouche of King David pointing his finger up into the sky, warning people. He's pointing to it. He's telling you they are coming. I know if you look at that picture that way, but that's the object that is the second icon up with the little tail behind it. Because originally when it got here, the lead asteroid was, that's why we call it the lead asteroid because it was actually in front of everything. That's what we saw first. And then after a while we realized, hey, look, there's dark blobs behind these objects in the object cluster group. And that's when we went, shit, those are planets. And then it just, it, you know, just escalated from there going, oh, you get God, you can see, you can blow it up. Oh God. Yeah, you can see it. And that was 2009 to 2011. Wow. That photo should be making, you know, worldwide news as far as I'm concerned. Yeah. Yeah. It's an absolute, absolutely. Yeah. People should be tracking it all over the place and just seeing where it is all the time. That could be on time news. How come it's not? That's my question. I'm going to go through the trail of it again right there. Right. I was going to say, do you see that Sam? It looks like it's moving right in front of our eyes there. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. Yeah. Yeah. Which says, which tells you asteroid because asteroids leave the trails behind them and planets do not. Now planets leave ion spirals behind them through their pathway, especially famously inificity, because it's such a small planet that it actually does have an interaction between the larger planets in our planet and it creates this illumination ion cloud, sort of piggy tail as it drops, as it moves. We saw that years ago. We haven't seen that recently because I had to do with angle of light and all that versus the sun. Now, yeah, that's the site of Yuri right there. Bridged dark edges. that is the side of his Atom or yeah, or no that might be the city coming over and in front. I don't know There's there's a planet there. There's a that's that's Awesome Those are not those are not our clouds those clouds are not in our atmosphere. Look at the size of them Well, hello all you space cruisers up there look at all of those Star destroyers I know David one of bonds material Various people on Facebook. Yeah, I mean on in there in our groups people that were in the groups, uh-huh So yeah, yeah Look at those those are objects those are planet guys. This is this is UK Yeah, this was in the UK yesterday Yeah, this week has been bizarre It's just been like the clouds open up at certain times and you see all this crazy stuff It looks like see the right of a surface out tipped axis. That's you Wow Great, huh? And you know in the stripes We see the gas That's the same as the base cloud of Yuri The picture before this one this one I can't go back. This one. I have to look back Yeah, that's the base cloud of your Coming in from the last tip tack. Yeah. Yeah, it's like a skid thing Like It is it is warming up That's why you have a vertical raise of the facial clouds and why it looks so Wave-like because when the Sun shines on a gas giant those gases interact and then they create their little eddy clouds and all of that Now look at the size of these clouds. They're not our clouds. Those are the clouds the upper literally 80% of this picture is not our clouds only the stuff at the horizon belongs to us The rest of that should be clear blue with a few short puppy Cumulus or cumulus Nimbus cloud crossing but that would be normal but the rest of that is not normal You're looking at the rounded face of Yuri did that old old Yuri picture from 2018 or so is the best example of that when it's way smaller and you can see actually the whole entire planet in one shot and the stripes Yuri and that's what made it you know that Yuri's a gas giant because of the stripes We know that at twos a smaller gas giant because it has stripes. They're angled Whereas Yuri's are horizontal, but at twos are good. They go at an angle and We've known for many years that they're both gas giants and then it fits the the crop circles and it fits all of the The the big, you know stone slab carvings around the planet and all of this information has been logged down and left to us It's just how you interpret these things and we we at Montana sky watcher and never followers anonymous and And the other sister sites have all been doing our homework We're always gathering all of this information from around the world and everybody sends it in and then we correlate all of this information What this what doesn't get tossed out? what fits stays and Only through all of this participation from members around the world Were we able to get to the stages we are today? Yeah, it's taken what 15 years almost we're gonna be April April next year. Okay. Yeah. All right. Yeah, April night. Believe it or not Here is a video clip April night. I'll remember that Let's see I just saw this on tiktok and to me this stood out as Symbolism for the long box cube. So let me know what you all think. Here we go I'm like, what is that and why is he on this ginormous? Yeah, I don't know. I'm sending a message. Uh-huh. That's Justin Timberlake concert I Sting off the top of the long rock cube. How interesting that's how they send messages. I Wonder what the words to the song are Did have a side orb? Right, right, right. I just thought that was different Yeah, that is strange That is very symbolic. Why would he be why would the angle chip it like that? Yeah You know why not have a flag horizontal safe? I mean, could you imagine if that thing dropped on the audience? Oh my gosh Yeah This is not me. It's gonna drop in on somebody's well This looks to me like a very large ocean nightmare that I can't even believe they approved doing this Hmm, all those people if that anything went wrong with that you'd have 150 dead people Man, yeah That is strange I wonder what the message is We see a lot of this where where shapes and things keep popping in and they're all oddly similar Right, have you ever seen like, um, you know like sculptures or you know, um I guess you call it an effigy or something where it's a cube. They always have them in like city centers You know shapes of black cubes or anything But the long box cube anywhere like that. That's the first time I've ever seen anything. Well, look at look at the Look at the hot Look at some jewish, uh Right sec religion said that I have a little cube stuck on their forehead. That's a leg tracing Have you ever have here ever wondered why the the the muslims are not allowed to have depictions of their gods in their churches Because if they knew which group that they actually are Anyway, I I can't say too much but there's a reason for that Let's put it that way why they don't have effigies of their god that the god that they worship painted on their walls Um, I love I love their sanskrit, uh writing in their beautiful beautiful temples and but there's a lot more to it There is more to it and and there's a twist of a hunting twist and you can look up Who the magi were to the greeks? And if you're out there and you're a sleuth and you want to study what the el sam often is saying this week And what's he hinting about go look that up Who were the magi to the greeks? Hmm Okay the oracle and the delphi and all of that look into that Because the greeks knew we had two stars. Yeah, absolutely And they even talk about it in some of their texts and if you all you have to do is you want to translate the colburn bible or the green tablets of thought You take into account the binary solar system and all the pieces fit together Or even talk about the gin. Oh god, don't even get me started. Yeah Oh, there is so much to the gin and they're you know, there are other creatures We could talk about skin walkers. We can talk about big but we could talk about a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot But you know I could keep going and you know, you know Pretty off topic, but um, there's a lot more going on Then we little humans Are aware of and we do not own earth We don't own it It's not ours to claim but boy, we're sure trashing it anyway. Oh What do you got for us there rebecca? Before I Know Oh Oh my god, can you believe people are throwing their garbage on the ground upset. I'm upset I mean my god, we we cleaned that we cleaned up this planet in the 70s by the day I I cleaned I cleaned up tons of garbage in the 70s. There was this big movement where people cared The hell happened to that anyway I Yeah, there's It's just bag after bag full of plastic bags full of plastic because everything you buy at the store is wrapped in plastic Or containers are plastic. It's just uh, it makes me sick because like, you know, what can you do? What can one actually do? It's breaking down. It's getting in our food. It's getting in our water. It's getting in us in our bodies in our bodies statistically they say that we eat a credit card size worth of plastic like I don't know if it's every month or every year but I got to look at it again, but Oh, you you should see the the size wad of human hair that we eat Every year. Oh, yeah, that's that's a weird one. Yeah, don't get me started on how much pico material We touch around the world from other our family and people around us Austin hands Yeah, oh god For real david and patrick. Yeah, uh, I don't know You know, it's one of those medical things where they pump uh materials back into somebody's body who's been highly uh, Medicated with antibiotics and then they pump you back with all kinds of bacteria just to get you back to normal Yeah Well, in fact, the mexicans take antibiotics every year twice a year, but you don't hear about that Because there it's it's not the water. It's the it's the bacteria and the dirt in Mexico And anybody who anybody who lives in Mexico knows that and twice a year you take antibiotics period Because you have to Oh, I you know, I'm amazed that we're out of the cave for gods, right? I'm amazed that there's no 11.9 billion of us on this planet all Pian and poop and then throwing our garbage in the streets. Just uh, it's just sickening I wish you would all go away. I'm joking. I'm joking Or when somebody's driving down the street and you see them throw their fast food crap out the window or yeah, oh man Hey, if I see if I see If i'm walking in the truck stop to pay for my gas And there's a piece of garbage on the street in front of me and i'm walking that way anyway I pick it up and then I bring it to the garbage can It's that simple if you see it do it if you see something wrong fix it We're all responsible. We can't we cannot we can't say somebody else does that's what's wrong Everybody said, I'm not responsible. We are all of us are this is why I always say be excellent excel in what you do Don't be what everybody else is Yes, Nicole humans never did own earth We were well, it was owned. Well, it wasn't owned when we were first put here but then That boils down to when we were first because we aren't what we used to be so we How you know can you go across that? Street and say yeah, we were Do we are because we're a completely different animal now than we used to be Uh, so anyway and many different versions there in as well and that goes beyond knowledge or measure of time There's no way for me to factually hand you that information, but I know it's true because I mean we have traits and and Video synchrises and good points and bad points that are all intentionally placed within us and that is original sin. We are originally made this way for a reason And our I mean can you imagine how long how many millions of years it took us to learn to use our hand? Just our right hand or our left hand As as as far as evolution and skills and the stuff that that we run off of and when we think about people in 500 dc Are are are those people cavemen? Or did they have bad skills that we don't even appreciate to this day and some of the tools and mechanisms and the things That they used in their daily life, which were actually genius to their age And there was a great awakening in 500 bc and barely anyone accounts for that And there were vastly intelligent brilliant minds at the at the time around the planet in 500 bc so there's Western science has really done us a disservice by saying that only they know And this is how things are according to some guy in england that wrote a book I mean Techno technological civilization right now, but Oh, so much the church fortunately has destroyed so much information since the first Spanish inquisition on The the destruction of of the information that at Alexandria library alone You know and at home with there sacking of Alexandria and oh man, you know some of that's like nine miles offshore underwater And and there's just so much that you know, we don't know about what we used to be And unfortunately they're they're only stabbing. You know, they're throwing darts at a dartboard here And it's just it's horrible what we don't know I was told a bunch of stuff from pleiadian and it's just like oh my god How do I ever explain that to anyone because you know, I would be Joan of Arc at the stake And they'd be putting the matches on that byla sticks going how dare you say that and so there's things I can't tell you guys I I already say too much as it is I really do And that glimmer of hay You know that glimmer of hope that the proper message is going to go forward and we're going to do good And everything's going to be all right, and you know, and we're you know, we're actually going to be in a better world. Well that's kind of true But we're also we're also in a world hurt right now by the way people are behaving and governments and and factions and political parties and All people are stealing from each other and how much scamming and conning and going all around the world through the internet And how many old people are being taken? Advantage of by con artists and hackers and oh my god. What what kind of world do we live in? What have we become? Now we can't go back We can't go well back in yesteryear. We didn't have that because now we have the problem The question is what do we do with it? How do we react and how do we change it? How would we change it for the better without lopping people's heads off because that's no answer either You know you can't just pop the dandelion Head off and say okay the plant's not there Because the dandelion will come back if you just top the top off you've got to actually get to the root of the problem And you know an example is the mendett menendez brothers They were cruising for life and now uh, they're actually we're a software society in certain ways And harsher and others but um, we're actually looking at the what these two young teenage men went through through sexual abuse and I should be careful. I don't there's a flag word as well through abuses And they couldn't take it anymore. So they literally supposedly Allegedly committed these murders And now they're getting re-looked at so um, how we view things as a society is is the main topic of what i'm trying to bring up Um things that I could tell you today Five years from now may not even be as important or they would be even substantially more important Uh, uh, you're only going to get information when you're ready for it And society is really a ticking time bomb right now. We are we're we are in a crossroads And I I I hope that we make the right choices and try to do the right thing instead of falling into the complacency or the lies and Uh, you know A good man who sits by and does nothing Is just as evil as the man who does it a good man actually has to go in there and change things to make it better You can't watch it go by Absolutely You gotta let you gotta get involved And that's why i'm involved I have to be involved I have to you know, it's not me. Oh, I want to say my thing because I'm so cool That's not why i'm doing this because this is very uncomfortable for me Uh, we were talking about before the show in the green room I every show I do and I'm in a couple. I've done a couple hundred interviews or podcasts or mixed all together Whatever you want to call it And I'm still nervous every time every show and uh, so The the the the important thing is the message. That's why we're doing this because these are real. This is happening I mean, you know, we couldn't make up this is saptam's yellow moon crap at all And no we couldn't make up the lead astra going in front of a satan's yellow moon and his saptam On the right hand side of the sky, but the last you know since 2019 We couldn't be doing that. We wouldn't be this accurate. You can't fake this shit and it's really happening And Nobody sees it. It's just like you've got it. You don't see that. Oh, you what oh, I just see clouds. No Open your mind Hey Open your mind quade and that came from uh, that mark movie with arnold schwarzson. They go. What was that? Oh, yeah, recall Little recall. Yeah, open your mind quade Yeah And that's the thing you just got it. You got it You go outside you look up if you see a really screwy dark area in the sky You're looking at a passing planet That's all there's to it And then you then hone your skills in from that and then find the asteroids and then find the order which planets on which side of the sun It took a lot of people a lot of time to learn these things some people less than others some people longer than others and uh It's really happening It's really you know, this is how I can in my head I can sit down in front of a in front of a piece of paper in my in my dining room And draw something without the aid of a computer because it's in my head because it's really happening because i'm watching it And and I see it and I draw it and yeah, I've got a little bit of practice. I'd have been doing it for you know, you know 13 10 11 years before I was doing cutouts and we're doing quick hand drawings and stuff like that You know wiper board and stuff, you know a little white board where you draw stuff and then you wipe it away and change it And then I went to paper cutouts because gave me the opportunity to cut out. They were fun Yeah, they they and then we they all we can also Give the opportunity to show the movement of the transition of where we were moving And I could use it with a little pointer and I was using a cursor and I can you know And you for those early videos you can go back to understanding the sky series on youtube under sam hoffman And that's hoffman with one f and that way you'll find it better And yeah, those are you and I wish I could do those again, but uh, Unfortunately facebook and youtube have uh stalled my ability to hand out movies Uh, I can't even I can't even use skype anymore, and I don't know why no one no one's answered that for me So I you know and we have we have issues we have issues and here I'm paying you know this exuberant fee for Great download, but really crappy upload so no talent and I mean, who do you who do you complain to? They look at you like you're nuts I You know, I can't even I I I call the the company that I'm paying and I can't even get to a human I know And and I've tried many times and they you can't even all you get is computer And you know say this and say that and the recognize you know You recognize what you're saying yes or no or three or five and you know And your options and then they keep transferring you and we'll check your system We're checking. They take 20 25 seconds Please hold on you know and they just do a scan of your system and then you never get to talk to a human being at all Unless you're trying to cancel your service or something. I don't know. I don't know what it takes to talk to them He's got to keep telling the operator. I want to speak to an agent or something like that. Give me a human right Do you know what really drives them that if you actually Uh type in the wrong thing on the numbers and that then they eventually give you to somebody because then they're almost dribbling If answered all you've you've gone and pressed all their buttons and they're freaking out now because It's not working That's the one that was up against the wall or something This is the bottom of the opacity Wow And probably one of our big three asteroids Okay That's cool. This one is that nice one Yeah, so the green part is the opacity like the entire green area. It's right. Yeah Yeah, wow With Yuri behind it on the left at the lower horizon middle And that white purplish dot on the left is probably one of the big three on the bottom of the opacity Took a lot of years to actually attribute the big three to opacity, but I finally just said, okay They're always there. So I'm going to just finally agree with it And there's some sort of a trail in front of it in the middle there between the the dot and the sun Don't know what that is It could be a street trail It's like going up and down and that's And there's you know like yeah, look at that look at that. Whoa I couldn't decide What is that Sam? I mean, I've seen that on video that round, you know, this is a screenshot from the video But okay, how old is that video? How old is the video? Um Let me see if I can find it. Uh, I don't I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I think that was current You got the red asteroid in the left corner The lead acid red asteroid is in the left corner coming right after all And then over on the right is lead asteroid And it's coming down at that angle from in front of the sathom sathom jello moon And if you look to the right of the palm tree On the right hand side, you can actually see the moon pockmarks of the sathom jello moon. Wow Where On the right of the tree on the right hand side of that whole big dark area If you look at those pockmarks, those are moon craters Here's another one. Yeah And what's that red thing look at the red thing Well, the red thing is his sathom behind it Yeah, and and the the the the circular perfectly smooth looking circular Round thing between the two palm trees above to the right of the sun is the lead asteroid And it's coming in from the upper left leading downward And you can see the little path that it's coming in just like this month's secondary drawing Uh But it just happens to be a focal illumination of perfect timing You can see the stripe in the upper right face of the lead asteroid. There is that stripe. It's there I can even blow it up even bigger here. Yeah Yeah, that's the spatial stripe at that angle Just like the monthly site drawing that's special It's gotten big in the last week very big and I did not draw it big enough this month I I was telling everybody I was going to draw them all bigger and I didn't And I needed to I needed to draw the lead asteroid I yeah, I would have covered everything Paper sheet I didn't even put never knew in the drawing this month in october's never was not even on the drawing Because it's over far over to the right shoulder behind us off the drawing And so I didn't include it And over time i'm gonna have to start drawing different, you know ways to show this in a solar system rotation with little arrows and all of that and It's gonna have to change how i'm drawing things I don't want to but I There well, well there it's gonna have to be a new way to describe this And i've done a couple of drawings Intermittently for the last couple of months showing orbit models and directions and you know Read them out and made them smaller that sort of thing so you can get a better idea placement And then i'm gonna actually have to draw the arm reaches of the two armed octopus of the solar system The reason I say that is there's two arms to this solar system So system you have nibiru and isatum on one arm On one side of the solar system and on the other solar system side of the solar system You have seru uri atu and nepecite and matim all in one area And on that a secondary arm Here we go. Here we go. Sorry. There's your drawing Yeah, the october monthly site drawing And the right asteroid should have been bigger the tan asteroid should have been bigger lead asteroid should have been bigger The big three should have been bigger Nepecite should have been bigger So and they keep moving back and forth and back and forth a little bit here a little bit there And pretty much before you know it is satum's yellow moon is going to be so big It's going to literally fill the only part of the right hand side And I mean it almost deserves that now because it is when it's going over the top of us at sunset In the north by northwest sky I saw it the other day Can't argue with it. There it is. No wow. Wow. You know, there it is. Oh my god And it's so prominent at sunset and it's so huge now And like I've said, you know it doesn't times before We've never seen isatum as close to us ever before on their first original approach 2015 16 17 Uh and then exiting in 18 19, etc. And then coming back toward us in 2021 22 23, etc This is the closest we've ever seen a satum the satum's yellow moon and every day is new. It's awesome awesome And oh my god, some of those pictures last week and that big red thing and everybody in the middle east and and the Mediterranean and and and you know, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. They're getting these orange shots And and all these beautiful red skies and everything and it's very intense very insane Now the picture on the top left Is like a week before this drawing on the bottom left Uh, but that is literally, uh What's going on as well? I didn't use that Drawing in my head. Although I do I do think that is one of the best drawing or the best picture captures We've gotten in a very long time. This is the upper right one Or excuse me upper left one. Um, that's an awesome awesome shot of a satum a shallow moon in front of a satum And then on top of it lead asteroid is also there And I hadn't even Imagine that when I saw that picture And now that we see that comparison. Yes, as a matter of fact, it is there. It's exactly It's actually exactly correct even though I didn't see that originally And then yeah, and the atu and atu's moon Are very prominent and we're going to see atu a lot more And then atu's moon is going to be over the top of us more So we'll be seeing the bottom of atu more and we'll be seeing a lot more of the skull asteroid Because the skull Yeah, everybody's getting more captured with the skull asteroid and it's very big and it's very scary Perfect timing for october halloween Yeah, like that in the year of the dragon no less So this ought to be a breeky october I mean everybody looked up on on halloween night. Maybe you know, maybe the skull asteroid's going to be red and scary invisible in the sky Wouldn't that be cool? We'll put in our requisition for that or right here right now writing it down on paper mailing it to the Uh, maybe mailing it to the space gods. Here you go. This is my request October 31st. I'd like to see a very large very massively huge red skull asteroid visible of the world to see in the wind god wouldn't that be cool? Yeah, I would scare the crap out of three quarters of the planet Sometimes I you know, I don't want to wish anything like that, but I think people need a shock I think people need to wake up that this shit is really happening and they should watch our shows And you know and binge watch still like catch up You know, you got a lot of material to catch up on guys. Yeah It's just fascinating four series of videos and 14 years worth of work and thousands and thousands of sightings over Hundreds of thousands of sightings over 14 years Millions of sightings. I mean, I you know, I hate to use the word millions because I don't want to go there It's a very large number, but we I mean, we've been busy, you know, we've been busy Yeah, I'll never forget when we were first watching the lead asteroid come in And it was doing that that dragon tail illumination and everybody's freaking. Oh, it's wormwood. Yes, you're right. It is wormwood And I didn't go there for years because I didn't want to freak out any little old ladies, you know And oh where would the destroyers coming in? We're all gonna die You know, and I thought that up to a point around up until like 2013 that we were in far deeper shit than we are Although is we still are But I thought that, you know, those asteroids were going to paste us Or smaller stuff and some did, you know, the the charlie benzky event um And there's more of it going on right now and we're of course in another meteor shower the oriented, uh Don't miss read that this week. Anyway, ha ha. Yeah Uh guys, this shit's real and these are damn close and and wormwood the destroyer or the dragon because it is the year of the dragon That's why it's the year of the dragon because it's stickly-climatching reality That's in the last 8 000 years. Anyway uh And this is all real and it's all real. It's all real. It's all real Yeah, look at the light cut off And yet, you know on the left hand upper picture you're seeing this like looks like a blue sky to me But why is the sun doing that? Look it's got laser beam blue light coming at it. Yeah, why is it making that refractive flaring because it is refractive from Something cutting off the top of it just like going on the right Because it's pinched The light pinch it's shining underneath these planets that are right here one of another examples of proof That these are happening including for instance the example of 2011 all of a sudden the sun started rising in the northeast sky Barely ever gets any attention I love that lightning bolt shot That light in yorgy it is rounding the tan asteroid. Yeah wow And lorraine and pappy and all the other asteroids that are in that mix And this is how close it's getting let me see i'm gonna blow that up to see what what that must be a single shot too I mean, yeah, it's not it's not time lapse Thailand, you know, okay this month Uh in Thailand in this month and look this is the this is the the center of the of the earth and That tan asteroid is freaking huge And I think this is one of the coolest pictures of that we've ever gotten Wow The lightning going up Yeah They call that It's going around something. Yes Making that's going around it's going around the actual tan asteroid just as the drawing is below it That's exactly what is there and you can see it rounding This the other smaller asteroid to the left below it and that is pappy And it's reaching over behind over to lorraine which is behind and and beside the tan asteroid It's in the drawing it's above but it is actually Currently beside it farther forward a little bit word of the right because this is an older drawing from september of last year So the angles have changed but look the drawing is september of last year Here we are in september of october of this year and look what's in our faces cyclically annually again at the end of the 180 day cycle Oh, I wish I could answer that for you. The asteroid is so big It's mind-blowing how big that thing is it is Oh god, maybe a third of the size of the moon and that's just a guess right That's we have no way to measure that but here here's an example This is the lead asteroid about four years ago When it was really really big In 2020 it was amazingly large and i'm amazed it didn't actually skip off and you know scrape a mountain away Because that's how close Currently the the closest skimmer off the deck or off the horizon is the spiral asteroid Okay, but we're seeing that same pattern in our out view and that's that same group They're all in the pretty much similar plane of Orbitation below Yuri and at 2 and now these asteroids are attached to the gas giants along with many many other smaller asteroids and Billions of smaller debris asteroids and dust and you name it and we watched all of that for years But they're on the same path and that path is spread out and it sort of spins around if you like as if you had a child with They're spinning a circle with their arms out and these things spin and now currently the uh a more notable spiral asteroid, which is much smaller There's actually two of them in a whole bunch smaller stuff, which is now larger Is is visible but we can actually see it going as the planets go over us and then rotate We can actually see the spiral asteroid bank turning in front of us Whereas the lead asteroid is now doing that in a different way Uh, and we're seeing it what used to go from left to right now We're seeing it literally coming from upper right going almost downward angle left And it's not anywhere close to the satan and satan jala moon It's just visually in the same out view Because the lead asteroid is attached to atu and urie. It's not willy nilly separate But it's in a way spinning arm asteroid Outreach in front of the base of urie and atu Because all of that at the 180 day cycle end is really really close to earth As we go into our winter orbit and change placements It's spooky all and this is where we always worry about the end of the 180 day cycle and the beginning Because that's when we see most of the volatile activity Super hey more lead object. I these are just some of the best ones the best pictures the best of the best, you know Yeah, this is of course this this is uh satan jala moon being illuminated here In this shot So good and this is okay. This might be my favorite picture Yeah, that is of course way smaller way smaller as satan in front of the abaroo And that that white line with the purple Uh to the right hand side of the sun is the ion Tail so that goes around asatum and that's this clouded Plain like pattern ion tail goes around both sides of asatum But it comes off of the yellow moon And of course the blue dot in in front of it or it's actually a green dot That is the the green asteroid above the sun at that time and this was like 2019 that this picture was captured and we refer that to the the dr. Phil era Because this was taken by a group of people and I believe dr. Phil is the one that shared this And that's spelled f i l not ph i l I mean the bureau is huge Look how big that planet is If you were to make a full circle or draw it out It the bureau is so big. Oh, that is that is a massive massive sky filler And you should have seen the never ruin 2012. It was still huge and yet it was so far away And i'm sitting here watching it out in my front yard, you know, i'm going there. Oh, look at that. Oh, look at that And I sat for hours and watching I you know and I said this over Over again, but you know, we had 80 people 80 members 200 members 300 500 members whatsoever and they all thought I was talking out of my mind you know and But we've seen it. It's there. It's real and and the the sad thing is there's so many people missed Out on the early years Oh my god, you guys have missed Wow, there's an early one too. This is what I don't know the year on this one Look at that. It's so good. Wow. No, this is 2022 And that is a very rounded is satum And then a much smaller satum yellow moon And along the way there and there's a couple of star destroyers or the middle right Oh, yeah, look at that Yeah Wow, okay Upper top up there. There's a couple star destroyers Yeah, and they're there. I can see remember i'm looking at a 43 inch screen And I'm glad I didn't go bigger because by the way those bigger screens don't last as long Anytime you go over 50 inch screen you're throwing your money away because they won't last six months Too bad Yeah, I well more pictures are very much alike, you know, we have a repetitive You know, so you see the shadows, right and then there's another one. Yeah, just hold it there for me Everybody learn Learn to look at the dark areas in the photograph first If you look at that big bright center, you're not going to see what's there But if you start on the dark areas before you know it these planets will pop into your eye And you go, holy shit on the left hand side. Look the stripes of Yuri Or you look on the right hand side. Holy shit There's the south and jello moon with the eye on jail coming off his face And you can see the differences on either side that you can see the two different And they match and they match and they match and they match and they match a month after month after month and year after year And that's how we know which planet is where Okay, the date on this is this is 2017 so now this one is completely different photograph We have Yuri on the right We have seru on the left. Wow. Yeah Yeah But still there's The lead asteroid the lead asteroid is that little white blip Right next to the f for the the loop of of the of the watermark on that picture, right where it says 2017 05 That white blip is the lead asteroid. See I have tail behind it Yeah Huh, and that's actually the lead asteroid the blue asteroid and the green asteroid are all right there They're just so small you can't see them But they're there in the same group matters course in front of Yuri and at you Which are on the right There's another one. Wow And yeah, and this again. Okay. This is years later. Let me blow this up so I can see the date Which will be sort of cheating because I can kind of tell that it's Yuri all right, um Wow That should be Yuri on the left Because we see the stripes and it's always matching the stripes Okay, so it's Yuri on the left and never on the right Oh, wow 2019 ish Now look at the water Amazing shows you the sides of the planets Yep It's enormous look at it. Yeah It's over everything You can see like little bite marks in the water from the stripes, you know Yeah, yeah Then it is on the right don't light blind yourself by looking at the center of the photograph right off Immediately start with the left or the right upper corners and the water And then work your way to the light and then you'll they'll pop right out at you Now go. Oh my god. There's a planet right there. Oh my god. There's a planet right there And it's rounding these planets the same thing again. This is another one Let's see if I can get that date on this one before I stick my foot in my mouth Okay, this says I believe 2018 And in 2018 Yuri would be on the right and seru would be on the left Yeah the 2018 was just about the time that that Yeah, Yuri and attu went over to the right and that's when when Nepecity first started doing her close passes and discharges Is when when Yuri and attu moved over and then behind it was at the time Was nepecity because seru is on the left It and Yuri is the next planet in that rotating arm attu is farther behind it to the right and up Off to the just middle of right corner page and then nepecity is behind Which is that green blob Above the chimney at the horizon on the right hand side between the skyline see that little green blob Oh, yeah, that is nepecity behind Yuri Whoa It's so small in 2018. Yeah. Yeah Wow Yuri is very I mean excuse me nepecity is a very small planet. It's either the size of earth or smaller But she looks very huge when she's doing close passing But I think because of the rotational speed of that axis and the snorkel and the you know in the rain bombs That's what makes me think she's smaller because of how fast that planet rotates Larger planets rotate slower smaller planets rotate faster That would be why it would create a snorkel and that rotational Tornadic like behavior and then the the tornadoes that come off of it And then of course the asteroids underneath the big three and all of that And if you go back and you and you watch some of these supercells where they're calling it Oh, it's a supercell it's a tornado cell and you're actually you can see it the bottom of nepecity You actually find the big three asteroids in the group you automatically know They're foolish and like you are there times when earth is completely dark from the sun being covered up by these planets Um, yes, there have been white outgays and shadowing um, we were um We were showing radar footage for god like five years Where you could actually see the shadowing of the planets go by on the radar Wow Posted and I could never get anyone to even so much as comment on it And so I stopped sharing it regularly. But yeah, we've got we've got numerous going back for years We've got numerous examples of where uh, these planets will cross in front of the In front of the earth will actually cast shadows on them and of course the earth I remember you you gave us a link once and then it wasn't there Just Right. They they also They cut that they cut the sharing of the link. You couldn't share the link after a while. Wow. You could look it up Yeah, I seen that little that that thing going over and you you said look at that Look at that the whatever o'clock Um, and then as I watched it went over america like shadow Yeah, you'd see the shadowing on the face of the earth looking at it from radar And uh next rad and all of that and you would see the shadow But you got to the point after a while they stopped allowing you to share the link because you got you you could open the link But then you got a blank And that happened with usgs as well. You can't share earthquakes Uh, the link you can share the link to the overall site But if you individualize A specific earthquake and try to share that with people they'll get a blank And they'll have to go to the site to look it up for themselves So you don't even get to directly share things anymore Uh, excuse me. I'm uh, it's cop drop time Off drop number one recall uh Yeah, I was just gonna add to rob's question. Um, the internet like it's been scrubbed there used to be videos I was trying to find one just now but uh At least four years ago. China went completely dark. I mean dark three of the afternoon and it was darkest night So It's on it's right And russia had an episode maybe 2019 somewhere in there. Yeah, we had we had it up here in montana. Wow We had it didn't go completely dark. So it's not nearly you try to find the videos They're gone. Yeah, it's very hard to find the videos. Yeah, I mean the last time I looked for them Here's what I had to do Uh, I went to google because youtube tick tock. You can't find anything Um, and if you google it you'll find like articles about it and then in the articles will be a video that's embedded So you can't really save it and share it, you know, but you can screen record it and so yeah, I'll see if I can get that I'll say If you go to bing and then use their search engine, you'll find different information than you will on google Yeah Yeah, I do have more information about me than google does It's weird Sure. Yeah, and you can go to dark dark go as well Um I think I had my video ready. Remember that video was trying to show you all yep Clear skies, let's see if it works this time Oh, wait, let's do this one first. Uh sam can you explain what's happening here? I have people asking Here's like Okay, what's going on? I hope they're not filming through glass. That's my first thing I don't know if they're filming Yeah, but if not Well question is are they filming through their auto window screen? I think I uh saw I think they said they were in a park somewhere Okay, it looks like they're outside like walking their baby or something like that or their child is holding me right now I'm looking at the street. Okay Um boy, that's keeps moving People buy tripods Yeah Definitely Um, they are on your plan man. They are the same size And I'm gonna scream glass double Yeah Now that white dot next to the moon we can talk about that Uh, that could be multiple dots. Yeah. Well, just the one next to the bright Uh center moon Uh, that could easily be that second mini moon That they've told that where it's located Yeah, well, it's you know, I don't I don't know exactly it's gonna orbit It's orbiting along right it fell into synchronous orbit and title orbit lock And we'll be here for 56 days and leave sometime in november or maybe december. I don't I have to relook that up Um, but yeah, right. Was it two months? Yeah, it's it's for 56 days or something like that. But anyway Uh, la la la, uh, yeah, but I you know, the two the the yellow upper left object is very similar in size And looks also like the moon as well. So I'm gonna have to scream glass double So my question would be Like it's not moving it doesn't appear to move around like a Is that what a glass double does? I thought lense flares or whatever moved Yeah, when you have similar sizes that screams And now they don't they don't have the same intensity. So I you know, I can't I can't really work off of the I don't have a lot to work with here But I'm I'm pretty tempted to say glass double Yeah I'm sorry, I you know Especially you know moving around like that and now I do expect that you would jog your camera even if you are filming from a tripod to show people Um, but it's entirely possible. It could be an asteroid, but it just it has a very similar look to the moon face So I I have to scream glass double Now if it had a different facial feature inside that less intense second upper left Circle they would have a different facial expression Then I would have said oh, maybe it is something but it does look like the moon as well. So I'm gonna say glass double Sorry, I hope I don't dash anyone feeling It's okay. No people were asking We have to be we we have to And uh, yeah and buy a tripod Yeah, they're cheap Yeah, they are and don't trip over them for like five Pents up easy I've tripped over a few tripods in my time I'm ready to watch jillian's pictures. You want to see what jillian caught? Yeah, let's pull that up here. Yes Okay, here we go Oh A little shiny nose like riddles Oh Look at that lovely orange Oh, wow You look at that if you turn that upside down that's like a surface But it's our moon. It's like behind our moon. How can something be that big? Because they are It's that big behind our moon. Yeah. Yeah These are very large planets and we are these tiny we're we're this tiny little rock earth We're not even a water type planet. We are a rock type planet and the fact that we're covered in water Is by luck. Yeah, look at that Asteroids Yeah I can't I can't tell where the sun is coming from if I can't tell you which one that is but yeah That could easily be the red out What's the time just to the right of that? Looks like something's coming out of the middle, but then when you look at it, it for a little bit longer you can tell Very cool Yeah, it was just so weird. I couldn't tell if it was like a like a fingerprint or two eyes Okay, and try to see where the light source is coming from the left So there again you have lead asteroid in the upper middle Yeah And that was a satium satium jello moon is what that was this again. Okay now above A dead center would be above would be the bottom of that too That is the side of urie right there with the tan asteroid and the other asteroids to the left of the sun Yeah, my ring doorbells cool Cool, look at that. You're one of them rich people. Huh? You got one of them ring doorbells I don't have any none of that technology You don't have you one then remember no my cave doesn't come with them Up here in my montana cave, you know, well, I got a bear skins and stone knives man. Look at that That of course is the side of a satium satium jello moon That bear is of course the stripes of urie with the asteroids Coming in from the upper left going down to the center You could see the shadow line. Yep. Look at that beautiful Look at that one. Yeah We've asked right at the jello moon and satium all on the right everything else on the left The tim is probably cutting in in the back view here Up just to the left of the upper left of the sun. Yeah, a little grayish different color like circle right there And that is the bottom of atu and atu's moon And again Bottom of atu atu's moon. Yeah, they were active this week. They were so active You know, they're facially illuminated as they go past That's the side of urie cutting over the top of the sun As she transcends in the day And it's overhead it was just right over me it was so cool Look at that I Of course in the background is the side of very side of very very big huge urie and this is the white moon of its of atu right there Yeah, look at that. You can see it. You can see the thing that's getting smaller too It is getting smaller You can see it here again There's the white of atu's moon in front of at purple atu. See purple with the pink edge That pink edge is the side face of atu And then behind it is urie And behind that is seru Which is making the orange glow at the horizon Now it's the bottom of urie right there with atu's moon sticking in and and the bottom of atu and Over and over again they match That is the bottom of urie right there And that asteroid drawing that rebecca again posted a year a while ago. That's a band of asteroids right there whole cluster of them Yeah, look at them at the base cloud of urie like you've seen that over and over and over and over again I've drawn it a hundred times Yeah, it was making the animals Oh, I heard a bird. No, I'm joking Yes, the geese are are more plentiful this year here. We actually saw geese this year. I haven't seen geese in years Which is weird for montana because we normally have a lot of geese And there's some bonkers We're just going bonkers under these great big planets I'm sure that all the animals are feeling it. You know, I mean look at all the sightings If you go if you go to slap tam and you see all the cryptids and dogmen and all the the big foot sightings are Tripling and way way up more and I've granted everybody's got a camera and everybody's out doing that But um, they're they're sightings from animals I'm sure that you know if you were if you were a big foot and you knew the planets were passing because you're you know You're not incorporated by the policy that says gravity. So you I'm sure can see these planets I I can't even imagine what they would be thinking, you know, maybe they have an education who knows Look at the purple. Do big foot has stools and teachers. Who knows? Thank you, wendy. Where do they live? Look how it started to glow just that's no that was tonight I could have sworn you Did you say something about big fit having teachers? Yeah, I said, you know, just big foot have schools and and and and teachers That's what I thought you said. I was like Do you know? Hey class 101, you know 101 Or not Look at this Look at the wishful and ancestral knowledge Oh my gosh, that's the bottom of that. Do after these moon. That's I can't see that Well, you know, I'm sure their parents teach them see that you have nothing but you know alone time. So I bet they home school I bet they home. Yeah, I bet they do too You're a bunch of jubiles Boy That's actually that's these moon right there. This is the center Yeah, you can see the moon. Look. Yeah, you can see the moon And there is the illuminated core of the satan's yellow moon and the lead asteroid Dead center above the bush in the middle of the picture And then we're back over to atu atu's moon, which is beyond The sun behind you the light You see the creators of atu's moon. Wow In the upper right corner They're gray blue Yeah, look at it. It's pretty Yeah And there's a whole wash of whatever's going on in this shot That's too at least In atu's moon Yeah, I like my my wishbone one that that great big purple thing with a wishbone That's atu's moon As it goes beyond earth and becomes spatially illuminated So gorgeous you said they would do this but they're so big Yeah, and now that they're going past the sun We're seeing them spatially illuminated because they are now Beyond earth and into the light for the last few years All we can see was the back sides and the and the sides of them when they were crescent illuminated And then when they were smaller, um, I posted a picture, uh to I believe I gave you a copy rebecca of that 2017 picture that's going around Neal in Anybody else's older picture and I had a copy of that. I still have a copy of that picture, but I just reposted their copy And that shows you I thought it was really good Pointy and picture to show everybody what the planets used to look like Way back when So over seven years ago Let me click on it again and see I Looked but I couldn't even come up with a drawing that far back of December of 2017. I think I'm not sure which one it is. So you sent me a few Let's see. Was it I don't think it's that it's that's no, it's not that one. I can uh, no Maybe I didn't get it because I don't see it in your I God, where did I post it? Let me go back to see where I posted it Grab you a copy of it. I think I posted it on sky watcher one Oh, I yeah, I see it. I see it. I see it. I don't know why it's not there. Let me get it I'll put it there Huh, oh wait, it says there. Sorry guys Here Sorry There it is. That's the one Yeah cool and in this shot Uh, you've got never very large never you on the right in front of that in front of never you is jury An attu and the red dot of course is a satum and the green dot on the other side To the left is nephesity and Uh, you can see that bluish dot and that is matim Oh, wow. Yeah in the early years and then sarah was behind it to the left You can see there's a sort of a green blue open core in the upper left corner Huh, that's but that's back when the you know, the planets were still little and the light was then just shining underneath me Sarah never was on the right sarah was on the left He was in the front right With attu which is in the upper right corner You can see attu that too is moving in the upper right corner of this picture Just tiny small compared to urie which is in front of never And of course the big green and the big red are our nephesity and this atom when they were first coming in and getting bigger and bigger and bigger And I believe the dot is probably the lead asteroid just above to the left of the sun That rounded sort of tan dot is I believe the lead asteroid at the time And the trick is to look at the reflection in the water Oh look there you can see yeah, so nabir nabiru is at the right of vice adam Uh nibiru is way behind is adamis atom is tiny in the shot That's that big orange ish blob nephiru is very large And behind that all that blue area with the see where that green shaft of light goes up on the other hand Of the sun that's the edge of never Okay, there's like a slant is there's a slant going across the top right hand. Yes And that's the light running underneath nibiru and then saru is on the left And nephesity and isatom this is when they were first in 2017 when they were first coming towards them And they were first we were realizing that what before that pictures before that were where nephesity is just a green dot And the satum is a red dot and then matim is a blue dot And then at this point two years later, they're coming closer and bigger and bigger and we realize hey These are much smaller planets in front of the very large planets and two gas giants And yeah, it's it's just it's amazing and like I said before there's so much people have missed So much information. It's it's insane what people have missed And there's no way for us to get all of those back because you know, I'm I lost so many computers and and We I kept them and kept them thinking I was going to get this away to get to those hard drives But I never could because techs aren't free And so eventually I finally I mean I had all these hulk Computers laying around here and I finally just you know smashed them and threw them away Oh Yeah, yeah the money I got rid of when my wife, you know, they tried to evict me here a couple years ago It's going on our second year now And we got through got rid of so much stuff just to be able to move And then to find out that we didn't have to move so I I sold things off I gave things away or just I you know, the house has never been the same I I mean I never redecorated since we were backing up I still have boxes of shit laying around And I'm looking at going where do I put this and it changed the value of everything I own To find out that somebody can just boot you On a limb without concern and it's financial only Yeah, and it's the world we live in it's scary. I've lived here for 22 years. You think I can just move You know wow and they tried to undervalue my house We had been there for 12 years and the guy just said like no you can't stay here anymore You've got to find somewhere to go and that was And that's how I ended up Yeah, well I own the house. I don't own the land Yeah, renting on my lot, you know And he's got a problem with his plumbing and I I need to not say too many things in case somebody would hear this show So I'll just leave it at that. It was kind of callous and it put us through a lot of help And it was very expensive very expensive and even my kids haven't even really recovered from it. They still talk about it anyway Back to the skies Back to the sky. I went and checked my sky Just to see Just to see if there's anything out there. You have a sky. Do you have one? Nothing. Okay. Here's my video though. I re-sent it over. So this is an example of what my skies look like for a month Now I'm Okay, let's sit here. Yeah, I don't know. I'm sad. You must get a break in this guy I I see the yellow moon I like I saw this I did I did very much like this video And remember Rebecca's a professional Right Yeah, don't try this at home Don't drive that fast either Yeah, right So you're uh, your favorite parking lot is it finally a chick play now It's in progress. You can see it right there. They're building it. Yeah. Yeah my favorite spot is uh There's two lots. There's two lots and one of them is all you know So it doesn't matter even if there's an empty lot beside it. There's gonna be all this, you know traffic for people craving chick filet, so I've never had Really wow, they don't have chick filet in vegas I they do. I just never had it. Oh, I see. I got you. Okay. I didn't even know what that is. I mean, obviously chicken Whatever chicken sandwiches basically as their thing but they have everything else, you know chicken whatever so anyway, yeah, they're taking my my Viewing spot away. I'll figure out somewhere else to go. It's tough Being in downtown, you know, it's like they do not many open spots That's perfect like it was that's two blocks from my house Anyway That's yeah, it is a bummer nicole. That's how I feel I've been Yeah, I don't have much of a southwest view at all because we've got a mountain in the way but My my south view is good. If I leave my house And then if I go into missoula, then you can you know, it's a big valley so you can see pretty much everywhere And I do occasionally, you know, just at walmart sit there and do the parking lot 360 and Stand there and go. Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow and people kind of look at me like I'm weird but But then I am weird There is a video. I don't know. I named it random oddities. That's what I put on there Uh, it's just some clips that I have found that I thought were odd. So let's see what they I don't remember what's on it It's been a while It's not all Bottom of urie Yeah, here isn't that grumpy there? Yeah, it's being illuminated and it's after sunset. So that's the bottom of urie being shined on It's in space. So that is what the bottom of urie looks like although it is Thousands of miles away from us. It's so very large That this is what we see and this is a gas giant right next to earth Because excuse me, they don't make Earth does not have clouds like that period Those are not our clouds We're gonna be so lonely when they all go away. What are we gonna do? We might have to start looking at flowers or something or cats Plenty of them cats Well, I see that rebecca has changed her personal page to her her main picture is mittens Yeah Somebody's star of the show she is yeah, somebody who said oh, I'm not keeping this cat. No, no, I'm I'm a god youngest child Right, right I know I was not going to get attached. I was not going to but that is a rocket That is a rocket Yeah spiral don't the the direction change spiral and it's spiraling. So yeah, that's a rocket I That looks like an eye on tail illumination off the bottom of planet that too Oh Wow, look at that. Oh Hey, what's that? Uh, temp is to say city light shining upwards Yeah You know like some grand theater opening we're shining up but it could be could be something else but That looks localized Oh That was weird I always think of like close encounters of the third kind when I see stuff like that, you know, and I You know Well some of these playing with lasers, right? Maybe it's a light show. Yeah. Yeah, I'd say light show I Weird it's flat up top Must be cut off above by something in the way And then the question is is that the red asteroid going in front of the sun? Wow We've seen the lead asteroid going numerous times in front of the sun but right now We know that the red asteroid is predominantly dead center in the middle of our out view So this is entirely possible the red asteroid crossing in front of the sun and it's being chopped off By the top of it. See how the white light green blue Uh, the top of the sun is being visually out view cut off cropped on the top by planet seru Wow, that is crazy. That's a good one in it. Wow nice I haven't seen this one yet either. I hadn't seen pretty surprising like either Usually when something hits like this It's everywhere. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm 87 people posted it. Yeah Yeah, I found this on facebook. I found this on tiktok. I found this on youtube Is I was wondering if that was the ion tail Okay, what did this thing in front of us here? Uh, Nice, well, it'll get back. Oh shoot. Let me go back Sorry guys We'll get there Yeah, uh, scientifically research beginning The beginning of that video i'll pay attention this time Too bad it only stays on it at the moment That See how that's that bitch Yeah, that's a that's a base cloud Oh that could easily be okay. Oh boy That's it lead asteroid right now above the boat Going downward drawing and the ion tail is the white one at the horizon further to the right That's the ion tail right there It's flattening out because it's so close it's so close to our earth atmosphere. It's absolutely flattening out on our upper atmosphere That's the ion It looks flat like that. Yeah, well, let's get squishing into our upper atmosphere And that's why it's flattened and then up to the upper left here is where the lead asteroid is going right there That's the lead asteroid crossing in front of the south and the southeastern jello moon And then you've got the white illumination of the side of urie dead center just above the boat to the left And then the orange back at the horizon again is the bottom of planet saru And urie should be right there Yeah The wishbones there with of course the tan asteroid sticking out after it pan farther left This is the bottom of urie again bubbly bottom of urie So wavy it's like it's like like blood vessels or something gas giant It's got it's got all these gases that are clipped in this is the bottom. Oh boy. Look at the green there You know and hi there in the past city Yeah, the opacity is right there and then at two and at two's moon are to the right But the green is substantially shown I'm very boy. Look at that. That's the red asteroid again. Yeah, we know that one. Oh Hey Sam pretty. Yeah, I just I just now saw this question from wendy and about that Asteroid in front of the sun with a flat on top She is asking how do you know that it was saru? Like is that from a viewing? You know, no because you know where saru is And we know that urie is not cutting off the sun in a straight line Much bigger and is cutting off of the straight line where urie would be cutting in Right, correct Urie would be cutting it at a side angle where saru is could be going to be cutting the top off of it And we know where saru has been and has gotten closer and closer over the last few months So it is basic logic that it has to be saru cutting off the top Okay, there we go Because we know where I just want to say this happened like hours before a horrible earthquake in turkey Like this everybody was talking about this red asteroid, especially the first clip and and the weather channel came along not long afterwards and Made a clip they they said This shape this anomaly was caused by wind Rushing up against the side of a mountain Causing the clouds to create this swirl that was the that was there rebuttal for this Yeah, no against a mountain. That's a red asteroid with little sister the little sister smaller round uh Pocket asteroid in front of very large red asteroid And if you notice how low it is off the deck on the horizon that fits into the chinese picture where at their horizon there's a rounded Shredded drop shaped object in front of the sun and of course it's being cut off and above just like wendy was asking about um this is Well, this is most likely urie over the top which is where the dark area is and the illuminated area is et cetera Yeah Close passing nepesta yet one two three see the bottom rings one two three Close pass nepesta snorkel and rain bomb Okay, everybody have a year's worth of rain wow look at that stuff going We talked about this last week on last show. This is the uh base plate of asatom's yellow moon being illuminated from underneath Oh lovely. Look at that bright yellow bright yellow bright yellow whereas before when we saw nepacity being illuminated at her core Uh, she would of course show the green and then not as intensely bright as this yellow intense bright That is of course in the placement And this is of course as nepacity see the green and there there's nepestee of the drop drop snorkel Yeah, maybe this nepestee Very big very green and she's getting smaller See the open core core smaller Green inside And there are there are people out there they're gonna argue. Oh, that's just a normal tornado. No No Not normal. Look at the rotation that entire thing as far as the eye can see is rotating not just the tornado itself That is the bottom of planet nepestee Making a close pass and she's small and she's a tiny little planet but There again count the ranks one two three And this is why you get these freak storms in these close passes and you get the 120 mile an hour winds And shit like this out of the blue that the radar did not or the weather patterns I saw one of those the other day where they were talking about the the 2020 durejos And and how all those videos are coming out now and they going yeah, none of them It was never predicted on any of the weather patterns and yet there it is boom And this is the discharging. This is where the planets do not crash into each other They electrically repel look at that. Look at that red I Yee look at that I wonder if it's a base cloud close pass from his satum. Look at that. I'd never seen that before Wow sir One two three That's a very angry looking It's nail foot bottom of that two bad twos moon It's like a pixie slipper. Yeah, yep Or a slimy little snail foot And bubbly bubbly look how orange that is that's a satum yellow moon and his satum And the long box cube is in there or something. Well, is that the space tube up close? Wow. Look at that Tube thing. Yeah, is that the space tube park next to the long box ready to take on the commodities before they ship it back home And look at the rotation of this planet Wow That's beautiful That's the bottom of urie God look at that Does it ever fall into darkness? There's an example look the whole everything's dark and it's not sunset yet It's an hour look at this. This is that red stuff we were talking about from europe and from uh from italy and all that They're getting these red skies And that's Well, while the red skies are coming from a direct light refraction off a very red planet his satum Look at that um Yeah, that could be wave clouds of urie or wave clouds of nemesity hard call on that one Somebody's gonna, you know say it's h a a r p. But I don't agree with that Uh, this is the close passing of asteroids at night Yeah, it looks like that last night here Yep, and again, those are those are asteroids underneath at to at to moon at night They're always there Yeah, probably the red asteroids little sister spiral asteroid all in front of at to at to moon at night Whoa And this is an object in the middle And the the two light areas are one light area, but there's something in the way And I don't even know the date of when this was captured Let's see can I find it? Oh, it is not very visible I'm thinking 2021 Yeah, that's about right That was when nepecity was dead center at the time. So this is nepecity in the way of the sun Well And you're seeing the flashing because the rotating planet in front of it and is making the light change And Of course electrical storm There's a storm where nepecity is repelling off the earth Trying to keep it from crashing into each other, but they don't do There's light shining underneath the planet. Oh look how gorgeous up That is beautiful Underneath the bottom of urie again with really weird gaseous formations of of asteroids and bubble It could never be a real sam. Look at it. It looks like that we dog handle bars thing I've seen that coming towards us in south africa like little dog handle bars Things nothing those are not that's not within our atmosphere. This is the atmosphere of a close passing planet And if you look at the sky, there's no clouds on the even on the horizon So that was a double the double rainbow means there's two suns, doesn't it? Yep Hmm Amazing Yeah, I seen that above us during storm ashley as well when larger one smaller I stared these for years and I kept going okay. It's the only reason there's a dark ring in the middle Because normally a rainbow wouldn't do that Now look for your pot of gold indeed I see we've lost rebecca. I see we've lost uh Christopher, yeah We're all alone sam Oh, i'm used to it Oh, she's back I'm here. I had to take care of what my son brought me something to eat. I'm lucky you so I had he was like taste it taste it But I have to somebody cook for me. Somebody should come and bring me something. Oh man I know they're taking such good care of me. They really do Cut off halo Not a sundog Okay, you made me hungry now because now i'm thinking about my stomach again. I know he did a good job He made roasts and baked potatoes. So Yep making roasts very important I don't know what to do He's a good cook really Oh boy look at this that I i'm still trying to define that in my brain that light cut off angle Because that thing Wow That of course is that's a blocked but cumulus nimbus cloud is creating that that's a shadow off the cloud Okay That rising cumulus nimbus in the background. That's normal Normal, okay, normal Normal normal. Yeah, that's normal. Okay. Yeah, that's normal Although the planet behind it isn't but There's not an effect of the planet doesn't affect that that rising cumulus nimbus cloud Now here again another another example of lead asteroid yellow. Uh, this after mjellamoon and this after Turning all red and cool after sundown And they're looking in the northwest sky And what's cool is those darker deeper blues showing, you know illumination of a planet and I just it's amazing And this is not in any way shape or form our normal skies And everybody has just so grown so accustomed to you know Going back to the years when we were having purple Everybody's And then they all went oh it's A R P, you know And that's what they'll say about this as well. What's the aeronautics? Parting that well, it's possible that some of the solar flaring will do that but not this This is the close pass and very very cold planet coming in and creating A durejo as they call it now or a push storm as a close pass occurs This again is the uh Let me see where I'm trying to figure out where the light is coming from on this shot It's stalled did you have a pause? Uh, oh, that's ended that was it. Oh, okay. All right hammer. Yeah I was reading all the comments. I like Dave is lucky. David has some of these videos Huh, who I said, Dave was lucky. He gets he says I smell my supper getting made for me. Oh nice. Yeah For me for once I hope that be not.

They would uh There is so much msg and you wouldn't believe One of the major ingredients And it's good it's yummy, but it is not healthy for you And it sort of freaks your mind into wanting to eat more You know just you know Doritos has msg as well and that tricks your mouth into wanting more and you'll sit there and eat your bag in Doritos I just Man or or nacho cheese Doritos. Oh and when I was a teenager hell, you know, that was a meal, you know A couple of coaks and a whole bag of Doritos. No problem People dip Doritos in dips and stuff.

Okay Hmm It was puppy Wow, it's looking pretty wild. There's like some Yes Something's right about the bed. What was happening too? Look at how it's spreading out like something's smack right on top Uh-huh and then there's something definitely passing like way overhead Look at that you can see it. Yeah Do you guys see this like rainbow prism right here? picture I see a whole lot of ion draggy things. Yeah I'm uh getting signal that I'm being cut off You sound better Yeah, I uh my my picture stalled it's uh, it's locked up Wow Uh send it my way chrissiper send it to oklahoma. Okay. Yes. I know right I'm ready But tomorrow I gotta be available to go out and mess with it Uh, well, yeah I'm wondering where Rebecca's been on her lives on tiktok and that's the reason why I know That's why it's that's why There's nothing to see Is that the long box cube? Right go to your left a little bit. All right. All right. There's a shadow. I see it right there I'll get away from the trees in a second. Is that the long box cube sitting there? I think so Like the part and then yeah, you see this iridescent like yeah, yeah, that's that's gotta be the butt end of the long box cubes Oh my god, look at that thing Yeah, I see it Intergalactic very massive massive craft you guys it's there It's here By the way, et is here brothers and sisters boys and girls men women and ducks um Et's park here has been for quite a few years now. We are not alone That ever asked question. Are we alone and there they are That you're seeing the dark end the shadowed end of a very long Long box very massive ship that they park star destroyers on inside of by the hundreds So it shows you how huge that thing is And that is the square backside of the rest of it and it's angling down away from us Wow, that's why it's as bright as it is on that middle edge because the sun is shining off the middle edge Of the top just looks like the end of a school bus right, right The end exactly the end of a school bus Wow Only what school are we going to? Man, thanks school. This is incredible big school Uh It gets a little old I don't want everybody cube right there. Look right there to the left of the sun. There's just there's a square Like immediately to the left A bunch of things are so they were right next to each other. Holy shit. Yes. Sorry. There's there's a there's a big Star destroyer right there too I believe you This is fun. Yes. Oh boy That's so obvious Oh my gosh, that's crazy and I don't know. I have sunglasses on and You know, whatever tint is in the glasses totally, uh Blocks out it causes you to see multiple different shades of blue It's just wild out here And it's changed so fast look out how everything dark blue versus the horizon gray Right, right and that's all planets above the sun that are overhead top of us. That's the site of urie right there Yep, and the tan asteroid is the big dark spot Wow very big And that's the bottom of atu and atu's moon above the sun And the cube is there and I'm wondering right crystal just directly above the sun. Is that the tiny skull asteroids sitting there? Uh, I'm so glad I can barely tell. So there's a straight line straight above the sun Yeah, and at the top of that little short straight line, it looks like the the skull asteroid. Wow But small oddly small Yeah, I'll have to look at the I could be later because I can't I can't see it Yeah, I don't imagine you can yeah, it's pretty bright anything stirring at the sun anything above it and below it And beside it is it going to be hard to look at Uh, here's here's I just want to show this really quick So people have a visual of site of this atu we're looking at uh-huh This is the drawing that goes with what chris is seeing right now And on the out view if atu's over the top of our heads and as satum is coming in in our faces and going over the top of our heads Our out view these two will be parked right next to each other And they literally are and of course that's what a bonds picture was showing earlier as well Because they're so close to our out view So Wow And they are real and they are there Yeah And we saw the texas cube arrived. We saw the long box cube arrived. We saw the empire orab arrive We watched when all of a sudden there was space tubes being cited around the world So, you know, they are here. They are here. They are you know, it's like the horton hears a who We are here. We are here. But you know, these are big ships with lots and lots of extraterrestrials intergalactic craft that have been here for years to prove and to collect the commodities from planet earth That we give out every 3,654 years And you don't want to know the rest of the You couldn't see the the blue has such a curve to it too. Yeah That's gotta be at two's moon in front of you guys probably in front of an opacity but And you're Okay, but yeah, I'm saying is they're all right there. Yeah. Yeah All around the sun both sides and and straight up Yes, look how much the texas cube has changed since rebecca saw it first Yep, you can totally see it now. Wow Ah boy Wave at him Oh shoot Wow, uh terra. Yes, I do too Oh Boy, yeah, it doesn't change much but week after week after week just small variations as time goes by Wow And we are not making this stuff up. We're not imagining this We're not coming up with all of this and you know, the reason it's called the texas cube is because it arrived over texas The reason it's called the long box cube was because a few years later a longer long box cube showed up And we've been citing these things for a decade now I watched them when they were out in deep space On their way and then boom they got here through a wormhole Oh boy, all right, so they're not the same faction as the people from from nibiru and seru. They're different factions There's lots of visitors here right now It's one thing if they look like us But what happens when you see one that doesn't look like us is it gonna be just too Well, it's well. Yeah, I could be um, I the the guy I you know, uh, the grays are hard to deal with The lizard people are really cool But scary they're charismatic as hell and the pleidian is of course was Far easier to deal with except I kept trying to look at the back of his head and everything because it was weird It grabs you but eventually over over, you know Period of time you sort of get used to it and the trick is not to have any prejudices because boy, they'll know it in a heartbeat And if you are a prejudice person, they probably won't want you to talk to you Or give you the time of day, they'll just treat you like you're an animal and you like you're one of those stupid humans So why bother or gee? I don't want to mess with time or or inform these people anything. Yeah, I see the side orb and everything on that Wow Yeah, kind of boxy right there dead center in front of attu and attu's moon Really really a lot going on right there in that shot Yeah Over and over and over and over again you're in you're out and People have got to learn what you know, these are not just clouds. There's a whole definition to them. This is why I do the monthly site drawing So everybody gets the opportunity To uh, but we're in between slides. Isn't this normal? You know like like back in school when they you know the slide projector or the end of the video But it did did did did did did did did did did did did did did did start flapping around the reel I there we're back I think one of those things that operate. No, I can't see you. You're a black dog and just Why? Huh, okay, uh Why hang on well, I'll be back. Okay Okay Wow, we are suffering technical difficulties. Please stand by I got my ears are ringing. I can almost talk I'm gonna give you the wave of ringing ears. Wow All I want to do is eat today Yeah Yeah, I feel you jillian Sorry, I keep stuffing shit in my mouth now I It is sam's fault. Yeah, I know right not you doing the crisps I know it's like uh, now I have an excuse to drink soda Yep Oh, I I paid for last week's show. I only had two coats but all I was going for afterwards. It was amazing It was hilarious, but amazing Right me and carbonation don't get along too well I'm probably why I stopped drinking coax years ago. You know, I only added At work, you know, you pour a little bit of a coke. You don't drink a whole one That is not your beer in yours either You know, the notes get it make you have pain or stomach issues and Then you have it and then two days later you're drinking it again. So yeah. Oh, yeah You know, you got a problem win right You might be in a fault. Oh, I'm joking I can't see can you see chris? I don't know. I see it. I see his hand Oh, I'm just I don't see anything. That's I'm not I don't see anything not having too much luck tonight shame His his square is totally blank. Oh, I see I see this guy that he's pointing the picture at really Oh And we see some smaller Stuff going around in there. Yeah, that's wild. I mean the cube is just Yep, definitely you can see it And then the long box cube Oh It's just wild It's getting better and better You know, can you imagine if we're supposed to go actually go viral? I know wouldn't that be fun? Oh god, it would be amazing. You know, we you know, of course with a number one purveyor of this information publicly and Of course, you know, there'd be 87 wannabes that would try to go around us, which is okay, which is hilarious, but Because no one can touch our information Yeah They can know it's nice Then they'll go welcome. You didn't tell us 10 years ago. You know, right? I've been screaming it for 14 And I'm the crazy one And then there, you know, I would love to be a foyer on a wall to watch all those guys He'd grow, you know that laughed at us and And made videos about how crazy we were the most outrageous theory yet That from that Dan guy I love that show. It was just it was My god You loved it Yeah, it was you know, you know, he made us sound like we were absolutely out of our mind And meanwhile we got, you know, a decade's worth of information by that time and And here he's pumping out and you know, all press is good press And how many people did he send to actually maybe check up our background information? I don't know Maybe maybe I mean right you're right Is good press because they're still thinking about you that you still are on their mind You know, they're putting their thoughts and energy into you Right, so it's it's Renting their head as they say Look at michael jackson They were making all sorts of claims about him for viewers You're right. No all press is good press Meanwhile he's going copies of his album and making money. Yeah, right? Because you're at least you're relevant if they're talking about you you're relevant. See right shoot and uh They're sorry go ahead chris. I was just saying anybody can you know write an article about me saying I live in a hyperbaric chamber or something like that right Show y'all. Can you imagine being on the cube with all those space clouds coming off the side of the cube because the sun is shining on it And looking down on earth and seeing us scramble around in our cars and our little rocket ships going up, you know and and I wonder what they think. I wonder what they think Wow It's huge. Yeah, it is massive massive I I sat for you know like a year ago for a couple hours and watched one of them just float by with no clouds around it whatsoever And i'm looking at the infrastructure and all the building construction of it You know the rivets and and you know the tiny ships flying around it in the big old side orb and you know Completely clear of any real cloud whatsoever around it And I watched it for well over an hour and then like even a year ago I I sat there and talked to people about Right before the show I sat and watched the long box cube and numerous triangular Star destroyers go right over the top of my head Well, my neighbors were standing there and watching it with me and their attention span lasted probably about two minutes And but I sat out there for so long that I couldn't even look up any more Like I said before I had lean against the car because my neck got so sore Yeah, I watched these things go over the top of us and it's just amazing And they're square and there's these big huge ass ships And and without the clouds you can absolutely actually you know, you can see that they were Constructs they were built out of these huge plates of this and skirters of that And with a long box cube you can actually see inside some of the infrastructure Where the Texas cube is actually boxed in completely boxed in with rivets and plates everywhere You can't see inside but on the long box you can see inside some of the areas So that's like a giant hangar Well, it's like anytime you've ever seen Star Trek and the Borg ships You know, they're they've got hollow structures where you can fly inside and unbelievable And just massive massive ships They're beyond your wildest dreams how big these things are Yeah, they're definitely there too Yeah, I see a bunch of them right now Well, what blows me away is that people on earth should know that we have this collective pardon the expression invasion force Uh, they don't have to invade they just you just threaten our our our governments and let them know and show them examples of how high advanced their technology is compared to ours And we don't stand a ghost of a chance to argue with them. So this is of course why it's not becoming public Well, I what blows my mind is this sky is over almost three million people right now what Why is you know, we know why it's not on the news or anything, but this is incredible I Yeah, I don't get well, you know, uh the 5 p.m. Or your time probably right you're in the same time I don't know what time it is right now. Okay. Well, it's 506 mountain time here. I don't know if you're in mountain time or not Two hours ahead of me. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Uh, hey be cope Cope Uh, he's here. Um, nice to see you. Um, yeah, anyway, but at this time of day people rushing home. They're trying to get dinner You're watching the five o'clock news And sitting down and they're not outside looking around Right, I think dinner to wait Yeah, yeah, well look what you're getting. I mean, you know, that's the cube right there. I mean you can't argue with it That dark blue thing right there. It's big Hello, Brandon Uh, we had a tired week all of us some of us didn't feel really tired to Hold on Me uh, julian and I both had a spell with headache issues like I was very sick going up and never migraine It was just a I had a nasty headache last night I'd want three days. Yeah Three days man. Wow It was terrible. That's very edge. The sunlight is shining on it And it's it's putting off clouds because it's warming up and it's out there in space Floating around inside of atri's moon and all of those little asteroids that are they're floating in between There's the edge of that to find out Dance Little little Sorry, clouds patterns are massive right now compared to what we first started seeing at you in 2014 and 15 now They're huge Just amazing It's unbelievable You should almost pan back a little bit so we can see more Like what this way? Yeah, well, no, I mean pan is in make the shot Draw back up any on your video. Are you pulling back as far as you can go? Oh, I think that's about it, right? Yeah, so you're not zoomed in I see So now you can wave because they're right over the top of you, right? Yeah Wow, oh, could you imagine? I think I'll probably come back like around sunset We'll see what happens. Okay. It just gets crazy out here during sunset Yeah Let's see what time it is uh four or five It's about five four o'clock So you're two hours ahead. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I get it. Uh, that's great. I think about 6 30 right now Yeah, we'll come back out see how what happens I can't wait. All right. Well Let's go be suspenseful. Okay Somebody landing down putting on a crap you jiggle up in your little Lander, which is the discs ones with the windows. Yeah, and you go flying up there and land on the ship and kick It would take you days to walk around on those things They're they're that big Yeah, I don't think you could even tour the entire thing. It's like trying to walk the pyramids It's like the state of uh, california flying over your head. Yeah They're huge huge Oh, wow, you know look how big a star destroyer is and they park, you know Dozens if not 50 star destroyers to 100 star destroyers on the decks of those things And then they send them through wormholes in the space and then they offload once they get to where they're going They offload these star destroyers, which I watched them do in april of 2019 by eye for hours And that was the first time that we knew that they came out of hiding Because that's when all of a sudden they started Burping off all of these, you know, here comes another star destroyer out of it and another star destroyer And oh look, there's a smaller supports craft and oh look, there's a fighter Fighter craft docking station. We saw all of these and of course I drew some pictures back then And you know fighter craft docking stations. No kidding Just like star wars the movie just like star wars the cartoons It's freaky And it's like well, why was this information given it to us the way it was is because some of this information is necessary Some people they want to know other people they don't want to know So, I mean it depends on point of view. It's they I mean who is they I hate using that term the they But it's it's a big it's a big rat's nest of strings that are all tied together even though there's more factions than one And there's multiple factions on earth from from the masons to the temple or knights to the church to the countries to sweden You know the special forces of sweden. I don't know I mean, there's just numerous numerous earth factions and then there's numerous numerous space factions And then I'm sure that there are multiple factions that live on the nibburu and the and the seru as well So, I mean it's it's immense. What's really going on and taking place It seems like where we are just the most sheltered Bees out there You know what I mean? Like they all probably know everything and here we are just like in a truman show Scenario, you know, we don't really know what is out there We're just in our own little world our own little, you know Uh, yeah, I'm busy wondering whether or not I can afford a prod a handbag or or excuse me That's a tommy hillfinger belter or my way pair of glasses or all I want to drive a lamborghini or hey, um, I want a condo On the beach to the media media That's why it's very much the tv commercials on youtube nowadays and I don't even know what the hell they're trying to sell me It's not even the same uh Advertising field anymore. It's like somebody pulled me plucked me up and stuck me on a planet. I don't understand It really feels like that of course. I have been hiding for quite a while So it's entirely possible that it's me not them but From my cave up here in montana. Yeah, I see Something we were talking about a minute ago was how if they're talking about you even, you know, negatively They're still talking about you. It reminded me it reminded me of these articles. I found talking about my Yeah, what happened? Yeah. Now look at this now this has 331,000 followers and There you know people are trying to claim there's two sons and it goes on to talk about uh My facebook group look at that. This is back in april Yay I mean we're hitting the bigger media Target, you know, so there's that group. Okay, and then here's another channel bro. Bible 1.1 million followers and Recall on his names Whatever. Oh, I was confused. Here's the name of the group again. Look at that. I mean No, there's no you talk about Yeah, well, and then this just hope we go by 22 22 million followers in this particular publication And here we go again Incredibly Desperate they're desperate And here we are again. So see I mean we are getting into the bigger media They would not talk about this if they weren't concerned that we were getting out there Sun halos that's a well, that's a scientific term if I ever tripped over one Oh, you poor sad folks out there I hope that you all get on board with us because we you know, we're not guessing We have been watching this guy, you know, I mean, okay explain go back to 2011 explain to me why the sun came up in the northeast sky Explain that just start there because you can't Because the second star got here from below us underneath 2009 2010 2011 It was visible in the northern hemisphere And in the northeast sky which outshined our smaller dwarf yellow soul Which is due east and then over time all the way up to 2012 They joined proximity and then we had the 2012 back below CMEs and you can look all of this stuff up on google or bing Or free So go do your homework check this information prove me wrong. I dare you Please go try Go try And then we watched the planets for a decade since and so the we know these planets are real We've been watching them get bigger. We've done drawings of them. We know where they are where they're in Yeah, that big blue thing you're looking at is a planet the original sky color is orange yellow Everything above the orange yellow is a close passing planet It's not simple way bigger than your brain can handle. I understand that Way bigger than my brain can handle But we took the time to learn all this information to share it with you so that you would be informed And we're not trying to sell it to you either although donations are greatly accepted and very much needed Speaking of which, you know, I'm not even living at the at the previous donation amount that we used to get and we're going to have a fundraiser For Christmas and please folks out there do not disappoint my children because that's once a year thing that we do actually ask for Is that folks start thinking about Christmas right around? Halloween and uh, I'd like to get a nice package together for my children because Uh doing this takes up all the spare money that we have and we don't have a lot. We live off of you know fixed income Uh, so keep those cards and letters and donations coming in people And of course we'll we'll give you the opportunity to see where to send those through later Where are we on videos? Uh, let's see um well I have a video for alexander I I don't see him here today, but we can still play his video of course So you want to do that? Yeah, sure works for me. Um, otherwise I mean there's we have options. So I have something for hey zoo and he's going to be here today I don't know when but he said he would definitely be here So don't hurry if you're listening to the show a zoo strives safely and carefully. Yeah, for sure. Um Yeah, let's do alexander's video here and while while we're talking about shout outs. I hope jason uh from lolo, uh Uh truck stop is watching again. He said he was gonna try and watch our show again this week and uh, let's hope he did get Do that. Yeah, no way you got his shout out again Wow, look at that That Feature where you see it just pan around like that. I see that's oh boy. I love it when it does that I don't know which planet that is it's a planet rotating. It's like something is Right. Yeah rotating Bottom of the planet and you can see the light change. Is it rounds that big ball? Is it solid? I'm fine. My screen is stalled Yep Is it stalled for you guys? Yeah, I'm stalled. Yeah, I'm stalled. Yeah, I stop Huh, we're fine. I won't play it. Yeah, you know, we gotta we have to difficulties have to I know it's not even halfway through. Okay. Let's get alexander's video here We'll see what happened in germany this week Uh, let's see Find it Don't say it's the path. I was just reading that package trying to figure out what it said. Huh, sorry Hollings, okay Huh Weird, I don't see it. I'll have to get it again I'll get it again. Here is uh some pictures though from carol an Carolina, so I have a little Little slideshow Weeks she's been busy lady They're creating something that is absolutely amazing So clever And it was her birthday. Look the dragon with his mouth open That of course is the bottom of at two at two's moon and of course the the texas cube is in there That's probably the side orb Doing or the spiral it looks like the spiral asteroid because it is dead center That's going vertically away from us Yeah, this is at two at two's moon See Yep over the top of this dead center now and very very prominently in our face Right now and it's just Um, that's why you know, we've been seeing the purple again, which has been really cool I No, no, it's come on. Yeah, that looks like the spiral turning So is this old is this 2021 I'm looking at I this is from this week I okay. Is your thing is he shared this? Oh, sorry. That's it carolin is this week I what up see what the date is. I'm confused. Sorry No worries. She's just shared it in my career. That is the den asteroid that center And there's again up into the upper circle left of top of the picture. That's the den asteroid as well in front of the side of urie And this is the salamander asteroid group coming in our face. It's just at us Audrey This is of course on the right hand side so this would be the bottom of the set the messa jello moon and possibly the long box Keeps somewhere in there. We know it's there back again. That's the circle in the middle is the den asteroid Mostly normal clouds Now look over at the right hand or the left hand side of the sun that is probably matim cutting into the left hand side of the sun I do believe load you balloon you made it Better late than never And again this that's in jello moon Very dark blue area big circular moon Yep at two at these moon deaths that are mostly left And Again that underneath is that white illumination there's a spiral spinning cloud in the upper left And I believe that's where it's bank turning right there that spiral is now it started going underneath vertically away from us Under at two at two's moon and somewhere in there is the cube And I believe my daughters are probably going to be heating up the old pizza oven here pretty quick Yeah, look at that cut in of the light On the left the light is being cut into on the left and on the right That's why that shaft of light is there And My oldest daughter's having a minor coronary playing uh playstation five I don't know if you guys can hear a bit background No You know, I like screaming Intense, I know They're having fun as usual. Yeah, that's cool. They've been pretty good about even going offline sometimes when I stall out really bad They'll go offline enough to sit and find other things to do and give me this Little sad dirty looks, you know, they've actually been pretty good about it Like dad we can't be online because you are as I go. Okay When a for this once a week, right? It's just one one day away, right? Yeah, to them. It's never any Well, is this 85 or 86? 85 Okay. Yeah, I was actually right today because I told I said to show 85 Two more and we break Sam's record. I can't say for sure. I mean, I know we started in October of last year So we're at least 52 weeks Um straight every Saturday, you know, we did a lot of Tuesday nights, but every Saturday for 52 weeks Yeah, we were doing two shows a week for a while there which almost killed all of us 30 shows were Tuesday nights And 50 were support for Saturdays. Oh, and you know, I spent all week long Prepping for the next show and by the time we got done with the last Show after show. Yeah, right. We were just so excited. We wanted to do two show. We couldn't get enough of it So, right, I mean, but some of us do nine and ten hour long shows now. I mean, there's just no way Or or I might say some of my most favorite shows were the Tuesday night shows I don't know why I just there was something about Nighttime I don't know. Yeah, we were in different moods to me. It was a whole different vibe. It was I liked it We'll have to do a night show at least You know a few times a year We could do that one throw in one extra show. I don't know Maybe not I thought it was fun, but it is more work. Mm-hmm. I know it's fun, but it's a lot of work Right, I mean you guys must have felt like your brains were burning up Well, I have uh during that period of time I wasn't sleeping at all and I've spent a bunch of time trying to catch up on some sleep That I missed, you know in the early part of this spring And so my sleep schedule still screwed up I got up at three o'clock in the morning again last night And then I kept having to force myself to go back to sleep by five a.m. And then by eight a.m. I was going Okay, and drag my And uh, I got a chuckle and I literally the other day I spent so much time on the computer that I got into zombie mode again and bombed everybody with music again But I actually fell asleep at the computer, which I'm going to try not to do anymore. Apparently my chair is very comfortable Uh, so it you know got a comfortable cherry and I'm doing the after dinner fall of sleeps, which has only happened a few times And it's not scary to have that happen Anyway, here's a way that you can send a donation to Rebecca On a cash app venmo or paypal or if you want to send a small donation my direction or a large one for that matter Uh, you can write me. I'll add you take personal checks money orders cash Whatever whatever you're safe or comfortable sending to you p.o. Box 6 25 lolo montana five nine eight four seven And I'll thank you in advance and we do we do really we do really need your donations to keep going please please please please Okay, we have um hundreds or thousands of people that follow this information and maybe five people consistently five people Right Yeah, we're not making any money off this. It's really rare that we get donations anymore, and they've dropped off this which is very very and uh Because I didn't mind I put so but I mean listen for since 2017 till this year 2014 I never asked for anything. I never asked for any money I put all of the money into it myself every year every month. I was putting in over hundred dollars Of all the fees. Yeah, I didn't mind. I looked at it as my hobby. It was fine, and I did it No big deal. Now. It's a big deal. It's been a big deal for a few months now Yeah, it's like my whole world has flipped upside down and I'm just saying I I can't really afford it like I could for And so thank you. Thank you This is made possible from viewers like you you guys have to you guys have to you know Help this lady out because she works hard And then so do I you know right right this letter you get one back It really is a lot of work. It really has been days just getting ready for this show There's days I spent six to eight hours in front of the computer And then there's days I just I don't even turn it on I walk away going. I'm not doing it today Right. I mean we're sitting there compiling it put it together and making it make sense for people and making it understandable It's like, you know, I don't know If you appreciate this information, please consider, you know, um, I'm one of those people that when somebody asks for help Um, I I send people money on cash happen stuff I'll send two or three dollars because I know if enough people do that you know, we'll um That person will be better off, right? So I think people just think they don't have the money But if you you do you do have two or three dollars You know, it's like so If you did that once a month or you know, we get five or six hundred views per show if everybody just sent a dollar You know, I mean that would just make the biggest difference in the world guys It's so doable If I had if I had every one of my members on on on Montana sky watcher one and two If I had every one of those members of the two sites that I work on every day plus not including all the other sister sites If every one of those members sent me one dollar a piece I wouldn't have to ask for a donation for two years I know You know, we would have enough extra income that I could actually go out and I keep trying to save for that camera I want I want like a gopro actually want to I want a uh 360 Back up again, but it's it's very expensive and the one I was wanting was because it was plastered Plastic encased and I wouldn't fry it because I have bought five cameras already and I'm on my 15th computer And rebecca and I both spent a small fortune Over the last decade paying for internet to provide all this information for you So, uh drop us a card and you'll get one back Thank you to christopher He hurt us. Yeah, he hurt us So see what I mean a dollar 99. It's like that doesn't faze most people. I mean even me I'm still handing money out and I have you know a few dollars left after I do it. I don't know It's okay. You know what? I mean my name. I bought Up today. I bought two candy bars for my kids And they were the giant chocolate, you know her she's chocolate because we you know get the good pure stuff But those things were three bucks a piece Yeah, so if you can afford a candy bar, you know throw throw three dollars our direction throw five dollars or ten or 200 or whatever you can afford and I know They were all suffering from financial because boy. I mean my a bottle of sauce is seven dollars. So Um, you know ketchup is running five now. It's scary Mustard is Yellow mustard is still really cheap. Um Oh and by the way, don't forget the mcdonald's hamburgers scare ecoli That boiled down to don't eat any onions from Idaho Right now people if you have them in your home Throw them away There's a lot of people getting sick and actually dying from this ecoli in onions Yeah, so check your onion sources. Maybe just not buy them for a while And you know, I think mcdonald's gonna get really hurt Because they right after they had a visitation from a political candidate Then immediately after that they have a quarter pound or ecoli scam where people are getting sick and dying all over the country From mcdonald's hamburgers from the onions on there And they boiled it down the ingredients. They didn't think it was neat, but they did find out it was from the onions But you don't want to know know what's the rest of you know, you wouldn't want to know what's inside of a quarter pound patty I don't think most of our listeners go to mcdonald's Well, if they're part they don't Maybe You know, we do burger king Uh-huh You get burger king here Yeah, we drove to town and they shorted shorted another sandwich. So I only another Expensive hamburger again And those things I mean, I used to be able to take the kids there for 25 dollars. Now we're looking at 40 So it's that is rare. We don't we don't we don't get to do what we used to do Hopefully our economy will turn around I'm sorry guys, but I might have to go to bed because I think I honestly will fall asleep The headache has suddenly stopped being ready And I really am tired I know Go to bed jillian. Yeah Sorry, I forgot. Yeah, it's 20 30. I'll do one listen to you guys. No problem. Okay. Okay It goes by so fast Well, keep telling nice bedtime stories and I'll be able to sort of doze off. Okay.

Let's show alexander's video So we can see what germany looks like this week. It'll let me I think I have it ready this time It looks good. So here we go Hey It's locking up on me, I don't know if it's moving forward Yeah I could be just what I'm you know, sometimes it's a stall for me Mine's been doing that too Locking up. Mm-hmm I like the music Remember look at the dark areas first there's a light cut in coming in off the right That is the red asteroid going horizontally from upper right to lower left. Wow. Look at that In front of at these moon We are seeing direction of the asteroids moving in ways we have never seen them before they are coming from the upper right And going leftward. Wow That's interesting That's unusual I would bet money that is long box cube related. I bet that's the side orb with a drag-off cloud Really? Yeah, and then you can't see the long box because it's hidden in the shadow But I bet that's that little circular cloud with the tail off it is off the side orb off the long box cube That's the base cloud of urie Normal Some of them got asteroids in there as well. This is the side of urie You can sort of see the white face of it right there Cutting in and being illuminated on the left hand side is the white face Right there on the left hand side of the sun. It should be where my tim is Somewhere right in there should be my tim that should be my tim right there. He's focusing on And of course he's now he's getting to the small stone Which we can't identify because there's so much okay that dark blue area right there is urie that main stripe is urie stripe Notice the dark blue on the left and the light blue on the right The light blue is the normal the dark blue is the side of a planet that's being shadowed. You're looking at the back shadow of that's why it's darker I wonder what he has there that the moon has been sighted next to the sun recently During the day and at sunset so be prepared for that. But I thought it was on the right hand side That would be where the side of urie would be right there. That's why it's dark right there is urie dark dark dark area at sunset. That's urie Okay, remember that at sunset the sunset's in the west therefore this is the southwest And then the red asteroid is dead center and the tan asteroid of course is on the on the slightly left of sun Underneath urie and those are the stripes urie and that I don't even know what that is That could be one of the normal planets Our regular normal planets It was moving pretty fast, but I don't know. Yeah, it was Kind of keeps going and moves. Yeah, there are we've got on the other side of the sun in our out view We've got four normal planets are actually more than that, but um They are Remember to keep Information where the normal planets are and they're small they're tiny compared to everything we're looking at That could even be the moon for all I know Sure doesn't look like it though If I would have a crazy educated guess I would say blue asteroid because it kind of looks like the central dot of the blue Asteroid, but I don't quote me on it Yeah, that really does look like the blue asteroid even though it's not the great color It has a dot in the middle. Yeah Okay, they shall dot in the middle that we've come to know Yes, I see And it's definitely not the comet because there's no tail behind it And there isn't anything small like that around other than the spiral asteroid and a few hundred other ones which we haven't really catalogued and identified, but um Yeah It's very intensely bright And tumbling Asteroid makes sense. Yeah. Yeah And bright like that. Wow Yeah shimmering It's rolling Tumbling hot That's hot Well, it's not what it is. It's sunlight shining Underneath after sunset and it's being illuminated because it's semi-closed okay I don't know. I have no idea Yeah, look where look where it is off the deck Oh Thank you Andrea headache remedy I never get headaches, but I sure had one last week Now I have found a product on the market within the last few years that if your stomach can handle it The excedrin for migraines really works quickly Really? Yeah, they're hard to find I don't people will buy them up off the shelf. They'll empty the shelf to get them like on a scale of one to ten It was a 12. It was just all I could do is put a little covers over my head and try to sleep Well, now were you drinking red wine or having any other sulfides or nitrates? No Did you have a different dietary thing that you normally do? No, was your back out? Were you sitting screwy on the couch? I Know why it happened. Oh pressure. Yeah Emotional pressure Yeah, okay. Okay mom. I'm sorry. You're still going to be some of that I'm still dealing with my uh family loss. We hear we just lost a family member recently She passed away on and on and it yeah, I you know, I thought that I'd be better by now, but I'm not Right, sorry It's tough isn't it? Yeah, it's not It's not but it's doing you know, it's like you got to be kidding me Really? Right. Oh shit. Yeah Yeah, even the kids have uh Uh started speaking a little bit more about it. Originally they didn't say much at all. I guess Doctor And now they're of course talking about it now now now they're actually more emotional about it than they were I guess of course right shock and now they're getting emotional about it But you guys you know, you got the stages have to go through the stages There's like five of them Yeah, I ever wonder why that you know, here's the sun being blocked out by the light The planets are blocking the sun and it's way early for sunset and yet there's no light All right, Andrea, I agree. Andrea's totally right cannabis. Oh Tara, thank you. Um Yeah, it's it's not so much the loss as it is a shock Uh, we already pretty much lost her but then we really lost her and there's no recourse for any of the unsolved issues Yeah Yeah, that moon I tell you I wish I had a camera that could do that I know it's fancy equipment. I said that off the cup. I wasn't asking actually asking for anything. I was just saying Yeah, I wish I had a camera He's a professional line. Look at that line. I've never seen that line before on the moon So obviously rain the mountains of some sort or did something roll, you know rolled off the ball, which of course it wouldn't do That is so cool Big old tiny chunk of rock that was rounded stellar rounding Oh, I watched okay on on on flat earthers Uh, that they were in the legal system because they were Flat earthers. They were also sob citizens sovereign citizen. That was just like I I laughed through that whole episode I was just going. Oh my god. The shit you buy into And you know, we don't have a flat earth and there is no such thing as a sovereign citizen And you have the right to travel but not a right to drive a car when you don't even get me started on that Oh, you don't agree on Oh, well, you know The premise behind it was written in the 1800s and 1700s And so yet they're trying to they're trying to Bring that forward into set of rules for 2024 and of course it doesn't work. Yeah, you have a right to travel You can walk anywhere you want for free and they can't stop you You can walk from one state to the other if you choose But driving a car That is a licensed vehicle That you have to pay and have insurance for and all of these rules that mandate all of this stuff And the city laws and traffic laws county and state and all of that have to be followed So this is of course where the sovereign citizens get into Saying in a court while you have no jurisdiction over me, but yes, you do If you are walking then they don't But if you're driving a motor vehicle that has to be licensed and registered and insured Then you do you can't pick and choose the rules. Either follow them or you don't And that's enough political five minutes of jargon. Let's go back to whatever I guess what Guess what I see people in our green room So we're not alone zan. We're not alone anymore. I see christopher is back and hey zoos is ready. So I'm at it. Let them talk for a while. Yeah Here's christopher. Hey, he made it back. You got a nice sunburn So you look kind of red but yeah, all right in here Yeah, well and here is hey zoos everybody. So Good deal. Hey there Hi everybody Hello Sam Everybody in the audience. How you all doing? I see we have a nice little crowd going Are you sure? I sure do it's been a good show already. I I fell After I talked to you and I just overslept I slept all day yesterday. That's okay Um, you know, I I've been trying to give my sleeping because it's been a really long week But uh today I slept away on my extra time. I'll be on for a little while but then I'm gonna have to go I did get a few hours of sleep. So I guess that's not bad So that's good. Yeah, as long as you're safe What's that Sam? All right, as long as you are safe Yeah, yeah, of course, of course Yeah, it's a big part of it when when you're uh driving You really don't want to be that short on sleep, right? Probably not a good idea, but uh Hi, Audrey. Hi everybody um, I didn't want to discuss that um, not the old 2018 that I sent to Rebecca, but I don't want to I don't want to discuss what looks like those asteroids because they really look to me like They could possibly be the the spiral asteroid It's just not in the right place to be the spiral asteroid, but it's two of them Just the way we had discussed with sam. Uh, remember sam? When I posted recently where it was two of them, um, you said that the spiral asteroid spirals because it's two of them, right? concentric orbit I I caught something very similar, but it's on the wrong side of the sun. So I might I don't know. I I want you to check it out because I uh, I don't think you've seen it on on facebook because you haven't commented on that so, okay um Is it one that you sent me? Yeah, I sent I I sent you three videos. They sent you Okay, well, let's go ahead and get him so we can talk about it. Um, let's see You've been you've posted some really cool stuff the other day and chris You had a great day. I was like, uh, I'm so jealous I those days are just awesome. Those days are crazy right now Is it I I saw a little bit earlier. I kind of kind of opened my eyes and then I I put the show on I I saw you were outside but I That was back off to sleep. So I know how that is That's a good feeling. Uh, why is it not there? Here it is. Here it is I That's a picture from vegas actually So this is I heard you last episode talking about how nostalgic you get about 2018 seven add to I'm the same way Uh, I'm gonna have to go with that to being my favorite plan. I I like the opacity But it's a little more destructive than that too. So I'm gonna have to Yeah, wow phenomenal This is a very rare occurrence. I have not seen anything the likes of this since 2018 but god, it was so awesome to see that. Yeah, at two's moon was so huge and so close for so long And and you we couldn't deny the purple in the orange scenario that was going on. Look at that bubbly bottom That is this is the same thing one of them's in real time. The other one is time lapse on a different camera But I mean look at that both cameras will show you exactly what's happening Just right over the top of you. Uh, it's one of those days where you just like what the hell man? Why is nobody seeing this? Uh, this one's recent sam. This was uh, I don't know maybe five days ago But if you see there's two there's two asterisks one just above the other And they're coming in they're coming in from the right and headed left, aren't they? Yeah Yeah, I I even recorded the trail that it leaves, right? You'll you'll see it here shortly But I recorded the trail as it was as it was wow I I didn't get it till uh, it didn't occur to me. I was like I I took this video and then I sat down outside on my porch and I was like holy crap I think this would be great time to record it and time lapse it And are you sure those are asteroids? Well I don't know what yeah What if we were looking at I've been looking at it for days and I uh, The bottom one is the ion con trail behind the side orb and the one above it is the long box view See here's a tight. Here's a time lapse. You see the trail going by Yeah I held my camera for like 10 minutes on my hand there just to get that trail. That's was why it's a little Unsteady. Oh, I wonder if that's there for 10 minutes by hand and did that Just to get I I knew I was like I had nowhere to put my camera What if that what if the big one is the is the side orb and the thin wispy one above it Look that see that triangle right there star destroyer three of them are parked right there Do one way one the other way? I know there was more that was being that's obvious to right there star destroyers in front of the long box cube well Well, there's a right side of the sun. Okay. So last time that I took yeah, so So it's not the spiral astral. I don't okay. Gotcha Not my last race so far there was a lot of stuff flying around that day. This was just early on This was a really a thicker spiral Huh They would have a thicker more notable spiral. You'd see actually the spiral. Yeah, that's why I was confused I was it's two of them like like like sam said, but I don't really see that I would have to say that bottom trail the thicker white cloud is is the drag-off cloud of the side orb off the long box cube Because that's the only thing that goes that direction Wow Yeah, I was a little I was a little confused. I was like it looks like the spiral But it doesn't have that effect that the spiral would have matched each other last right does pattern then it would have been asteroids But they didn't match each other those were two completely different sets of clouds And the one was thicker and closer to earth and the other one with wispier and more hidden and angular straight lines So that leads me to believe it's the long box cube in the side or That's crazy. I would have not have guessed that I would not have did you see did you see a fonts? Uh, can you find that again? Uh, I just saw what he posted seven hours ago. That was freaking close They're part right Reach up there and touch it Absolutely phenomenal. Yeah, this one. I just saw this one. I see two boxes there The darker one is the long box in front and the texas cube is behind They are literally right next to each other. I mean The cube it just looks so long like it looks like two long box cubes But it's not right. I mean not no, okay I I think the maybe that maybe the long box cube is smaller than the Texas cube, of course, we've never had them parked it next to each other to ever judge that And it's not like we can pull out our space laser measuring stick Uh, but yeah, it definitely looks like two separate boxes to me Yeah And the light difference between that straight line and beginning them. Yes, uh, exactly The edge of the long box cube. I mean that's that That straight line to the left of the sun lower left Is that the texas cube No, I think you're I think they're both on the right hand side of the sun in this shot I think the long box cube is the dark blue square and the gray blue square behind it is the texas cube Oh, wait, okay. I know I I could be a third destroyer. I could be wrong. I don't know But to me it looks like Or maybe I mean Right, it's too straight to be not a cube and then of course we we'd like earlier we cited the the space tube aside the long box cube which it hasn't ever been before Uh, the space tube was always just to the right of the sun Where the long box cube was always far to the right of the sun next to a sathom jello moon But all that's changing now that the sathom jello moon is so vastly large Which shows you that the long box cube is much closer to us Which is also matches this shot and then the shots we got in last week where the long box cube was huge unbelievably large And that's because this planet and the moon Are much closer not that it moved but it just looks bigger because now it's way closer to us Yeah, there's a lot a lot going on up there Look besides 2018. This is the closest I've ever seen Yeah, well, we're you know at the end of 180 and they're right over the top of us Wow, absolutely. They are going by I haven't had I you know the the planet uh Sightings here have not been as prevalent. It's asteroids that I've been seeing all over the place Yeah, asteroids like just look at that. We're spinning by everyone. That thing is that just lead It'll be a clear sky Right completely clear and then you'll have the trail like that. I just saw that was the only literally the only thing in the sky Which is why it drives me nuts. I'm in the dark mob Nothing else in the sky all that it was was that just line that went from the from the sun all the way to to the east I don't know it went from the moon was the moon because it was a sunrise Went all the way from the moon to the sun How come everybody didn't see this? This up on the entire planet didn't see this new rebeck. Is this From a pond yeah, this is it three or four days ago I don't know Those stripes those stripes are very indicative and that's the first thing to look for when it comes to the Lead object guys is those those stripy effect That's crazy and the size is perfect as well for the lead object That is insane. That is absolutely insane Uh alphonse been catching some great stuff. Yeah Andrea you don't do coffee I don't know if we can be friends I'm kidding. I'm kidding, but yeah, I I'm obsessed with coffee I uh, I quit all my other bad habits. I stopped drinking stuff everything but I I hit the coffee hard now, so Yeah, I still I'm a coffee drinker. I forgot to show you That when hazus sent me those earrings he sent me the sticker too. I forgot to show the sticker It says here is his little cute guy Anyway, it says take me to your favorite coffee shop So in that cute They had this little coffee shop inside of the convention Greatest coffee and the nicest lady. She was just so nice I ended up going to a shop Actually, because she says she had a shop. That's where I got sam's coffee cup was uh, but The greatest people really really nice friendly everybody when I was there and uh, I had to get that sticker I was like who drinks coffee. I like sam drinks coffee and rebecca drinks coffee. So I got One of each for you guys something coffee related Right. Yeah, it's too cute Um, I want to say hi to abcd is here abcd Good to see you. It's been a minute since we've seen you. So glad you're here And I'm Getting some uh video pictures ready that Tara sent me so we're gonna see you out here in a moment Um Let's see what else I don't I don't understand warm tea. Maybe maybe it's because of different. I don't know. Uh, I love cold tea sugar-free cold cold tea with so much ice I love it. Absolutely love it. There's three things that I drink. It's water Coffee and iced tea I love it. Uh, and the occasional diet coke Um But I love tea. I just I don't really care like when it's warm. I just don't I don't I don't know It loses a lot of its flavor. Maybe it's all in my head. I don't know You gotta have like a good a good tea, you know Well, uh, you know you in vegas, that's perfect for brewing tea outside man for just getting it Oh, yeah, just leave it outside in the sun and then put some ice on it like, you know, leave it out there for like the whole day Yeah, oh, I am I hear Earl gray. I've never had it Andrea, but I always that's my favorite Maybe we should get together and have some tea and skip the coffee sometime But I have not tried it and I hear some some people drink it with milk which Doesn't make sense to me, but that doesn't mean I mean, I like it. I have a friend who takes me to Different restaurants that I would never go to and I'm always delighted. I always have a great time. It's always great food because I realized over the years that I uh I've gone in a comfort zone when it comes to what I eat and what I uh What I uh consume and get to get outside of your uh your comfort zone and experience new themes because and I'm back Cutting pizza, Sam. Yep. God no burns this time I didn't throw the pizza on the floor. Ha ha did that like a couple weeks ago Hmm There was a handhold in the cutting board and I hit it with last time with The pizza cutter and it flipped the whole pizza board and everything onto my lap and onto my hand and onto the floor So unfortunately shallow lost half her pizza No armor Yeah, well, it's okay, right Stop happen we have technical difficulties and no hamsters were injured in the making of this film No, they were all volunteers right no, you uh, you you can't uh what do they say, uh You know don't show them uh Don't threaten me with the bad time. It's a good time. I think that's the one there we go So Show 85 everybody. Okay Yeah, I The music keeps stopping on by itself Well, I gotta say Last week so they went on for nine hours. I have to say one of the most enjoyable shows that I've seen Uh in a while. I don't know what it was. It was like nine hours. I just kind of flew by It didn't fly by Days to watch it all to hear it during the work, but I was like, I don't know. What is it? Tara, I just want to say I love what you bring to the show I'm glad that you uh, you bring this is a really great vibe to this show and I think you are I think you fit right in with the group. So, uh, that was awesome. I I loved uh I I love the vibe. Yes, uh, our last week show was great. It was a great show It was nice to meet him as well Put a face to the voice, you know, right? So it's nice to have him on too. That was it was a great show And I of course said far too much It's uh, I told too much off-world information. I wanted there. There's some things in there that I uh, Probably will p.m. You about so be looking out for that some because there's a few things that I'm interested But I know I I don't want to push them any further because I I know that uh, That was how your comfort zone, but there was something that I do worry about what I say here because you know, I don't want to get us all shut down And uh, where they just come in and say, okay, that's it. You said too much, you know There was some really interesting things that you uh touched on and uh, I um I really want to hear more or at least because I googled a lot of it or some of it and I could have not find nothing on it. So uh Yeah, I'll remember remember the pleiadian message it is on uh, rebecca did Post a copy of that on her youtube site also you go to the nibburu followers anonymous and then you can type in Uh pleiadian message samuel hoffman and you'll get a copy of that video Um, there is a lot of information in that speech that the lady is giving now granted There is a percentage of it that is misleading inaccurate But that has to do with the level of of terminology that is being handed to you by the the author of And I don't directly attribute it to be actually the the pleiadian sending it might be I don't know Uh, I never did consider them. Absolutely. That's who sent this Video or made this video But they are they're talking and I apologize for saying this but they're talking to school children And part of the pleiadian message is given to you with some Prejudices in there as well, which also makes me believe that it wasn't necessarily written per say verbatim from the pleiadians, but yet some earthly person who was saying this is a pleiadian message But um, it's a very good video It has a lot of the background information in there that you need And I watch it all the time because I still pick up these little nuances that I hadn't gotten before Another good one is is symbols of an alien sky by the thunderbolts project. That's an excellent movie. Do you watch it? I At least five times I do I I watch that I I watch it every so often because I yeah, I watch maybe 50 times already a lot. I watch it and I still learn I'm always learning new stuff Well, that's the thing it's why I like repeating interviews with you sam or or Videos like that because every single time that you see him It's like you pick up on something that you didn't pick up last time that you saw it right right And repetition is the best way to learn Also as well so well, it's anything like that that that hopey drawing that that christopher reused a picture of in his video That hopey rock wall carving it stands about god. I think it's like 15 feet by You know 18 feet tall or something like that or even bigger. I know it's a very large petroglyph, but people see only that photograph of it, but That alone every time I look at it. I learn from it and you know like the three kings postcard that you sent me and stuff and I'm still looking at that And and you know, there's always something that we miss and then you just get the you get that pattern in your eye and just like that that video that we showed at the beginning of the show where They're standing on top of of that big box floating over the audience at that concert And how that reminds us of the long box cube and god that you know, wow Uh, very strange. They're talking about it sam. They're talking about the cube Yeah, it's been mentioned a lot more. I think christ has posted something on tiktok about The cube and and alexa. It was really interesting video. Um But uh, I've been I've been hearing uh, the cube being spoken about more and more on Yeah in little blurbs from news and hints and uh around the world people are mentioning that they have seen this cube And of course they don't realize it's you know, it's something we've been watching for you know, almost a decade Um the the empire orb, of course, which does look like the death star from star wars except the facial Uh, the the oculus where the eye is has an array of lights that is different Sam did you see did you see that video with mr. MBB? 333 uh, it was It was a very close. It was it's pretty old. It's maybe a year old But it was a video of what looks like It it's it has to be a star destroyer, but it is so freaking close to earth and so freaking enormous Yeah, they are overhead at night The sides of these things are just absolutely Mainboggling to think three to five football teams long, but you think that they're the little ones that come out of a bigger Yeah, mother ship Wrap your mind around it But it is if you haven't seen it chris you should look for it. It's uh, mr. MB is freaking crazy I don't know what he's calling in in the video Uh, but it's just a big freaking start a story basically don't start a story It's just you can see it really low on the horizon and it's literally taking up the entire camera view it is nice I I have seen one of those landed on on an air force base And I have seen one fly over close and it wow Yeah, and then I'll drop the land or craft and this is our abduction story And then they came down in a spiral disc with two sets of windows And then they came down over the top of us and then the big circular light turned on on the ground And whatever you do do not walk inside that that circle of light Uh, because uh when you do Uh, everything in your body shuts off except your brain That is where they turn off the human off switch and they've got you and then you'll stand there frozen And then they'll land their little craft and the little gray guys will 12 or 15 gray guys will come running out of it and they'll grab you and take you in there and put you on the examination table And they sample you just like they sample wolves or elephants or tigers or or pandas or penguins or walruses or anything around the planet the way we treat them and that's what they that's an abduction And then they you can't remember anything because they shut everything off And I don't know if they give you a drug or a medication or whatever or it's already built into our our brain chemistry Uh, but when they're done examining you they put you back And they take off and roughly 15 minutes to a half hour Your brain comes back to reboot and you get up off the ground wherever they've laid you and then you have absolutely no memory Why or how you got there? It must be a drug It must be because our bodies are so built for We have all these receptors in our body and look at the medications They have for anis general anesthesia is incredible Oh or harmonic that you know, it's like, you know, baby goats have that that thing where they they they immediately go into a seizure and freeze and drop over sideways And you know They put us in a white light or circular white light with a tone of sound And we you know, we turn into baby goats and we fall over You know, I would think so And that that's how it it works and they and humans have an off switch and I hate to tell people that but we do And If you think about anesthesia like that they have it's called a bismontitor. So they've got this monitor. They put this little uh, you know Lead on your forehead and it checks to see your brain waves while you're under anesthesia So you don't have that problem waking up Right and they also make sure while you're put under Yeah, I've been I've been under that where they go on all that they you're awake, but you're not you don't form any memory You want to be awake and paralyzed? That's like the worst thing that can happen to you. Can you imagine? Being awake during an operation. No, yeah, as a matter of fact, I can because I sat up on When during a skull surgery When they split the roof of my mouth open And they split my septum. I woke up Yeah, and I heard it pop and I screamed And then I had that big huge titanium headdress where they had screws in my forehead and screws in my jaw To keep my mouth open in this big headdress I mean this damn thing weighs 40 pounds And I sat up with that damn thing on my on my head and pulled my neck muscles and scream And I you know, I wake up on the table And I have to warn my doctors including the pleiadians excuse me I'm going to wake up on your table Which is why they took me aside and talked to me in the first place, but I also wake up in the middle of anesthesia That's not good. That's kind of just gotta be a crazy Yeah To the answer I don't know. I'm not a doctor Yeah, you know, don't overdo me. Don't give me too much anesthesia, but be ready I may actually sit up on the table on you and I pre-warn Anytime I've ever been first because after doing it once I've warned people that I may sit up on the table in front of you because it's happened before Sam hey Zeus, uh, do you know where hollywood boulevard is in vegas like all the way on sunrise mountain? I uh vaguely You know like if you drive east and you go all the way Towards the mountain that's kind of where I live So I'm gonna walk up there you guys and it might take me like 15 minutes But it's like a higher vantage point and you can see the whole city from up there. So And the sky is looking crazy right now. So, um Like 15 minutes All right Can't wait. All right. I'll be right back. Okay, gris. All right. Can't wait Our man on I wanted to ask you before we get off topic here, uh Psychologically, I think a lot of people uh, and you say this often which I I truly agree. Um It's not as easy as you know, take me with you. Uh, no, it's not it's But psychologically, what did that do to you? I mean you you're uh, you're a strong minded person which I think You know any I think if anybody would be able to handle it be you but I I would imagine even to use something like that It's a roller coaster ride. It really is because part of you Psychologically, you just can't be the same I know I I I never went through any guilt factor like I'd done anything wrong in order for that to happen But I did suffer that oh no, it didn't happen and oh, yes It did happen back and forth and back and forth for a very long time And most of it was wiped out. I had pieces of it at first Only tiny little slivers and then in like 97 It just just like somebody opened up the tailgate on a big dump truck and it just washed me away with memory So you kind of blocked it out as well. Yeah, you yeah, you do because you're common No, no, I I know I I have had a lot of I had some traumatic things happen in my childhood that uh Up until recently like after my divorce and after doing Therapy I uh, it came back and kind of hit me like a ton of breaks. So in your mind in Yeah, you talk yourself out in an attempt to protect itself Right will block some things out and kind of just make you forget but it's still there Yeah, and it does come back in little ways and you can even you can even be Miserable in certain ways and not even realize why you're feeling uncomfortable or why you're behaving in poorly or or less than admirably and um When it when it came back to me. I all of a sudden I just like I remembered just most everything And over only over a little bit of time has more come but I I know for a fact what we were doing And where we were and the fact that I wasn't alone and the other guys and I know what went on inside the ship I know what went on outside the ship. I know what went on before we got on the ship I know where we were we had this huge pile my friend One of my friends was a pyro and he liked to throw you know in montan others watch the pyro And this guy had we had this huge lawn garden And by the time we got back to the map It was only coals And they were just glowing in the darkness So there was a good deal of time lost And that was a great deal of me wanting to remember wanting to remember good six eight hours Just about at least three hours now At least three hours and uh, and then we were also When we got laid down on the ground They started laying us down in an area that had a lot of water it was swampy And so one of the guys pretty much was drowning When they laid him down they weren't too pleased with him at all because he was kicking them Uh, we had began as part of the what brought the memory back to me was His boots and his boots kicking the graze and they were fighting him. He was fighting them And they told me to tell my friends that if they didn't behave themselves, none of us would go home We would just vanish so I had to go in there and and and Farley with my friend and get him to stop fighting this because there was nothing they could do about it And I don't know what happened afterwards, but that was part of the flag that reminded me these things And every time I would look at my friend and those boots I would always have this how much mud have you got stuck in those boots right now reaction and it kept talking to me kept talking to me kept talking to me and then part of the admission the readmission in my brain in 97 98 Was remembering that one of the key memory The thing that I remember the most was that the investigators was those boots And that's what part partially and this is what I did with when the government had me at in dc And my memory was screwed with Some of these key notes that I brought that memory back with are related to the guy shaking and screaming in my face with the dandruff and meeting the the gray in the in the lab coat Fragmented memories that are there And you don't remember the rest of it and then over time those fragments get bigger And then they come back and then all of a sudden Act five of hamlet, you know and boom there it is And you have to weigh and you said psychologically then you have to weigh Whether or not your bat shit crazy. Have you lost your mind and is this something that you got that one? I think all of us may maybe i'm not on that scale, but I think any of us that are here seeing what we see Feel on a daily basis. Am I am I bat shit crazy? Am I losing it? Have I lost it? It's a constant back and forth constant back and forth But the sky always reminds you that no You are not bat shit crazy. This is actually there it is again I'm gonna pull what you said last show that I loved sam You said This has to take hold People have to accept this information because it is real I love that you said that I I It was really inspiring to hear you say that sam because I'm not gonna lie I have moments where i'm like are we just talking on the wall or are we just echoing But I I think the truth can only be suppressed so long Well, the truth always has to be no um, yeah, this is uh Regardless of where they're not this ever goes anywhere We have this this is ours and that's you know on one hand It's not enough, but it should be enough, but it is enough and you know I I agree some here's here's where i'm at right now. Um I know that not everybody from my experience and I think everybody will agree here um when I first Understood this I was very excited about sharing it with people thinking Oh, I'll have to do a share it show them this video or this exciting and People will accept it. Uh, in fact The fact that people wouldn't accept it it never crossed my mind. I was always I have to show people this and I was slowly reminded that it doesn't work that way that right right Not everybody's gonna accept and the fact that we have 150 000 to 800 000 photographs of these clients over the last decade doesn't matter either And this is part you know, even what christopher guy christopher did good videos I set out sam to My mission and it still is my mission to this day very day Is to find is to make the Is to make videos that were so obvious that they cannot be denied Right where people had to accept it Then I realized um That even that doesn't work Um, yeah, and it could be it could be a shock to the system to realize that We live in a world where evidence doesn't really Make a difference all that make me all that matters what you've been told and told and ingrained in your Hardwired into your brain and that's upsetting Very I thought 2012 everybody could easily see never I struggle with that constantly sam with the fact that people will not will just refuse this information I I struggle with the constantly it It annoys me it baffles me, but I've come to accept it. I've come to accept it I'm at the point now where I do this because I enjoy it very much watching the system is one of the Highlights of my life I'm happy knowing that I was That I was uh that I had front row seats to the greatest two men of all time And I will never stop making videos. I I have to I enjoy it. I love it. I uh, I live for those moments Whatever comes of it Is extra, you know because yeah, I'm enjoying it myself. I've made uh I made some amazing friends. I've met some amazing group of people along the way, you know So we we have a family here. We we all see the same things. We are not crazy or wrong this has been You know in science it's it's repeat You know evidence gather evidence a great book series over and over Me yeah, yeah, yeah, well, you know, this will hold up in any core and any science project But it is upsetting sometimes that it doesn't but you have to learn to live with that You have to learn to live with that because if you don't it will drive you nuts. It'll drive you crazy I do it out of love out of just loving watching the system. It's just god I mean wow, how could you know want to watch that? It's just the most exciting thing ever, you know, um So yeah, that's where i'm at. That's where i'm at. I I accept that not everybody's in acceptance I I post something in hopes that you know, we we find another terror another chris another You know, it's such a huge letdown that nasa is not doing their part. They're distracting us with the with the james Web telescope and all of this and they're reminding us that they don't really know what they're talking about and yet they're You know granted they can't say anything about what's going on right in front of us Because that does fall under classified and you know within the neo classified issue Uh, and so that we are kind of breaking the rules a little bit Although we are sharing our opinions and we're not sharing documented information from nasa. So therefore we're safe, but yeah, um Even 10 years from now After the rest of the world finally catches up with what we've been talking about for two decades by then Then they'll want to go back on our information and go Wow, these guys really knew what they were talking about And we have all the evidence and which reminds me I do need to do another backup of my Of my file because I boy there's thousands and thousands and thousands of pictures. I would hate to lose Although I do have most of them on file, but I need to started uh, actually I started, um gathering all that all my favorites onto uh an external uh hard drive um just in case because Um, you know, it's really easy for us to forget the magnitude of what we're doing here. Um, I want to remind everybody here that We we are at the basically the cutting edge of of Of science, you know, um, unfortunately nasa is not come is not forthcoming and and We're the only ones doing this. So we have to protect this information. Um, because Anything can happen at any moment where they get to wipe us out. I mean, what's happened to rebecca's What your own two accounts now that have been just wiped out, you know, right, right? and and the more uh, the more Things become obvious. I think the more they're gonna mess with this because I do feel that they're messing with this I've literally been on youtube, uh When I saw the our our view count go backwards, you know, I've seen that I've literally seen that. Um So I think it's in front to uh protect as much as we can because Maybe this generation won't accept it, but maybe next one, you know, or or or I I do feel we're the ones getting the ball rolling But I have accepted that it might not that it might take some some time, you know, um Unfortunately, I might take a big event to wake people up and honestly even and I wouldn't be surprised if people would just blame it on ex Country and say it was an attack. I wouldn't be surprised If if we have a big asteroid event And people decided blame it on war a war act an act of war on some country because That's why of course though. Yeah, of course the line. Yeah um, the thing is that that we we uh Here's here's what I think about the difference between some of us here all of us here And most people in the world is that? I personally I live up there My mind is constantly thinking up there most people I see Their peripheral vision their way of thinking it's all really worldly. It's all down here I don't think any of us lived out here as much as as the rest of the world. Um I know you sam I I know uh most of us walk here with their head up high looking up at the sky constantly Uh worldly things just have lost their appeal. Yeah, don't get me wrong I I think it's very important to continue life and do worldly things and enjoy your family and that kind of stuff, but I've lost interest in so many worldly things since knowing this because it gives you a An overview of the world in such a different light um and and I think I have said this before I think that it's uh That it's something that would benefit the world if we could all get people to see the world through these eyes through this Through this lens, I think we would we would treat each other differently because I think we would leave behind all our petty little differences You know, I I think Personally, that's what it did to me is that I I stopped I stopped putting so much attention on dumb shit that doesn't matter, you know And uh, I I I take life more serious. I don't take things for granted Uh, I know that we're just a small speck You know in the vast space, um And we're very grateful to be here even though uh There's some tricky new reasons why we're here, but I mean we're here nevertheless, you know, and I We should be grateful for that and I'll take you for granted Regardless of how we got here, you know, because that's That could be uh, you could have mixed emotions, you know about how we were placed here, but I were only here for a very short time Yeah, yeah, exactly. Thank you short I mean, I'm on the other side of that that countdown, you know I'm in I'm 63 now and I'm like, uh-oh Holy cow, you know, I only got on average 20 years left And and that's that's short Yes, I'm uh Yeah, you know my parents both lived in there into their 80s and so, you know, that's my Frankly, I want to live to 200 but oh my god. Can you imagine how old your bones and fingers would be? Yeah, well, I have to find the Kind of assistance some kind of Desty Yeah Tara, I love what you said, uh You have a fomo about a fear of missing out I I I suffer from that constantly Constantly I I have I have a problem with that but I agree um But I I also agree with sam says said to me uh when I told him I I said the same thing I miss so much, you know when I first came Um, but uh sam told me uh your time is your time, you know, you know, it's not one of those things you can rush It's not one of those things that It's just one of those things that you just wake up whenever you wake up, you know, and that's that's it. That's just the way it works, you know Uh, yeah, I I feel like you Didn't miss some stuff but some very cool stuff is about to happen It is happening and it's about to happen. Well as they as they move away from What's happening? It is happening. Yeah, but as they move away from us, uh, I was telling uh Alexander this recently, uh They're very hard to photograph right now very hard to photograph as they move out We're gonna have a chance to start catching them again in their entirety and that's gonna be fun because that's uh That that was my whole thing was try to catch them in motion Right as they're moving And and be able to see the whole ring the whole circle And we're in the habit of looking next to the sun to the right. It's of left But when you're looking at the sun Stop what you're doing and turn around all the way the opposite direction 180 Look the other side of the sun and you will see a facially illuminated very very large planet in front of you or overhead of you Away from the sun. It's time to start looking at everywhere Do the 360 don't just do the the 90 degrees on one side 90 degrees on the other Do the 180 look the other direction? And and and see that the idea because andry was just saying I can't wait to see them when they're facially eliminated Well, that is happening already It's happening now never is facially illuminated at dues facially eliminated And look at what the book chris just posted that is one how of an illumination I mean that thing was so obvious and in your face That was awesome. That's red one Um Because I don't know he posted that was maybe maybe a day or two ago, but it was freaking awesome Oh, yeah, christopher does those two videos that he did that he just posted and I recommend people go go Uh sign up on chris's youtube site And give him some likes and some some uh some followers because uh, he's not getting enough viewing And he deserves that he's doing an excellent job. It's called naviru system sky watchers That's the name of this I've been tagging it in all of my videos. I've been tagging it Naviru system sky watchers and he said he's almost there. It's uphill and he's like a few minutes away So he sent me a message Hey, it's me and daddy poteet I think it's how you say that hi Welcome. Hello. Good to see you. I don't know if I've seen that name before. Are you guys? Uh, nice So but hi, I like seeing a new name new people. Cool. Welcome aboard That's exciting Give it some time and he will be amazed at what we have uh the uh, man other here for you guys It's fun Andrea People often ask me why I haven't had kids I think it's because i'm done. I think i'm not coming back this time. I'm going So Yeah, okay That's what I tell people Uh, it's my last day on earth. So um, I'm done. You know, I'm I will not reincarnate back here anymore. I'm I'm an old soul Right, you know, that's my story and I'm sticking with it Keep on trucking Yeah, yeah keep on trucking. Yeah, that's an old 70s term. I still chuckle over there It actually it's it's uh Uh, I managed the test of time because people still know about keep on trucking And oh my god, we were saying that about the woodstock era, you know, I was like nine when woodstock happened No, I remember that saying from high school from yeah, I remember Hey, you still see those, uh Trucker hats, you know, anytime I go into loves, you know, the truck stop loves I uh, I like to gas up at loves because it's cheaper but uh, I always see key chains and you name it with what that's saying on them God reminds me of the old cb days when everybody was into the cbs and breaker one nine this year You know, oh my god, that was the lifetime No, no now now we're doing that here, you know, and we're doing our cb talking on the internet With our faces and breaker one nine this year the rubber duck and we're done telling you about that Space cubes and all the star destroyers and extraterrestrials coming down to a swamp near you Yeah, they're quite real. I I I'm in awe that this has not I mean, I mean look at that that miami exciting thing did Look how crazy everybody went over that now granted. We still don't even know if it was real or not Although there was some definite activity in the skies with helicopters and other shit that they don't come up with to do a movie Uh, you know event or you know a fake uh, a fake flag or whatever Because there was a lot of activity around that it's gone away. Nobody even talks about it anymore. Go ahead Well, I just feel like they do go all out in psyops and false flags So I mean like they'll just stop at nothing to You know put that message across that's how desperate they are to you know, keep people in the dark I mean, it's like full fledg 100 all out Well, we saw was pretty spooky and convincing in certain ways And then there was the creatures that were running that were just didn't make any sense And then there was the big tall shadow guy and then there was the craft With the with the the lasers in the sky and all of that that we did also see as well And we linked that information which was separate of the miami event, but oh my god, you know That we talked about starter thrower is being very close. They'll be off the deck. They'll fly over at night And you won't even hear them and the only reason you'll know they're there is if the animals come running out of the forest And you happen to look up right at the right time when there's a central illumination You can see the bottom of these damn things from city lights or whatever And uh or local illumination street lights, whatever and those things are absolutely silent and they're regularly huge Star destroyers fly But a mile or two or five miles over the top of surfaces regularly The landing craft are all over we're seeing them in sightings from around the world Every day in europe all the time and they of course get lost right away And the empire orb we've seen in the long box cubed in texas cube and all the space tube and all the God, how many sightings do we have of the uh star fighter docking stations? I mean all of those are repeatedly captured and they match time after time after time And they're not just the blobs flying around in the sky that we can't identify When we call the oa to uap or ufo. No, we're having direct Absolutely close captures from around the world for years now and i'm so wondering when People are going to either get on board with the fact now granted. I understand this is a very fearful topic and again, I I dare you At the end of this show on youtube if you go to watch it again on youtube On the brew followers anonymous for rebecca I I I dare you to make a comment about what you think about these cubes or the star destroyers Or the space tube or the or the empire orb or any of this Nobody is commenting about the extraterrestrials that are parked over our heads by the Thousands right now and i mean thousands of beings and hundreds of ships Nobody has yet to comment and i've asked show after show after show for somebody to comment And we can't do a better show until you tell us how so go to youtube after tonight's show Watch a second copy of it or log in so that you can comment. We want to hear your comments There's two things that get the the algorithm going and and one of those main ones is Comments guys. It's not just the likes likes how The views help but the comments are what really gets the algorithm going. Um, whether they're positive or negative Uh, I stopped deleting rude comments on my videos because even those help I I I've come to a point where i'm like as long as you're interacting This pushes the algorithm to to send this out to more people. So I I just I I let I let the hateful comments just be uh, I don't even I even respond back to them because it gives me an opportunity to comment again So I I reply back to the hateful as they're laughing. I'll be like i'm so happy you're happy yourself You know, but yeah, um, so positive or negative Comment is helpful. There's no such thing as bad publicity as a So just comment. It doesn't have to be a Big elaborate count comment. Just get the conversation going guys. That's really All it's about and then get people talking about this because we really need to get people talking about it Extra terrestrials are very very very real. I have met three separate races and yes You know anytime anybody tells me that I barely believe them Until they start giving me details About the description and how they reacted and how how they appeared because most people they'll say oh, I saw this But then they don't give you any personal description of the creature If they're missing that then they're then they're missing the story Hey guys, look at that sunset. Hey, Chris. I tried to make it on time. Oh, wow Yeah, look at that you it's so perfect I got some more video of it about two minutes ago, but It's really hard timing. I've never walked this far up the mountain before so Oh, wow And I know you don't know I think I know exactly where you are Chris I'm like on the east side of Las Vegas. Yeah, I Long box cube is right there Still there Yeah, it's right there. A lot of things tricking by my friend. Yeah, you see the three stripes in the gray Right above that light post It was pretty illuminated a few minutes ago, but Let's see if I can walk down the street and uh See if you could see anything better You should this is where you should have your big blue sign that says never who is here. I know right? That's me. Why? We mean, uh, okay, so he needs a t-shirt, Sam. We need some of the sky watchers t-shirt. There you go Um, I would love to get those three If you get those going again, then you know so I can I did I did Deb, um If perhaps Rebecca if if I give you Deb's Link Yeah, time that you can talk to her She can give you the information how we can get through the company that she used Uh to make because they were quality. They were really good t-shirts and they hold up very well And they were working easy. What was it 25 dollars that they were I didn't get a chance to get me one last time They were right, but I would love to stay in here I love you Chris won because uh, he needs to walk around with one of those in vegas, you know, yeah It'll make it easier than going from person to person talking to them, you know Also, what I want to do what I'm going to do soon too is give me some some business cards I could just hand them out. I'm going to make followers anonymous business cards Oh, I can't get Rebecca's channel and get this going I like to talk youtube uh facebook etc and give all of those links available that way you can hand it to them And if you can afford to you can have a good picture of one of the early Planets on there or something or absolute nibburu or like I did I did in a gold card As the reason I did in a gold card a it's pretty and be it directly has to do with our existence Sort of a big metaphor I think people would remember a card like this and I I know I uh, you know, it's vivid in my mind Every time those little cards I love them. I love them They're so simple, you know, yeah, yeah They were not cheap, but they they they are simple, you know, and they are different special in gold and Yeah, they were not the cheapest card stock available. I promise you that They don't love cheap. They don't know They they were a little pricey to have printed up and I'm on my third box already Uh, my first one my first ones were white and then I went to the gold and then I went through that batch of well over 500 and now I'm Uh, I'm down to about 30 or 40 of the gold on my second 500 Yeah, I think you should stick with the gold. Uh, there's something about them that just kind of Okay, cool Although I'm gonna have to add more more information on that including, you know, your followers anonymous tiktok youtube Etc Yeah, yeah Yeah, I I think uh, new beer followers anonymous youtube is the main one we really should be pushing right right right Um, what I've started doing now is instead of my my youtube channel. I don't really post a lot there But I do stream this so I can comment on this so instead of sharing my channel. I've been sharing rebecca's That way because because I mean Most of the bulk of our views come from her channel There's two star destroyers underneath that you see that the black lines one two three right in front of us there with that little patch of white There's two to start star destroyers underneath that and the monkey patch just to the right of the light pole is the is the Uh, uh side orb and the three little gray black lines. That's where the long box cube is Or it could even be bigger and that larger way could even be that larger No, I'm not sure that larger blue above there like wow that's huge Hey guys, uh, unfortunately, I'm running out of time here Uh, unfortunately, I I slept off my extra time that I have for the day um But um, yeah, unfortunately, why do we're here? We understand like to work. I know love senior I really uh I really needed a This time, but uh, I guess maybe next week the next week. I'll have more time. Hope so. It's it's been It's been a really busy month. I'm telling you I slept all day yesterday That is and then you wake up and it's like that's my kind of party the phone call or this That is my kind of party chris. That is my kind of party is uh, what do you do for fun? I like to sleep That is that is my kind of party, but uh, yeah, we'll see you guys next week. I will be listening as always But uh, yeah, unfortunately duty calls. Um, sure All right guys. Love you guys. Well, good seeing you again. Drive careful always Have a good night. Okay. See you next week. Bye guys. Okay. Bye. Bye Okay, that went too fast Yeah, they always do um, you know, we're at we're at four hours 47 and there's no good reason to do We don't have to be nine hours, but it's definitely not three hours. So Thank you, kenneth. All right All right Yeah, I'm feeling my I am feeling my joints and oh god. I was like I have new pains and things that hurt me that I've never experienced before And it's like are you kidding me? What's happening crap, you know So this is being 60 something. Oh joy Everybody should try this. It's so fun Right Oh, the planets are you know, you know, I'm not gonna say they're killing me But boy, this is a thing to deal with man. Oh god with what our bodies are going through and I mean, I don't I can't remember ever being This nauseous nonstop You know being on the on seasick on the boat Yeah, you're kidding me And my sleep schedule is all screwed up and all my life I've gotten up normally at five o'clock in the morning on the dock You know like so like I have this internal clock and now I'm getting up at three I mean, what the hell So everything's messed up Our normal is not normal anymore Right and everything's on the edge. Oh look the desert Right. Yeah, you found the edge of the ground or the sky You're you were pointing it at the sky, but I saw the sand I saw the sand dunes. So I think this is probably the best spot I can find There So what's that see that uh, I don't know that streak that's curved and coming down is that anything in particular? Yeah, you know, it's just nose diving It looks like it looks like a fighter jet, but it's way way too big to be a jet Uh could be an asteroid coming in Then cropping in I just wondered if it looks significant I think all this is I sat him right like Yeah Yes The eye on tail just going right there get centers to green asteroid Green asteroid in in that blue area that wispy multiple finger thing No over to the right a little bit more And then right enough up Yes, David. It was like that Uh a little bit more dead center that weird patch right there dead center That's where the green asteroid is Because it's got a little Yeah, so And that oh by the way, you can see the side of never You know what? Yeah, going keep going a little bit more No to your right to your right like right there. That's where nabiru is and that this area Right there. Yeah, there's a big mountain in the way right there Wow, no, it looks good fingers and everything. Yeah, that's right there. That's You can see it's showing itself with those lines Wow Yes It's big Wow, that's where it is in the uh evening sunset time And that's where I would be where a nana emel seru should be and then I think we're seeing gray dots of An emel seru and then the green asteroid is in front of them See that little circular dark spot right there above the Or just below the white little white cloud. There's a dark gray dot And that's about the size of what emel seru looks like. Okay And then nana orbits emel seru Wow in a concentric orbit And that's the side the last time I saw Uh in 2012 I I saw early early sightings of nibiru and you could plane this day see both moons And then the little one little and it was fast enough. It wasn't really fast But the little moon nana going around concentrically around Uh emel seru and it took a little time, but you got to watch it plane this day And you know land masses in normal clouds This is right there. You're you're getting to a satum yellow moon and a satum just at the sun there And then above that you notice how there's like these uh like striped rays Yeah, they kind of like fan out. It's like red blue red Yeah, that's that's like Four or five days now at sunset. There's these it's a rosation flare because the light is shining underneath seru Oh I have pictures from yesterday There's no clouds in the sky, but you can see it completely and then the sky has just been turning red like this every night for like the last two days It's pretty wild And if you look at the horizon just slightly middle or left of middle Right down at the at the horizon see the orange See that big circle That is most likely the base cloud of seru at the green notice slightly green Green blue see that little edge right there. Yep That that graduated oval. Yeah right here Wow Where seru is and then in front of seru to farther left is your re and above that And above you is out to an out to moon. Yeah And that's right there. You can see the first white stripe of the side of seru right there And that little See that little illumination dot is where matim is But matim's bigger than that But that illumination dot is one of the asteroids sticking out of the side of urie right there And that's the base cloud bottom reach of urie. That's that dark blue left corner with the stripes Yeah, you can totally see the stripes of urie Yep I wish you guys were here because it's It's just different when you're You know outside as opposed to the camera, but I mean just look how fast it's changed already. This is crazy Yeah, it does it change and I love that you did that Series roll in your video because it does show the rotation and the movement and the and the change of the planets so well And you hadn't done that before and it's excellent work. Keep it up. Okay, cool Yeah, I'll try to keep doing that and then uh, yeah, that looks like an f16 going down But it's way too big to be an f16 going down Right there that plot that one little possible. We got nellis air force base right over here Yeah, but it doesn't move. It's been in one spot the whole time That you'll hear you'll know when they fly over your head because they're they're really loud And they're fast They're pretty cool We had a guy here in town here in mazula that owned a mig if you know what a mig is yeah And talk about loud. Oh my god when that mig went over the valley you could hear it forever How do you own a mig? I don't know. I you know, I how do you get to fly it around populated areas? Yeah, I just you know, I just own a uh russian airplane, you know, it's not a big deal everybody right Doesn't everybody Yeah, you know, I'm gonna own a mig in in montana and fly it around. I I have a little bit of money. Yeah, no problem I mean, where do you get spare parts for those damn things jesus? right, I mean those planes from the 70s and 80s or something else Yeah, and the question is is how many hours have they been flying and oh my god I'd hate to work on them because they're a nightmare with old technology And all that old stuff that has to be replaced right now It's like, you know, the revamp f16s are are are highly rebuilt now And yet they're still number one on the planet for us the most versatile fighter jet is the Uh f16, right? They've got an f 34 now and an f 39 and all of this crazy shit that you could they got technology wouldn't believe look at that Oh my god, look at that right there Look at that white round. Yeah on that. Yeah, right there Look at that white little dark object that would probably Be God is that is that the lead asteroid heading downward with strange wow? Or is it smaller than the lead asteroid, but it definitely looks like something quite small and asteroid like See the little rounded circle around it, right and You can see there's another Oh gosh, there's like an edge that wraps all the way around the horizon. It's really strange Is that the side orb of the long box cube? That would be nothing of the right size for the side orb We'd think that lead asteroid would be bigger. So that would have to be right there that little c cloud I don't know over to the left of the corner right there that's c Yeah, that's that's see that c Yeah, is that the side orb in front of the long box cube? man I think uh It the size is right the long box cube has moved since we saw it last from Because it was much more like over this is northwest right this is west it might have moved. Yeah, it could be it again Remember earth is moving also Wow, right But that the size wise that's too small to be the lead asteroid It's going the wrong direction to be the green asteroid and there isn't really anything that size behind the lead asteroid it's like And that looks like the side or going one way and there's something behind it going The other way and the drag off to the right So that's probably the side orb of the long box cube and that big dark Blue area in the upper right corner is probably a very large long box cube Wow, they're here people alien ships Intergalactic draft guys can like see here Do you guys see this like band? Yeah I I can see two different colors of blue you can see the depth There's something there's something absolutely passing over Right now. Yeah, that's it's at the yellow moon. It's going now over the top of you at sunset and it should be in the view It should be due north when sunset is in the west Okay This is where I saw a couple of days ago before I did the drawing that I did So would this be the lead asteroid right here this big no, no, okay, you hire up to the right Hire up to the right. So then it's over here somewhere No higher up possibly possibly somewhere here Go go look a little more upward and then go back to the left just to see If Somewhere in there is where it should be. I think you're right with the long box cube and the side orb right here It definitely looks strange It's changing to the sea clouds You can see the the edge of The bottom of the cube. It's like coming this way And the side orb is coming down that is wild And if people would just pay attention for five minutes Just to watch the sky Just for a few minutes just to see this our skies have completely changed. There's There's no doubt about what's going on And then you go back to the horizon And then you see that line right at the horizon where the color changes too Yeah, you know, we got that yellow weird greenish yellow white normal horizon sky And then above that white that big weird funny cloud line Then you got all these bottoms of the planets and then they're completely different colors You're gonna slide illumination right there of a satium yellow moon in the upper middle right see that big white Straight finger cloud that is the side illumination of a satium yellow moon Wow Up a little higher Right see Yeah, but right directly in line with that pole look up Okay, look up See that white edge behind the pole right there. Yep Go back over to the pole go back to the left You're you've already walked past it anyway Yeah, the edge of a satium a satium gel. I'm gonna see the color difference. Yes Dark blue is a captain white light sky is normal sky with a hint of seru green blue in the background Wow, that's the left which is over the sun right see just like the monthly site drawing with the seru in the middle Yes And then you got some more asteroids popping into view there those little white dots And that is right there is the side of urie Right and the salamander asteroid group etc Wow, and that white cloud in the center is the spiral asteroid Okay, and all of their little friends that are now becoming more popular And that area is where the tan asteroid and all of that is And it's the same pattern over and over and over again incredible. I mean You would think that after sunset You would have normal illumination on both sides of the sky But there's there's not it's you can see the edge of the planets here. You can see the edge of urie Yep, at whose moon is above it, right? Yep, okay, so it's a big dark band right here. It's this Light in the sky is totally cut off And then I sat him and the yellow moon are over here That's incredible. Yeah, and it's out view which is screwing with your head Yes And then you guys said nabiru is more to the north or sorry northeast. Yeah, it is Right, exactly. And then I was going to say if you keep going to the southeast a lot of the times That's where at two is and if you keep just panning around like a lot of the times Like you keep going It would be uh, yeah southeast is a hot spot for two And that's where of course, you know at sunset You'll have the the sun in the west and if you look to the east or the southeast or the northeast You're going to see facial illumination of whatever planets over there if you look to the northeast you'll see you'll see nibiru If you look to the southeast you'll either see uh, most likely at two at two's moon and then Back towards the middle again towards the left hand side, which would at sunset would be the southwest That's where urie is Yeah, hold on real quick. Let me see if I can just take a picture here real quick Okay, the parking lot 360. Yeah, we're getting that uh, I love that walmart, but we're doing the 360 right now Okay Me Yeah, you can totally see that see that line at the bottom at the right I have to uh, is that what is that? That looks like nepacity a little bit Uh, no nepacity would be higher up into the right You're seeing the side edge of of at two at two's moon urie and I don't know my right or my left anymore And above in the middle there are asteroids going over the top And then you start getting over to that dark area on the right hand side And you've got the satin jello moon and see the little straight lines. That's the eye on tail Uh going around the satin jello moon, which is very blue. Absolutely see it now That's incredible And that dark blue area is the satin's yellow moon, but the light blue area is satin But the gray is the open normal sky But yet still has part of seru in the out view and is that a helicopter? Yeah Yeah, for some reason I live like right over They they come from like the grand canyon they go on tours out there And then they come back around this time and my street is like their avenue. Oh joy Yeah, it only lasts for about 10 minutes And then you pick up all the stuff that fell off the shelves and and right spilled coffee and all of that. Yeah Yeah, I used to live on this side of town where I'm at now when I was a kid And I was telling you the the air force base was much closer to where we were living then and stuff would fall off the walls all the time Yeah, you don't live in this Subway in brooklyn d. Thankful. Yeah, I don't know anybody could live like that It would drive me insane right you come home all your Everything's on the floor Alter guys. Oh, yeah Yeah Big shout out to slap tam. I've been watching a lot of slap tam lately And the ghosts, you know and that summer real summer fake Awesome shit. Yeah Yeah, it's it's not as not what I thought we were gonna see tonight, but Still it's the sun has been down for at least 20 minutes now. Yeah. Wow. So yeah You can just right here. You can totally see Yeah, how they're they're illuminated. It's incredible And that illuminated area that's orange just off the horizon At the center of the sun That is the bottom of serru right why it's illuminated the way it is. Otherwise, it would be dark Yeah, because when the sun goes down it gets dark. Yeah, this shouldn't be yellow like that for this long Right. No because the sun is shining on the bottom of these close passing planets. So awesome Yeah, it is they're there and everybody I close me way. No, everybody takes it for granted. Oh, normal sky. No I've noticed a lot of people this week Have actually been taking pictures of the sky Like one day I we came out of the store and at least like four people at once I couldn't believe it. I'm like Did I just step into the twilight zone? What's going on here? You ask them what they were taking pictures of the sky you know I Did you ask them I I just let them do their thing. Oh, okay You know, I thought I thought I'll just let them Let them ponder for a minute. There you go. Uh, Nicole typed in sam. I just captured a long thin self-illuminated crap lying above Erie, Colorado. I sent you a small clip and photo of it. It was awesome. All right. I will go to facebook and look I am not Currently on facebook my way about I'm overtaxing my computer Or I'd rather might not my computer but my new speed All right, the yellow part is our sky Right But just above the yellow part is seru like just above that line That's going all across the sky that straight line Right above is seru and then right above that would be Nah, probably an opacity with urie to your left and ice adam's moon to your right Basically And then back behind is cabiru to your right and at two to your left Okay, okay. Um, here is a copy of what she sent. I will send to you rebecca. It's a short small ufo Oh, yeah And uh And then there's a second. Okay. This is a picture of it So, oh wow with two others that look to be triangular crap And then a lander how interesting Uh, thank you, Nicole. Those are very viable captures cool. No, I'll get I'll get off of face. Whoops Oh god, I gotta go back to facebook because I have to send it still Uh sam come on earthbrain. All right. There is I have to pull up rebecca again And send her Uh, did I not send that to you and I sent it to her To uh, all right, berry. I'm sending that to rebecca And apparently I I sent it to you, but it didn't go weird All right. I will try it a second time I See what I get Okay, the first one says log in or sign up to view. I hope you can Well, she said she posted it to her page. She'll mean to see if I can if you want, nicole You can send it to me too and I can send it to rebecca or Well, if I post it, I'll grab a copy of it. I think I can do that easier Yeah All right, so let's see what happens when I post it To my page And then go to that and then grab No link And then I will send you the link here See if you can open this one I don't know if it's different or not hours ago I don't think that's it log in or sign up to view again. So I don't know if you can open those Oh I'm looking on montana sky watcher. I don't know this is on your PM Oh, it's on your PM. That's another good one too. I'm gonna save those Okay, I'm coming off of facebook now. She's got the best view Right Oh Nittany's kittens is here Hang on One second. Uh, just one moment Yeah, a Has got an orangey yellow open bottom floor All right, and it's there. It's been there. Oh, she's getting big I'm in I'm in No, your name Yeah, saru has been visible for a couple of months now. You just got to know where to look Right I was shocking how bad we got there and I was expecting it because I knew that we had turned a corner And the whole rotating solar system over the top of us had turned So I knew that urie had moved out of the out view way So I knew that we should be seeing saru any day now and boom there she was And then she's gotten really big in the last week even So we're gonna be seeing saru pretty predominantly most of next year Should be really cool and it's got a really intensely bright base score that is just unbelievable And I can send you an old copy of that unless you've got one of those Uh, rebecca Uh, which one grab a real quick The base core eliminated base core of saru. I know she's so cute older pictures I can grab you a quick one Oh, okay, nicole. I'll check it. Yes. Okay. Where is it? All right, this is It's like so playful. I've got and then I'll grab another one Um Uh, let's see another saru saru pictures are pretty pretty rare Here's my thing with saru is how much it looks like Neficity there's so many similarities Really, yeah, they both have an open core except that the and I sent you two pictures So you should have them now Um, if you want to show everybody the now these are years ago. These are like 2012 Uh of back when saru was starting to do the backward dance early And uh as urie swung around in my in our faces saru was backing away from us and we haven't seen saru since pretty much 2017 And she backed away and then as part of their rotational Normal spiral as their transition has gone back and forth and back and forth over the years So we didn't get to see saru a lot for a very long time And these are two of the older Base cores I got I have to include that other one because another one is also really cool Even though it's much smaller. You said it me another one. Yeah, this is that one You have trouble with this one all the time. Remember you we I kept trying to correct you how you were drawing it Oh, no Okay, I might have it because I have a series you remember this And I you know, I made a correction somewhere, but I don't even know where I put that copy It may it may be in my in my drawing file In my aminox times Yeah, these are the three stages of The bottom picture is the oldest And the first picture is the newest And the saru in the middle is the middle picture And that's how we first learned about the illuminated base core of saru And it was so absolutely unbelievably nobody's ever seen anything like this in the sky That all the way back in 2011 2012 we knew automatically that this was something to keep A copy of because it was some some completely different than anything that we'd ever seen Yeah, a little did we know what what nepesty was about to bring us which was you know, like three years later And I'm just here to buy myself la da And she popped in popped out. Maybe she's clearing her system And I said unable to send yeah, we've had a little difficulties with lots of stuff Nicole Um, there's been avenues that have been cut off from the way we do things the way we used to do things We used to have actual satellite links and stuff and you used to be able to take Captures of earthquakes from the usgs and post them and you can't do that anymore It's like they're making everything harder on people just yeah that way you can't share the information Unless you're the primary user Okay, you're locked up. I don't know you're you blink. Yeah, okay So here's my folder One of them I have on sarah picks and then I'll get the ones that you just sent me if I don't have it included But so there's your drawing the drawing seru We don't see that very often. Yeah, so there it is. Yeah That one look at that. Yeah, that's perfect Yeah, she has a really weird yeah, no Either dark blue area all above this ring is that big full circle Is a slightly tipped axis very large seru and that green dot in front of it Is not a lens flare that is that's actually nemesity I Need and the reddish orange in there where it's uh, it's happening Is in the view and never was also in this view to the far right that's off picture This is 2011. This is just And I believe this the photograph actually comes from I think it's dropping from Antarctica It was in 2011 They were just coming into view underneath earth And we never saw circular illumination before And then over time we realized that was the base core very bright very thick illuminated base core of planet seru And it doesn't have the three it only has the one thick very bright Four hey sam Sam yes Yes Oh, you're skipping in and out is you or is it me one second Sorry, I'm on them I am next door. Sorry, I'm I was online Yeah, you're patching in and out but Don't know what you're doing. It's okay um, but anyway You can see the orange illumination on the outside and that is atmospheric illumination, which is why it's orange On the much larger. You're looking at the bottom of big planet seru That whole big circular area all the way it's where it says seru arrival Is the top of the planet and the bottom of course is the is the bottom ring And you will see that in the other uh photographs when she brings them up and Apparently we're having issues with the internet Hope you can all still hear me and i'm not skipping out But we do try and when we give out too much information Sometimes we get stopped or they start messing with us or you know, go get more donuts. We're gonna get boring from here I I swear and you know a new cup of coffee speaking of which Time for a sip Ah The old sip of yeah ice cold coffee So um still waiting for rebecca's return Record off camera, but she's still with us. Okay. Well, yeah, she's still running the thing But uh, she patched out and I couldn't hear what she was saying. She was glitching out to me. It could be me So anyway while we're waiting, um, you know, let's all hum. No, um I know we'll play ave maria. I'm joking. Uh, uh All right Anybody who's been watching pop politics with perhaps I can't think of any other reason. Sorry That's okay Take care of something. All right. I'm back Okay Um, that's the same. Oh, here's this one. Are we still on theory? I'm sorry. Yeah, I probably changed it Right now. Yeah, no, I was you know trying to think of a joke even and I I couldn't even think of any jokes Oh, no. Yeah Well, sorry I want to Well, here's the other one you sent me That one Yeah, now that is That's the big bass cloud bass cloud of seru in the early years. This is like 2011. Yeah Oh Yeah It's It's very orange and very regular And some people all go oh, it's the super so super so not like this super so don't glow like this one does So from Nicole it was just one picture. Is that right? Sam or no, uh a video and a picture Oh a video. Okay. I don't see that yet. Oh here little video And a grainy and yet it shows what it shows and then she shows you a still capture of of said same Okay, I will get it and we'll see it together copy Hi, all right. Hmm glasses are crooked. All right Uh, let me get it. My brain is crooked Oh my gosh And this fun Yeah, I I I watched uh earnest P world halloween here recently so I of course uh Off there doing them strange voices again, you know, love the man great actor And uh jim barny or something I think his name was I should have memorized it. It's such a great actor. I should memorize his name The guy it did what was he doing? Ernest P world Ernest camp Ernest goes to school Ernest halloween Ernest yeah Ernest that's right TV commercials for sprite and seven up and all of this and You know different local bakeries and you name it great great actor Uh, uh, he of course has passed on since Almost 70s on it. I he did a uh He did a great walter brennan. I think one of the best walter brennans. I've ever heard he did a great john wane he did unbelievable uh satire that nobody else touched not even robin williams did as well in certain things that he did He outdid robin williams in certain ways Anyway, go watch you're you know Ernest halloween Ernest goes camp Ernest goes to school. Yeah I definitely remember Now that you yeah Well, you know the kids are going You know, it's almost halloween and so the youtube is full of nothing but halloween programs. So I've you know In the troll the troll bookers and all of that. No, so I've unfortunately unfortunately You uh side shows You distract me from this crazy world passing planets Am I No, that's not easy lately. I'm not even in finding the joy in my my older Documentary about roam or any of the other stuff anymore. It's just sort of And I weigh I want to see nirvana stuff and I can't even enjoy an et video anymore because you know These guys are talking about extraterrestrials and is nasa lying to us about this They've all lost their meaning because we know better. We know that they're here And anybody else is just talking about their noses And we have you can't stand to listen to it. You can't stand. I can't I'm like, well, you know the truth And you know that they're just making stuff up or speculating acting like they know, you know, they're trying to sell coffee You get their money and you know, so and they oh, I wrote a book you're let me you know Yeah, I want to read 800 pages of crap. Thank you um I I most of you guys are probably too young to know what the movie or the the book stutz turkerel Stutt that came talk stutz turkle working and I was forced to read that in school and that god That was one of the dumbest books I've ever read in my life about working um Jim Carrey was great too, but yeah, Jim Carrey is very troubled niece He's got some answers Although he's mixing them with other things but anyway, but if you're hollywood jet said I suppose you'd have to have that Uh, he has luxuries. I don't have but uh, I have luxuries. He doesn't I'm not gonna say all right Yeah Uh, I got the video. I'm sending it to the computer now. So we having it in a second Um, I mean, I just know you can't get to that level of fame Without being you know, and that when you're that it's hard to trust anything coming from them. Oh, yeah, yeah Well, yeah hollywood. You know, I had the opportunity I had the opportunity to move hollywood. I had I had a Colombia recording artist contract offered to me Quite a quite a deal of money per week even But I didn't know how long it would last, you know I mean I I could be uprooted and be there for a month and then Be sent home. So I you know, it was only you know, it was an outable contract But and then I went down and started walking at hollywood billvard and I went no, thank you And you know capital records and all of that it's downtown hollywood and I was not wanting to live in that environment because Hey, the money that they were giving was great for Montana money, but for down there that was barely get by money Oh, so I you know it turned it to you know after being down there long enough to see that the money that I was being offered wasn't really that good of an offer And not only that I what were you gonna be doing? I was gonna do it back up singing uh for columbia singing. Oh, that's right. Yeah And I yeah, I And I got referred to from one of my old band members from one of my mini bands that I was in And uh, they they they contacted me and they wanted to use me and they gave me a contract offer And I also had my son at the time and and then I was pretty much a primary caregiver at the time because His mother was traveling a lot and working a lot. So I was taking care of the kid And then I turned down the offer and then within a few months even the kid was gone and she took off with him. So Uh, that was another long sad story that I went through with my son. But anyway, that was the 90s, right? I feel like some of us have had Way more difficult lives than a lot of people Yeah, I have I have a And and and a couple of sci-fi way more my life. Yeah I mean healthy the adoption story alone doesn't make any sense Right, I don't have that but I have enough Look at that. That's pretty cool. I mean Plus what I said quest for magic all these other stories in my life look them up with and The things we all go through and you know the teenage years and you know And then that school day, okay, you know, you could I I could write a few memoirs memoirs, but I mean where do you begin? Not only that, you know, I don't want to have them used against me I've hesitated people have asked for a book and I've hesitated writing one The kids aren't old enough yet and when they're when they're old enough and in this different story That's that There are other people out writing books about me, but they're not publishing Because they run into snags And I don't blame them for a second. I know this it's impossible It's an impossible story to share and like I said, I've got at least two or three sci-fi Eyes under my belt, you know, it's my life right now you do every time Like all the times we've talked I would be thinking that in my head like it this sounds like a movie This would make a great movie. You know, I would be thinking that yeah, yeah, really so hey It happened Uh, there's an it was still shot. That might be better to easier to see Yeah, uh before the uh before the thyroid cancer surgery. I could sing a lot better than I can now I have trouble talking now Um And I you know, they told me before they put me under there was a 50 chance that I would never even speak again So I was like, oh god, thank you and this is like two minutes right before they, you know, wheelie into the operating room They've already given you the magic juice. You're dizzy as hell and the guy goes Oh, I feel I must inform you there's a 50 chance that you won't ever be able to speak again And it's like and you know, so I looked out. I this way I have gruff right gravelly voice sometimes after uh First and 29 minutes of talking Yeah, look at that. I see two star destroyers because those are two upper dots are triangles I looked at them big on my screen here and the bottom one is a landercraft A disc that is the bottom one in a disc A disc Yeah, it's like a flying saucer. Yeah, it's a flying saucer disc. It's not a tube Because they're it occupies don't see every band of those Here's a there's a there's a little kish aurora on the top of it that the tube doesn't have So this is a closer uh landing disc And they the landers would actually fly up to the star destroyers and land on them inside them Just like in the star wars movies Go up from underneath of them then parking in the big hangar deck and then the doors closed You know Yeah, you got a lander and two and two star destroyers I wonder how big they are not in there. That's mine huge A third one a third light on that. There's a fourth one And there's other blobs of colors. I'm looking at the directories. There's all kinds of stuff in here A little nuance. See pictures of dream light. Yeah Yeah, that's sure you can you can tell if the kids were affiliated with this those are definitely et craft Needs yeah Cool picture go back to normal screen. I need to get out and look at nighttime sky. I don't Yeah, I don't often enough either and of course it's cold already And I don't go hanging out in the cold or and you know, I have an unfortunate situation All right, we have Missoula lighting and Missoula is very very bright And so literally the entire north sky is robbed from me Right And so I'd have I'd have east and south because the west is pretty much mountainous I have low. I have low low peak to my southwest And so I can look up but not out Anyway Huh Right, that sounds nice though. I mean I live two miles. Well, uh, let's the two miles from downtown I'm like really close to downtown. So you have a level of light pollution because you are in town So you're looking up. Yes, you'd probably be amazed, you know, I have not seen any stars lately hardly at all again That means the planets are over the top of us and in the middle of the view and and I haven't seen Orion and of course the Uriah needed a meteor shower, which is supposedly still going on And I have not gone out to look and I should And uh, I should forget about the light blindness or the solar or the the solar pollution that are towns and streetlights put up Anyway, and we have to of course keep looking for the second star Was that a was that it was that that sounded like a an um that we wanted to go someplace with No, no, are you running out of things to do? I know I was looking at my list of what I'd done or not then but or what I'd yeah We're good. Whatever you want to do Sam. I mean it is five hours 32 minutes So I don't know what happened to Christopher. Maybe he had to go. I don't know Maybe his phone died I don't know if he said anything Quite a while to go there That's true. Yeah, right. He's still on his journey. Okay. I just didn't want to miss him if I was On the lookout for him. Uh, Tara says can you show my Tara and two sons? That's right Tara. I'm glad you reminded me. Um Let me get that video. Also. I have a slideshow of pictures that she sent me I almost forgot Tara. Sorry Let me um Turn my music down so we can Pull her video. Uh, you're hearing any music Oh I hear it I don't have a lot Well, I turned it off just a second ago Now you don't hear your hang off And this video just has your pictures, Tara, and then I'll get the two sons clip and we'll do that next Okay I'm not tired. I'm just running out of voice. That's all I hear it. I know what you're saying I've got one ricola left. Oh, no. Oh my gosh Well, we're wrapping up after Tara's death Oh, I you know, I still I'm still good for oh It's more than a fact. I have half of the other one still left that was sitting on the deck didn't even see it So I can I can just grab this ricola. I'm fine You know, I I don't keep them in my mouth the whole way. I you know, I I'll pop them out put them on I got this as needed piece of marble That's a little disc of marble that I put it on and only that goes on that so I do I do wash it regularly Right and that's my little parking space for cough drops That sounds like something I would do honestly when you I mean, I feel like there's nothing wrong with that at all Well, you don't want to stick it on the on the countertop And you don't want to put on a coffee coaster because then your coffee cup gets stuck to your coffee coaster And you don't want to stick it on your pop can Because the pop can top is dirty unless you've washed it off You don't want to stick it on your computer or your keyboard So I have this little marble sliced disc that someone sent me and uh It's it's you know, it's a worry stone. It's home sized right And it's smaller than a coaster. So I just put my cough drops on it It's perfect, you know, I was sitting there. It's it's something, you know, you're worried stone. You're supposed to rub in your hands or whatever And uh, it's a little it's got flat edges. It's not smooth and round and lumpy, but it's it is smooth straight square cut disc circle And I think it's always sitting on the desk in front of me here and I was looking for where am I going to put this Cough drop, you know, it's like I don't want to put you on it anymore I'm trying to talk and you get the sound of my mouth and I went oh perfect. And that's you know Star is born from then on Yeah, look at that illumination right there That is one of the acid that's that same illusion illumination we talked to when chrisper was showing live There was an illuminated my single micro asteroid and that's that same illuminated asteroid As he saw live just a few minutes ago This is uh, oh boy, this is most likely seru over the sun after sunrise We've been seeing that a lot. That's just like christophers. He's had clouds and whatnot, but otherwise That's very much like what he just showed us There's sort of a green blue to it. There you go How many pictures was there I was talking about being attention I know you well let's start over it's not long going two minutes. Okay. I apologize if everybody goes Oh, we don't want to see it again. I I was currently talking we were talking about cough drops Yeah, yeah, you're right. Yeah I lost track. Oh god Hey, I remember now we were Sun had been down 20 to 30 minutes now that dark object on the left at sunrush sunset A seru in the city Yuri and seru Nepecities above and to the right not to the left At sunset, okay Up there. Yeah up there right. Yeah That right there that is the side of that this is satum's yellow moon and this satum on the right hand side Yeah And I love it. I love it. It's like drawing That is the shadows. No that that's Yuri is the dark left corner Now that white dot could either be the moon Or could be one of the asteroids illuminated the one that christopher got a week ago It was really big and very illuminated That could be that or could be extra the moon or or any number of things Or it could be the spiral asteroid the size is right the horizon is right You know, I can't absolutely Be the moon. I don't normally see the moon that I I don't know Yeah, I'd have to have been there to actually call it but that's definitely Right And this of course and here's another example of the red out of the sun. Oh, Tara said it's a street light Thank you, Tara street light Hi, chris. Oh the street light. Okay. Hey guys Uh-huh These are pics from Tara. Oh That looks like the red asteroid going in front of the sun. You sent me pics too Chris, do you want to send me anything else? I don't I don't she's in texas. It'll take me a while to find all that stuff. He does look that okay I got the ones you sent me and we'll show those. Uh-huh Wow Yeah, no, there is a there is a flourished Um To the left of the sun there's the blue blip which could be lens flare non-lens flare. I don't know And there also could be a backlit crescent flare of the lead asteroid on that previous picture This does look like the lead asteroid coming in There again, there's that flare illumination that you saw In your live christopher This evening that area that dot was illuminated. Wasn't it same spot? Yep exact same thing. Look at that. Wow And that is likely to be seru in the back above the sun And the rounding edge would be sort of like a base cloud angled light And the inner core is the orange And we lost christopher again Thank you Tara Okay, and then here is her I think it's tarah. No, sarah. Tara. I don't know. Why is it tarra? You said? It's like sarah. Right Right. Okay, and here is her picture her video of it We believe it's two suns. I think this is her second or third Capture now She's like on a mission I'm not sure if I'm on a mission to I honestly, that's a big I can't think of a better prospect for you know, uh huh. You'd be Yeah, you got two locations. There are there are two lens flares there. Ah Question is would it be that small or does she have the blue asteroid Yeah In the upper right corner, would our star be that small? Wow, would it be? I mean look at that. No, it wouldn't be but you know if it's that close to view is it being outshined and how big is the actual star? Because we're seeing this a very large flare and look at the size of that. Yeah And she's in Texas and it's that big. Now the farther south you go, the bigger the sun does appear. I learned that the first time I went to Mexico and California. Sure It's a whole lot smaller up here in Montana. The upper right looks kind of cut off too. Yeah, yeah, yeah that that blip that white blip is it's definitely there because it moves along. With it doesn't change with the series. Right It's definitely there. Now question is is it the second sun being outshined? It's way small to be the second sun or is it the blue asteroid? Because that's about the right size for the asteroid. Let me blow it up another one here and see if there's a facial to it. I don't see a facial but yeah it's a little small to be the second star. It could be because it could still be being outshined and we do not know how big this real star in the center as I said before. Now the actual star of what we're looking at here is because it could be a cut off enlarged flare as well from right or left or both. So yeah, thank you. It's very good that you caught that. It's one of those two. It's definitely not normal. It's not one of our regular planets either. Well it could be because there are four regular planets on the other side of the sun but I'm not seeing that bright. It's hard. It's a few pics to Chris. So we don't know if it's an asteroid or a sun. Is that what we're saying? Right. It's either a blue asteroid or it is the same but it is definitely a illuminated smaller object to the light of the sun. It is not a... Yes. I wanted to pull Tara her video from last week. She had a two sun video. Lens flare. Because it moved lips in the lens flare. So it tells us there are two objects. This was a lens flare. Now that was last week. Is this the same thing? Wow. It is in the same spot isn't it? Uh huh. Wow. You know I wonder... See that. See. I wonder... Something. I can't imagine that soul would be farther away than it used to be. We still have to have our holder placement but our system is not breaking up. So you know... That's what makes all of this hard. If you don't see it for yourself, by yourself when you're standing outside and actually watching. Sometimes it's really difficult to make a summation. You can have some position but not summation. Right Tara. Yeah. I think... I don't know if... Sam are you having like second thoughts maybe? No I'm still... This is why we haven't completely called the second part. You know they're separating. We don't have... We're up to six or seven examples of it. By the time we get to ten or twelve, I will have a better definition of it. Because then we'll have more examples. And this is why... I mean look... God we talked about the planet names from year two and a half to literally year three and a half. Literally we talked about the planet names for over a year. Before we even settled that yeah okay we're gonna call them that. You know because I knew the names ahead of time. But then we were calling all the purple planet or the striped planet. You know Uri. The striped planet and the blue planet and the blue green planet. And the red planet and the little green planet. And they all matched and we went literally a year or longer knowing the names. But never being able to attribute it without more proof. And then once we saw purple planet had to come in and it matched everything else. It was like oh god that we just have to. And so we finally named the planets. Because we didn't want to jump across that board thinking that we're all kink shit and everything. And we knew what we were doing until we actually proved it. And well over a year of watching it and debating it with new members and old members. And we finally you know we went with names we've never looked back since. And they are active. And they are from you know the Pleiadian message. So it's not something we didn't make up the names. It was a hand and me down from the internet going all the way back to 2008. So and it's stuck and you know I'm not going to call him Harrington and all the other crazy shit that other scientists attributed. Which was just a way for them to mask the whole thing in a fake name. So nobody would know what they were talking about. By renaming the planets after themselves. Which I didn't want to do and I didn't want to be aerated. Oh look planet Hoffman you know. And the moon Sam you know. Let me see if this one's it. That's not it. Okay she's asking me if I have a. Okay there's another. I'll look to Lensler. Further back slide. I'm looking. Let me try to get. That's telling us there's two definitely two objects there. Why isn't the other lens flare bigger which is weird. You know you can't do all the science and have all the answers but yeah there's that's definitely an object illuminated above on the right hand side. Which would be very strange. Not it. And are we are we are we that confused are we really forgotten the size of our son. Yeah. Is so that small. I mean wow. And then the standard red. Larger star. Is the standard red even bigger getting closer to us is it like 80 million miles or 75 million miles away from us. You know I mean that's my fear. Because right now if it is leaving. Why is it on the left hand side of our son. Because if it was leaving it should be on the right hand side of our son. Which causes me a level of concern. We don't know where it's going to go. We've never seen it. There it is. This is that same video but further back. Yeah there's definitely an illuminated object to the upper right. Wow. Because I've got it I've got on a large screen right now. Yeah. Keep watching this. Tara thank you. This is six or seven and you know we watch this. We got to keep watching it. And then you know again if they separate farther apart from each other then we'll get a better idea. Right. So we've got to just continue to watch what's going on and do you keep doing what you're doing. You're doing a great job. Yeah. And yes it is really hard to get this shit through clouds. She said between eleven and one seems to be a prime time for this. Oh yeah that's because that's when you're going to have the highest arc and direct overheadness. And I would look before dawn if the sun is going to come up and then you might see the smaller one first. Yeah. Then then crack of dawn it goes across the horizon depending on where you live if you have mountains in the way it takes longer. And the other one might come up first and then you see the smaller one by itself and then the larger sun come up and then that will of course over illuminate. So who knows. This is all part of the game where we got to just keep watching and keep watching and keep watching and and compare our notes and take more videos and more captures. And and yeah look at that. That is very definitely illuminated. And it's not asteroid illuminated. It's really bright. So you know and then we have not talked about the tool star. Huh. There's something we didn't talk about in a long time. Oh. Yeah. I don't hear about the tool star. I mean that was back when I first started your grave. That was something that was talked about often. You know it was this little blue dot wasn't it. Just a little blue dot. Oh right. Right. Very intensely. Yeah. Brighter than anything out there. Well. But yeah it always puts off the intense shaft lighting. Is it a I can't remember is it a moon or a craft. No it's not a mini it's a mini it's a mini being or or man made created star. What. Wow. Yeah. Yeah it's a technology. It's it's it's adhered the outer proximity of Nibiru proper. It's a technological star that was created as a mini star and they use that stay connected to their star so they don't go behind Imaru and hit an ice age. Wow. Because they they control this is part of their technology they control their placement in the in the binary solar system with this mini tool star. It's a direct miniature star thread connection to their star which keeps them in more controlled proper placement. Wow. Yeah. Beyond that I don't have the knowledge of that but that's what I know. And I don't know how I know it. I just know it. I know it. I wonder how old it is like you think well there's no way of telling I know but. Well you know I I talk about when you start from the same thing on what's inside the Ark of the Covenant. Remember in some of the pictures from the Bible you see them opening a lid and there's a big bright intensely large flare of light that comes out of what if they put a mini star in there a little contained start micro cosmic star. And that power alone would put off an air an aura of healing any number of powers if you could focus in on that energy. And I've often believed that inside the Ark of the Covenant was a tiny mini star. That's just one of my little quirks you can you can laugh all you want but. No it's nothing to laugh at I don't think. I've always believed that there's a micro mini star inside the Ark of the Covenant. And I can't elaborate more on that. That makes sense because in Raiders of the Lost Ark you know when they opened the Ark it was so bright like the white this white light was emitting from the Ark and all these like. Well you know that girl lady that wrote about the Ark as well. When I when we did our 1997 Hopi Indian sojourn to Holland Lake to do Haley's Comet captures of spirits when we saw all those thousands of ghosts on that on that rising of whatever was going on with all those spirits we saw thousands and thousands and thousands of. Right. I got the scary ladies on that rose up out of the Ark of the Covenant where that looks beautiful she's beautiful and then it turns into this vampiric all thing. That is literally some of the stuff that we saw when we went to the lake and saw all of those ghosts and I'm telling you there's there's so much more to the cosmos and spirits and humans and alien races and our you know our having a soul and all of this and being collected and recycled and all there's so much more going on and it just I mean people should have the greatest of hope that they are something of way more cosmic connection than you you've been dreamt of there's way more to it way more to what's going on and I think everybody should believe in the best right now not the worst don't go to the scary do the do the best of possibilities and and shoot for the moon really seriously you know shoot for the moon because you can be whatever you choose to be you just have to believe and it's like what we do I mean we see these planets because we believe not because we chose to because we developed it going oh my god what's that oh my god what's that look at how dark that is how come the sky looks so scurry what is going on what am I looking at and then of course all of us getting together and comparing notes and 14 years later here we of course I knew they were coming that's probably why I saw them easier than everyone is expected I had a level of expectation so and then when I was on bang there it is it's like oh shit they're here or if you hadn't heard that the planets were coming and your average Joe in the 70s anybody that was reading Isaac Asimov or you know following any of the sciences or Einstein or any of this stuff that was in publication way back in the 70s they knew that planet X was coming everybody knew it it was you know common knowledge and so and and then of course as far as why I wrote my paper going well we have to have two sons and that wasn't common knowledge everybody believe you know planet X was this dark rogue planet traveling in the dark by itself but you can't have that if you're going to have a civilization that lives on that and this is of course the Anunnaki and they have they have a civilization long-term technological live for thousands of years well they have to have their own star they're not hiding away from ours and coming back in to get warm oh damn it's been cold out there for 3,000 hundred years yeah we finally got 70 degrees you know they have their own star their own solar system multiple planets like you get a binary work out it all fits it all fits it all fits there isn't one part of this that does not fit and that's why we know it's the truth yeah well you can see it for starters yeah hi thunder but you can see it I mean that is more than a lot of people offer a lot of people just offer these ideas if they tell you stories yeah you know that you can't really prove at all it's just and people eat it up you know but they don't have anything to go off and here we are here we are you're talking about nah not possible how about you know that well you know we're telling you facts that we you know we fizzled out of stone because we don't just pick them like flowers we actually you know carve that rock into the reality of fact because I mean like an example is you know we've got six or eight or however many sightings of the two suns separating and it's only a supposition still until we get more proof here is not Tara also sent me this video and it's an orb okay it's a glowing love or okay and then it's also behind after that clip is some clips that JD Martinez has taken and sent me and I see you know there's several orb videos out there like this but JD's is the only one I've seen that our daytime most people catch them at night so anyway here we go cool this is happening more and more I think that's the same one that we were viewing earlier it's well that was from Alexander right this is from Tara right the same thing yeah blue asteroid cool okay it is okay probably the blue asteroid but see this is totally different ID can't use that trees wow is that is that a car on the other side of the trees well I hope it's a little bit bigger that looks better me oh okay I zoomed in on that really hard changes color now there are orbs that are are like drones which are reconnaissance orbs and then there's big attack drone orbs from from the ETS and then there are spirit orbs which are different paranormal I don't know I mean I think I think yeah the regular I can read look at the regular footage again so I was I think I was looking at it I'll send you a copy of this Sam too okay now I get a better I blew it up too it's a better view of it huh yeah that looks like a paranormal orb huh because the shape a regular orb doesn't change you sent me a few clips I haven't got them all put together yet so I'm gonna make a video out of all that you sent me yeah there are God it's amazing what you know orbs can you can watch a paranormal orb and it'll go across the parking lot for example this is why I talk about slap-tam on YouTube type in slap-tam and they he does the best there's a bunch of other people out there too so um that's terrorist again you can watch an orb crossing yeah crossing the parking lot and sometimes you see the shape of the skull and because the orbs are usually right where the skull is and then you saw see all of a sudden the formation of the spine and then the rib cage and then the arms and then the hips and then the legs and then they vary into then you all of a sudden see the meat around them and then all of a sudden and not two more steps and they'll turn back into an orb and you see transitory examples of them as they move and usually most spirits move really quick when you get a big orb you've got a ghost when you got a small orb you might have a micro ghost or a less for a weaker ghost it's dark outside where Christopher is okay Tara I got the wrong one she could okay rescind it you sent it okay why did I get that one thinking it was yours I'm wondering who that was now we'll get it straight to me it's like the one we thought was there's no wasn't it's like more mechanical looking and the other one is like Sam says it's like paranormal right it's like yeah colors are blending together it's just the population is getting larger smaller larger smaller a an actual reconnaissance orb sent in technological an actual tech orb which is a robot doesn't change shape they stay the same size they may change color but they stay the same size I got I have hers now and hers is almost like the one I just showed you it's like almost identical so I bet you it's that asteroid again we're gonna find out yeah other people will we will have multiple sightings around the world yeah and it does roll and it does tumble and it does put up different colors just because we call it the red asteroid or the blue asteroid or the green asteroid doesn't always mean it's that color sometimes they're yellow and very eliminated sometimes they're you know dark and and then we see the facial markings and we know what they look like because we know what the shape of the red asteroid is we know about the weird multiple almost virus like look to the green asteroid and only after the green asteroid got close enough did we understand why because it's got a shitload of small asteroids with it and I never in my wildest dreams even assumed that because for years we'd watched it and it just looked like very illuminated little weird dots outside of something that you know like a tinker toy set or something that you would draw in a cartoon of space but it turns out those dots were all those other smaller micro asteroids around it who knew who knew amazing and I see it now more than I did than I used to even just looking in the sky I go oh I see it well there's the little dots yep that's green asteroid and it makes more sense now but I sat there you know you go back to any of the old shows and I went for the life of me I can't tell you why it looks the way it does because it sure looks weird to me and it's not you know not like any of the other asteroids and finally this year we got close enough that we can actually tell it it's a whole bunch of micro asteroids around it awesome awesome who knew right um I yes Nicole we did I played a hey let me fix let me fix it a second because I did play a screenshot of your video but let me change one thing on it and we'll show it again okay she missed getting to see it so but here is the orb from Tara sending it to the computer and um I have a feeling Samsung say it's an asteroid but we'll see I don't know I'm not an expert I'm not an orb expert well I'm you know I'm not an expert either but I mean we've been staring at this stuff for so many years now and the trick is to break it down logically you know talk to yourself out loud even if you guys weren't here on on the microphone I'd be saying this stuff out loud to me well it doesn't look like this but it does look like this and it could be this and it could be that and if you talk for about two and a half minutes to probably come to a conclusion this that's viable although boy look at that this one does not have the same facial there's no central blip you can see that Tara wow and there's nobody else around it did it look like it was moving any certain direction or was it idle Tara yeah let's see well it doesn't have the the the uh the a it's not big enough to be the empire orb um uh it doesn't have the okay now we got a house edge okay look at that that shows us how elevated it is off the deck um at that angle this could easily be the spiral asteroid and that little back trail white illuminated eddy behind it could be the secondary object behind the spiral because at the angle if this is the house eve and she's standing on the street she's filming and that angle of up angle view is only you know 14 15% which shows us this is close off the horizon so this could easily be the spiral asteroid it's interesting that was that white square that just went by there a couple of weeks ago asteroid okay yeah asteroid asteroid I don't see craft markings I don't see it looks like it's moving did she say oh it moved it it did it did it look like the left or left right it looks like it's going to her left if it went to the left that would not be the the spiral asteroid because the spiral asteroid comes from her left to right let's play back see how she and this could be a very distant empire orb or a regular uh flying ship orb it's going behind the building yeah okay a track an attack drone orb maybe uh they have the left in them right to this left okay yeah then that is it's probably that's a techno orb because asteroids go from left to right what is that oh just a a techno orb a recon uh it's a larger orb it's about the size of your desk you know a very large ball and some of them have machinery and some of them have different cameras and all kinds of tech gear I was getting saved that's what her base is it's not driven by anybody they're robotic that's how they can turn a corner at 17 and not kill the occupant inside because there's no occupant inside these are their drones they're mechanical robot drones there's big ones and there are small ones small ones are mainly recon but the big one could actually if they wanted to they could probably shoot a ship out of the sky or an airplane or whatever if they wanted to I'm sure they have the tech they have unbelievable tech that's way advanced compared to ours okay here's the video I forgot it was me okay but this is the video of the coal that she sent in right and that looks like a lander see the top and see the bottom there's a there's a warble in color that blue it's nice not a tube that's like a disk with a little you know ET you know normal little green guys inside picture yeah that looks like a disk and the discs are landers they come out of the big Star Wars craft and there's a couple of them in the overall secondary picture they're back there and it's of course a hard call because this is blurry but that is generically right yeah this is your better example of this yeah the disk and then two star destroyers because if you blow those up those are actually triangular and the one in the middle is disc shaped with a top and a bottom in the middle and not a space tube because the tube the ends of the tube are way more defined as well in the space tube both ends are usually defined and this is not this is blurry on both ends so just a very very distant flying saucer right flying saucer that's yeah that was the word I was looking for and those are landers those are small things that way they can park them and get out of them and I've been on one of those I'd go inside oh man when I was on had two decks the lower one was the medical deck and then the and then where they kept the prisoners and then the upper deck is the control oh here he is there he is control room there was a lady on tiktok who was showing on her back like in the middle of her back sort of was just a little hole like the size of the tip of a pencil maybe like you know but it was just a no redness or nothing but just a tiny hole in her back I don't know for some reason I got to thinking like could that be some you know remainder remainder of a test well what they do I don't know do they leave marks and stuff like that oh god you know I you know they can open you from stem to stern and then seal your skin back up with like spray dermis skin or whatever yeah no scar there's a minor scar um if you if if I take a shower and see I have I have a pretty mostly hairy chest I apologize ladies um if I take a shower and my stomach hair and chest hair is still wet and you get that little straight line down your you know just in your belly um just to the right of mine it's this big white area where no air grows from neck to belly button that's from an incision for sure yeah implant now those small micro holes when they jam when they when they jam the if they're trying to tag you they're trying to put a foreign body inside your body and the body will reject it and bump it out or get infected or whatever so they jam and they while you're on the table you're laying there you're you're not moving and ET is examining you and taking blood samples and fingernail and hair samples and looking at your teeth and seeing how you know how you are looking at your joints and you know if you're seeing if you're arthritic or whatever uh judging the age of the patient blah blah blah you know forensic examination and they want to tag you they will they'll pick up the adapter and it's about the size of oh like an electric toothbrush without the actual toothbrush part on it but the handle it's about the size of a tube of toothpaste small tube of toothpaste or whatever and they jam that thing into your leg it cauterizes a bite out of your skin wraps your skin around the the metal uh computer chip twisted wire locator tag they got micro high tech rainbow etching with computer diodes and rainbow etching laser laser made on on micro scale anyway then they insert that in any number of places in your body behind your ears up your nose other places we don't want to mention and that way when they insert it it's already wrapped in your skin that way your body won't reject it wow smart and that is a cauterizing grab it bites out and leaves a teardrop shape small a little bit smaller than the head of an eraser usually on your left leg that never tans and it looks like the size of a teardrop one pointed edge and a rounded edge on the other side and if you have a never ending spot on your left leg or right leg or arm or whatever that absolutely absolutely never tans but yet is always the same shape then you'll know that that's a mark now there are different skin anomalies that will do similar things to that but it's that one for sure that has an absolute teardrop shape it's about you know smaller than a quarter inch and that's what the mark looks like hmm okay well I don't know what happened to that one lady but I not well you know maybe she had a skin deformity that left a crater and you know or it's entirely possible if it's teardrop shaped they could have taken a sample from there skin sample wrap around the tag and then or insert the tag there or inner ears or behind her ears or inner nose or any other other places armpit orifices etc and sometimes they'd change that too though I would imagine yeah I I I found mine or one of mine and this is where I had removed it with an exacto knife and I didn't yeah I didn't do that I didn't get away with the first time I I had to go after it a few times and then when you get it sore and then it gets all sore and then you rip the scab off then you have an entry and that's what I did and I ended up feeling that I because I cut at it and I thought what the hell is that thing it's just there it's under my skin what's it mean it's moving around and so I started picking at it picking at it and then it got sore then I removed the scab and then I was feeling the metal tip at the end of it I thought what the hell is that so I went out and got them I got the tweezers and a mirror so I could see what the hell I was grabbing and I mean I had a mirror here a mirror here and a mirror here all trying to see you know back by my own head and I grabbed hold of it pulled it out pulled the mung mung off of it and I'm looking at two different colored wires there was a copper wire and a silver wire and they were twisted together and I looked at it with a magnifying glass and here was all these microscopic laser etching in rainbow like micro keyboard micro chip board in rainbow microscopic laser etching and I stared at it for about four or five minutes and then while I'm sitting here you know looking at it with the tweezers and the magnifying glass it vaporized right from my very eyes what? yeah oh boy that's crazy oh it was exposed to oxygen for a period of time okay and then went pshhh little smoke and gone watched it happen wow that is cool and I not watched it happen I would have thought I dropped it but I actually watched it turn bright red smoke and then vanish in the tweezers that's wild thank you Nicole thank you that's awesome that's type of that but I love it that's my lucky number you know and I try to give you guys these full stories and you know yes it can make me look like a you know crazy idiot but um and I you know that's the ET thing where I even said yeah I come off as a nut job but no these are as honest and factual stories as I can share I have no reason to create or make up these stories because I'm not selling books currently you know I mean going on good but you know I've told that story over and over again anyway to other people in other shows but um I do try to share the truth and not embellish too much and sometimes I hold stuff back more than handing it out but anyway I digress into soleneness just thank you awesome yeah awesome 888 I love it that's incredible well incredible it was hearing from the Piedean that I was going to be doing all of this crazy shit and you know I said this couple shows ago it's like I'm the only one doing this and it's like I am the only one doing this and so that matches the information that I was told you know 30 years ago that you know because of my abilities you know I don't even know what those really are and you talk about you know farce and remote viewing and all of that to me it's just it's a normal natural thing for me to sit down and draw what's in my head and yet it's not like I sit down and go oh okay you know shake the beads and light the incense and dance around in circles and do the rain dance and create remote viewing or farce seeing abilities it's just innate and natural and I sit down I prepare myself I relax I have a cup of tea you know get calm pull out the paper grab my shapes you know my bowl my my platter my dinner plate and my peanut butter jar lid and a couple of I'll get some smaller stuff like a spice jar lid or something and then I sit down and draw what I see in my head and that's how it works it's just that simple you get something in your head and you draw it and I guess you know I am I am focused on it all week long right and I do you know and I do dread every 15th of the month about three days ahead of time I go oh god I gotta pay attention I guess daddy gotta do my homework you know gotta do this right can't be wrong can't be wrong and I have made minor mistakes in in the last decade but nothing that I could really say okay I have to recall that picture I throw that away until everybody don't look at this you know no I've been mostly accurate all these years and and that's where I go okay yeah nobody can do this because I've done the time I know the shapes I know the patterns I've studied this in other ways that nobody else could and I mean nobody nobody can touch the amount of hours that I've worked on because I've been going up for 44 years plus years ever since 1980 1978 you know and I didn't fully know everything in 1978 I didn't fully know everything in 1980 I didn't fully know everything in 2008 I didn't fully know everything in 2015 or I don't fully know everything today I don't but the information that we have gathered it's priceless irreplaceable yeah it is it's awesome it's the coolest show that ever was and I will keep telling this until the day I die and you're gonna go all that crazy old man laying in his bed you know taking his last breath he's still talking about frickin never that's just it that's why we tell people is how your story has never changed you know it's very consistent it's not like you you know switch around and add or take away you know oh this is over here and I was wrong yeah trying things ever yeah we haven't had we haven't had to do any major I've done minor corrections when I make a mistake I'll post a correction but we haven't done any of that really not in years generic this is the part I love the best is you know the return of the Saturn, the Saturn, the moon and that ion tail off as it says you know that's like you can't argue with that and it's like and it's the only thing in the sky right there doing that you know ever since 2019 and it's on its way back it's like oh you know and even when it was going over the sun in 2017-2018 and all of that crazy crap happened and everybody's going oh it's winged Nibiru, Nibiru the destroyer and I was going oh come on you know and we went through hell on earth over the Saturn and the Saturn, the moon trying to get everybody to listen to know the red it catches the an that planet with the wings is the Saturn, the Saturn yeah I clipped out there I think right yeah we you know it was the only thing that that fell into place and everything was it just all fell into place and everything was collected and collected and it fit and it fit and it fit and it fit and here we are 14 years later and it still fits and it's still the most awesome show ever was there's nothing cooler than this although the double telescope pictures and the new telescope pictures are really cool and we are learning a lot off of that and it's got Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 oh my god they're still learning shit and they're going oh maybe we were wrong as Voyager 2 has seriously left our solar system incredible incredible and they're going past the Oort cloud out there in Iceland I mean ice meaning ice crystals at the end of our solar system there's all these ice crystals by the way that's a cell right it starts the solar system as a cell an electric cell just like skin cell I mean there's so many things to think about I mean we could be and that's what they refer to as shirt sleeve syndrome we could be in the shirt sleeve of a giant is the term behind it that's an old physics term but that's basically what the dimensions are the dimensions the smaller dimension below us is the building block of our reality and we are the building block of a larger dimension to a larger reality and all of the same rules go through all of the 144 dimensions which is by the way my math I did an equation where I found out that in my opinion with my equations I found out we have 144 dimensions wow hmm yeah I could go on and on and on yeah and then you know and then 144 variable and that number alone is a pi number and all of that pi and pie and electric and oh god you know on and on and on okay so what is in each of the dimensions like how is it different or the same I think the rules are the same I think we're a building block to a building block to a building block like the nesting dolls in Russian nesting dolls you got the smaller doll inside a bigger doll inside a bigger doll inside a bigger doll inside a bigger doll inside a bigger doll We're all connected. We're all part of the building blocks of the other dimension because people think of dimensions as a mirror dimension, but not a larger or smaller dimension. And I believe that's we are the next dimension below us is smaller than we are in the microcosm, you know, ant man and all of that the subatomic and the and the next dimension above us is the astro atomic that we're the building blocks of. And our soul is so big. It's a cell or a compound of metal or whatever soft metals group. And we're, you know, we're part of a larger connected construction of larger universe in a larger dimension. And that dimensional diversity would account for why we can't account for the Big Bang theory or quasars or black holes because a black hole would be a connection to a larger dimension or to a smaller dimension or a quasar hole or a quasar connection or or or a loop into another room. I mean, you can ponder astrophysics forever and there's no way to come up with the proper answer unless you got some guide, you know, in in some scientific think tank going, oh yeah, look at the plaque on the wall. That's mine. I have a, you know, degree and I think this other than that, that's there's no answer for us to be able to prove any of this stuff. And I've always pondered that dimensions are micro medium and larger. We're all connected. No, all that same set of rules. All of those dimensions are connected, which is what holds everything together. Why it doesn't just say which is why it's billions of years old and keeps getting bigger. And then, you know, their science is talking about, well, we don't know why space is moving out. It's moving. We never believed it was before. We thought it was static. No, it's not. It has to do with the one constant in this universe of perpetual motion. The one and only constant is heat and cold exchange. Space is cold. The Big Bang went boom. That heat is going outward. It's moving to the cold and the cold and the heat are turning places. So our solar system, our universe is always expanding because that heat, that energy will always continue outward. It never quits. So our universe get bigger and bigger and bigger. And so do our dimensions because they're all connected. Physics according to Sam or Hoffman or whatever you want to, you know, it's all speculative. I could go on and on about it, but. 140%. I'm sorry. I was just going to say they, there's this video where they took like an iPhone, Apple chip, and they get this high powered microscope. And they, you know, zoom in on it and it shows all the intricate work and then they zoom in some more. And it's just like one level after the next, just like Sam is saying with these dimensions, it's like, you know, there's one level, then there's another. And if you watch this video, it's crazy how it's, it's just this, how did we make this thing and build it like that? And there's all these layers to it. It's pretty neat. Yeah, I love my site. And watching computer generated. If you sit and watch a Fibronacci sequence, right, you're looking at dimension. It's the same and it gets bigger and bigger or smaller and smaller, which depends on which direction you're looking at the Fibronacci sequence. But I view, you know, dimensions like a Fibronacci sequence. It's a repetitive, connective pattern that no matter how deep you go in, it's the same or how far you pull out, it gets the same. And I love watching those. And I haven't seen any of them recently and I do need to drag up a couple of Fibronacci sequences. They're awesome. And you know, the sound studies and the sand, the sand sound harmonic studies. Oh, I love those too. Simatics. Yeah, yeah, yeah, just awesome stuff. Awesome stuff. And you know, that's what, you know, the star and physics sound equals light equals matter. And these patterns are formed from sounds and then we could start talking about the humming of the planets and all the, you know, the trumpet sounds from the plants when the when the planets first got here and all of that. And we didn't have any of that prior to that. We didn't have any crazy trumpet sounds in 2008 or 2005 or 1997. None of that happened. It happened when the secondary planets got here. And that's when all these harmonics sound equals light equals matter. All this crazy shit happened. Radioactive decay changed. Our light changed. Our earth tones are shoo, our human resonance changed. Our star changed. All our planets tipped. Everything changed. And to ignore it is insane. Yeah. It's like, I mean, there are so many things that are all connected to look at this, look at this. It's pointing that way. It's pointing that way. It's pointing that way. And I don't know how anybody's missing all of this and not putting it together. It blows me away. It hurts my widow head, you know. Yeah. It's, it's an incredible responsibility you have to be the only person that has this information. I'm sure my older brother is my biggest information we've ever seen. I, you know, I don't see this as a responsibility. I see it as an opinion. Okay. You know, it's just my, it's my duty to share my opinion. Right. I was told that I would have an effect on some people. Not for the wrong reasons, but for the right reasons. I don't do this to control people or to, you know, start a cult or anything like that. A cult is always the cult leaders. Number one in my case, you guys are number one in my opinion. It's the, it's the science and the members that matter. And I've, you know, I have fried my ass. The picture you're looking at up in the upper right hand corner here is a blonde Samuel Hoffman. And I looked in the mirror the other day and there's not so much blonde going on anymore. I have turned gray. I have this year. I, you know, even like six months ago, I was very blonde still blonde. Wow. I looked in the mirror the other day and went, Oh no. What happened? When this, when did this kick in? I turned gray haired recently. So you guys stop me to gray hairs. Damn it. It's all your fault. I blame you. No, I'm not. Yeah. The same year I have, my gray is all right underneath the headphones. Like right here, but my ears, you know, if I pull my hair back up, it's very white. Oh, I had myself from the side recently and then I got a picture of myself. I was, the camera was on and the computer wasn't running and I wasn't trying to post it. And I looked over and wow, my hair is gray. Holy cow. And it is, you know, it's way curly on my shoulders now. So I'm growing it back. I'm squeezing as hard as I can. All right. Cut my hair because I knew I thought I had to go to court and I didn't want to have long hair in front of the judge. And then I didn't need to go to court. I know I got my hair for no reason. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Disappointing, but you know, you do what you got to do. Right. Here's a few pictures from Christopher and he took today. Yeah. Let's wrap it up with that. Yeah. A few pictures. Perfect. Plus he's on business with a multiple. Oh, this was right after the first time I went outside. I thought maybe right above the building could be like possibly a Star Destroyer or something. What it looked like. That was cool. Yeah. There's a lot of there's asteroids there. There are several asteroids right there. Look right above the tower and the little, you know, the the antenna. There's a C upside or flat laying on his back C cloud and that is an asteroid. And then there's two or three behind it. Wow. There. Yeah. And remember we talked about this last week and the week before there's a whole bunch of new asteroids that we've never documented because they were so small before. And now they're they're a chunk of manga man. Yeah. That is the site of your with the tan asteroid. Yeah. It's so good. It's just in your face right there. You can see him crossing just like Sam draws. It's so cool. Yeah. Tan asteroid and happy. And then Lorraine is the white up toward the upper right there. Yeah. This is Fappy is the middle bottom there. And happy right there. That's in our bubble palm tree. Look at that. We are under the happy. Leander named happy. So which one? It's a it's above the. You're right. Palm tree. Oh. That's happy. Tan asteroid is over to the upper middle right. And those trails are. Yeah. Like you're drawing. Yeah. I'm going to make a comparison with that. Yes. Because it looks just like the angle is perfect that slanted. And it's always like that to the left of our son. I tell people when I'm out live, you know, on tick tock, we're always talking about left of our son, salamander group. I mentioned it all the time. And it's I tell people it's always there left of our son coming in from a slant. It would be repetitive if it wasn't something significant. If you look on the right hand side palm tree. Just a little bit above it there. There's looks like this wavy line of gray black area just to the right and headed towards the middle of the picture. Just that that blueish grayish wavy line with the white face. That's the edge of Yuri. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. So that wavy line is the definition between our stripes. Yeah. Here again. Yeah. Tan asteroid again over the left hand palm tree is happy and over to the top upper is Lorraine. And this is the bottom of at two at two moon. Yeah. The best. And the red is coming in from over the palm tree to the left. That's the red asteroid and dead center in the front is where the Texas cube and all of that crap is. If you look and kind of see a cube sitting there with a bunch of other stuff around it. Yeah. This is the other side of the parking lot. And once you get you know once you move 20 30 feet everything changes you know it's this is awesome. Yeah. And that dark blue area in the upper left the middle in this case and you can see the blue circle. That is Yuri and at two and at two moon all in the same way that bent rounded illumination come off. I was going to say. Going on there. I'm going to back it up a little bit because I saw something hang on. Yeah that look at the sun. How it's curved like that. Yeah. That's a cut off refraction. There's there's the sun is there's an object in the way. Terror read my mind. There is a lot. What is that what is that little square little white thing over the right hand palm tree. There's a tiny little square there. What kind of ship is that. That. Hmm. A little hook right in the middle of the picture on the right hand side. There's a little hook cloud going to a little square. About two inches away from the palm tree. The upper right. Yeah. It looks like a craft. Oh wow. That's really weird. Yeah. Well you have earth. I believe the humans have a spacecraft with a I have a picture of it with a back deck on it that is made for space walking where you can walk off that back deck into space walk. And I was way kind of fits that picture. I don't even know where that picture is. I have to look that up again. Kind of between the light pole and the palm tree. No. All right. No. The bar right. Yeah. Yeah. Between the light pole and the palm tree looks square and very Texas QB. The light blue. Yeah. That light blue looks like in Texas QB. Yeah. And then the dark blue above it is actually spin. It's moon and out to yeah. Yeah. There's a lot going on in this. There's a lot there isn't it. And then beside it to the left is asteroids. It's just you look up and it's just as far as you can see. You can see crap all the way as far as you can see looking upwards. Do you know between the palm tree and the light pole. Go back. Okay. Sorry. Back it up. Look at that circular cloud between the palm tree and the light pole. You see a pair of eyes and a nose. And there's your Halloween. The last right stand and dead. So it'll look right at us. Looking right at us. Between the light pole and the palm tree on the left. On the left. Oh that one. Okay. Look at the cloud circle dead center between the palm tree and the light pole. It's a skull asteroid. Wow. Okay. Yeah. I see it. Cool. When you change pictures I saw it out of the corner of my eye because I looked over the microphone and then I brought my eyes back and I went shit that's the skull staring at me. Look at that. That's cool. Okay. And here not what half an hour ago two hours ago I was going you know what I want for Halloween. I want that big damn skull to be staring at me for Halloween and there it is. You definitely saw it when I was out there. You said that's a skull asteroid and I'm like I can't tell because it's so much more bright I can't see anything. Oh this is from last week's video. You're so much there. Okay yeah that's two sightings. Yeah that's a skull. Yeah. Boy it's big. It's big. Oh god can you imagine Halloween night that sucker becoming illuminated at night over the little trick or treaters. Yeah. Using you know the red from the sathems refractive colors as well and a little bit of orange and stuff from seru and some purple and yeah look at it look it's on the left of the light pole there it is again. Yeah. That's the skull asteroid. Yes. Is it? Wow. So okay what you're talking about is just above the power lines with the little lines to one sideways. All the way to the middle of the picture. All the higher up. Yeah. I'm looking down what is that thing because there's an asteroid for sure just above the power lines because it's like those little sideways lines. Yeah but that's true. I just wondered it's what. That's a trail that's Eddie trails. The asteroid itself proper. I mean they're circular and then you don't don't pay attention to the trails. The big circular ball. Right. That's to the left of that light pole. There's a big circle right there to the left of the light pole. I see that too. Yeah. In that look for two eyes and a nose because the front of it is masked by cloud. Go back to the other picture. Yeah. Go back one picture. It's way clearer on the other picture. This one. Yeah. Do you see the skull? I think I see it. I see two eyes. And a nose. Easy. And a nose. And a nose. Right. Look carefully. Look at that. Man. That's crazy how close that is. Now do you have a copy of the real NASA release footage for all of us? Yeah. I have them to get it. I know where my copy is. Oh, I got it. If you want me to. I have it. Yeah. I have a whole folder. I want to call asteroid but if you have it go ahead. Let's get it. And of course it's in the monthly site grind too. And it's also it's right where I drew it this month on the monthly site grind also. Yeah. Except it's bigger than I do. Yeah. Happy Halloween. Wow. Yeah. There's just once you see it. I know. Right in time for Halloween. Wow. I don't know how many times I thought I saw the skull asteroid in my photos and it's never it's never it ever. It's tricky. Yeah. All right. Here we go. Because you know it is hiding between at you and Yuri. Yeah. That wasn't the yeah. There's it. No. There is on your drawing. Now let's get the NASA one here. And remember the mouth is not that predominantly visible. And in the picture on the right there is an object in front of the jaw. And that was the lead object back years ago. Wow. That's why it's black. But it's fully there. But you can't see it because there's another object in front of it that's shadowing it. But the left picture is the NASA really released footage. The right picture is also NASA released footage. And the left eye is bigger than the right eye. Wow. You know. And then the picture on now the picture on the left is facing the opposite director because that is where it was visible in 2018 when Yuri and Attu were on the right hand side which is why the illumination is coming from the left. The picture on the right is from 2019 2020 when Attu and Yuri were visibly overhead and in front of us. And this is when you could see in between them. And of course you've got dozens and dozens of more captures of them. This one is just so good. That is scary. And this is kind of how I saw it creep out of the light the first time I saw it by eye in 2015. And it came out. You got teeth. Right. And the wispy clouds literally make those teeth. I mean it just. He looks happy. In the NASA release is probably doctored to less scary. They probably doctored it down. Wow. Look at that. I haven't seen that yet. Is it carved or is it not carved? Is it natural? Right. And did somebody actually carve that asteroid to look like that to scare the crap out of the earth for a thousand years or whatever. Right. What's the story behind that? I'd love to know. The story of the asteroid because it's really hot. We talked about it for four years before NASA announced it. Wow. And then I chuckled God that day. They said, yeah, there is an asteroid. And then they gave the wrong orbit placement and the wrong frequency of return orbit. And I just laughed. Caught them in another lie. And, you know, they said it comes by every three and a half years in earth's orbit natural going around, you know, dinner plate scenario. When we knew better because we knew that it was not in a earth orbit pattern like earth and our normal planets because we knew it was hiding between Yuri and Atu in the other solar system that they can't even mention. But, you know, the funny thing is this is the only object that they have mentioned out of the Niver system. Yeah, that's weird. It's the only one. And, you know, I just thought of that for the first time right now. Yeah, there you go. And there's a whole shitload of stuff in behind it. Wow. And if you notice, I just kind of drew a tiny little cube in there as well. Yeah. For the right of it. The skull is a tiny little cube. It should be bigger, but I drew it in as a hint rather than if you look. Wow. There's a tiny little cube to the right of the skull. Yeah, look at that. Drawing matches. Of course it matches. Yeah, and I drew it. I draw what my brain tells me to draw. I don't, I often, I don't really think about it. I just draw. And it is... Yeah, let's see. She's asking, and the mini moon, is that something that was named already by you, Sam? No, no, we, um, is way too small. That's micro stuff compared to what we've been watching. If we tried to, if we tried to catalog everything up there, we would be, we'd be insane and then we'd be confusing everybody. Now the picture on the right here is literally one of the oldest sightings of the skull asteroid. And this was when it was horizontal, just off the horizon. Oh God, I'm just gonna say 2016-ish, 17-ish. I do not remember the year, I think the year on the left hand picture because of the light angle would have to be 2017-2018. But the oldest one is the one on the right. And that was when we knew, we had a bunch that week, that first week that we saw. We started seeing this, this came from Europe, I believe. And we were seeing it and seeing it and seeing it, and I went, no way. It's gotta be, it's gotta be three asteroids. Nah, it can't be, it can't be a skull. And then we started getting close-ups of it for a couple of months. And then we didn't even dare talk about it. And then it just became so prominent. And that we, and then I saw it by eye, about 2015. And after that being that I knew that I saw it creep around the backside of Attu in between Yuri. And I knew where the placement was in my own mind. And I went, okay, it's real. Wow. For the longest time, you know, this is back, you know, when you were first starting out, Rebecca. And we had a lot of religious folks in some of the early Montana Sky Watcher 1, 2, etc. And over the years, we still have them, but they've grown their religion and grown some science too. So, yeah. So it's just, it's been a long process to get here. But love every second of it. Has. Yeah, that one is particularly gruesome. And I believe it is back in the, and I'll notice where the light's coming from, from the left again. So this has got to be literally 2017, 2018, when Yuri was on the right-hand side of the sun. Just as Sarah was backing away, and Nibiru was backing away, and then we got to deal with Yuri. Yeah, it almost looks like a big gray alien. Yeah, that's. That is so weird. And the funny thing is, gray aliens do have eyes about that big. Most everybody improperly draws them. They make their eyes too big or too small. And I have seen my share of them. And they've got hauntingly scary big black eyes. And you don't know if they're directly looking at you or not, because there's no real pupil. They're kind of creepy. They can be nice if they want to be. And that's why I always say we know about the grays. They need to be super-bites. They look at us like animals, but I would think I'm not the nervous looking at them like they're an animal. They're jealous and they're mad at us that we're destroying our world and how we could dare to be our penance way we do when they lost their. They're right. They're recovering, recovering lost race. And they work for the higher races to do because they can atmospherically handle different atmospheres. So they are the workers. When somebody comes from another planet, they can't function well in our atmosphere. But these guys can. I don't think you... Yeah, that's completely weird. I think that's an overdramatization of reality. Okay. I don't know. I think it's like wrapping in a bind. Somebody went nuts on. Well, yeah. When it comes to grays, I don't think anybody gives that information out about grays and they have smart ones and dumb ones and they, you know, like I talk about the great big traveling facts just like velociraptors or cats or wolves. They travel in groups. And the old saying is if you see a gray or two in the woods in front of you, do not shoot at them because there's seven behind you just like velociraptors or wolves. Yeah, you got a lot in there. This shot alone is insane. The amount of objects I'm seeing here. There's a bunch of little squares there. Right here. Maybe there's some new ships we haven't seen before. I was going to ask that. It's entirely possible. They're long, they're square, they're smaller. They're different than anything we've seen. It's entirely possible another faction got here. Because those are irregular. They are, you know, absolutely irregular and they look like crap to me. I've been staring at pictures for 14 years. So if not me qualified to call it then who? Yeah, right behind the palm tree on the left is where the skull asteroid is. Okay, that's what that. Right behind it is the skull. And the spiral asteroid is over to the left above the two palm trees on the left. Do you see the spiral? Yeah, I see that. Or it's or it's pappy. I have to take it back. It's not spiral. It's pappy. The spiral should be lower off to the right and closer. And the lead object also stands out now that dark spot to the upper right. Yeah, dark spot. Yeah, darker than the ground in the size is right. And also there should be the long box cube should be on the right in that blue as well and darker. And maybe that's about the palm tree in the right. Yeah. The smaller one. He's going to go to bed. Sorry, Sam. David. I just saw David good night. It's 4 a.m. for him. So he's David. Thank you for the last show long. My God. I know. Happy Halloween in case you don't see you ahead of time. I'm glad that you're going our show and it's all David's been around forever. Thank you for your excellent membership. And we love you dearly. You can't say you next week too. I know that me too. I joined the club. You don't want to hear me sing. Oh man, it's rough. I lost my space. It's uncomfortable. It actually hurts to try to sing now since I've had the surgery. And I worry about it. I worry about it because I'm supposed to go in for more and I don't want more because I need my voice. And I don't need any more cutting on me. I don't like surgeries at all. Nope. I feel a little twinge from time to time and I'm not uncomfortable and I'm not in pain and I am swallowing okay. For the last time that lump got so big so fast it was spooky. Like I had a walnut underneath my larynx and I couldn't swallow anything anymore so I finally went in. Oh my God. No. They went, well when were you exposed to great deals of radiation? Not if, but when. And you know, I believe it was spookishima. I know I remember the day that I got rained on. Were you exposed to that much radiation? Well I remember the day that I was out in that rainstorm. It was a freak rainstorm. I went out chasing my lawn furniture. I was out in the rain for probably three, maybe four minutes. Chasing down the table in the chairs and bringing them back to the yard and stacking them so they wouldn't blow away again in an eddy wind free area. And then I came back in the house and I was on, within about two and a half to five minutes I was on fire. Everywhere that the rain was on my face, the top of my head, my shoulders, my elbows, my knees, my back. Everywhere I was bending over that the rain was on me. Especially my cheeks where the glasses, where my glasses dropped the water under my facial cheek areas. And then I was burning and I thought okay acid rain. So it was notably burning. And so I went and immediately took a shower and scrubbed that area and it was painful just to even touch those areas. And literally for about five years I had really trouble even washing my hair. Because the top of my head hurt so bad and my top of my shoulders. And then I got really sick for a very long time. I could barely do anything. I had no energy. I felt horrible. I'm trying to raise the kids at the same time and that was 2011. And then like five years later I had that surgery. And it was of course exterior cancer. It wasn't interior thyroid cancer which is natural cancer. Mine was exterior. I got exposed to radiation. And they told me that directly. So you know what blows me and I asked the doctor I said what did you report that to the CDC and she said no we don't report that. It's like well shouldn't you? And this is going on in Canada and Oregon Coast or Washington State or California right now if you go to the beach and you're listening and you go swimming at the beach stay the hell away from Black Sand. You know the areas if you're a beach goer you know what Black Sand is. Stay away from it. It's toxic. It's radioactive. You know the NOAA National Oceanic Aeronautical Administration. NOAA. Years ago and they only did it once they warned everybody absolutely to not eat any fish out of the entire Pacific Ocean. Because it's radioactive with bucushima waste which is cesium 214. And by now in some cases it might be cesium 212 or 213 or whatever because it degrades over time and then it changes into other things. Right. But you know or somebody stuck radioactive material in my house and in an effort to kill me. I don't know and you know the Russians do that to spies all the time. They bring isotopes into people's proximity where they get sick and you know could die. And I mean I got really really ill for a very long time and I didn't tell anybody. I just tried to struggle through it until I had the surgery and then when I was told what I was told then I wanted to share that information with you guys. I think it's still a crime that they're still dumping that radioactive degraded water. Now it's not as toxic as it used to be but it's still toxic and they're dumping it in the ocean every day. And they will be for years to come. Every day one. The day that happened every damn major country on this planet should have been flying bombers airplane bomber drops of cement on top of it from every country on this planet. Day one. That's what I don't get. You should build a cement mountain out of that. Yep. And then underneath it and then cemented underneath it. And they're not and it's still I mean it went China syndrome. They do the reactors. Actually. They tried building this ice so they bury these pipes around the reactor vessels into the ground. I don't know how far deep but it's the water the groundwater is coming off the mountain. To the ocean and it goes it's going right through the reactors right. And so they put these pipes in. They ran water through the pipes and they tried to freeze the ground in an effort to stop the groundwater. And it didn't work. Oh they have to build a sarcophagus over the top of it and underneath of it. And they haven't done it yet. What are they what are they doing. Why aren't other countries saying this is. Why aren't we doing something about it. We're doing something about it. I think every country on the planet. I don't know why. I mean day one they should have been dropping bomber loads repetitive bomber loads of cement over the top of that within within 10 hours. It should have been nonstop until that thing was buried in 80 feet of cement. And then when that dries you dig underneath it and then you do a third here a third here a fifth or a sixth of it in this edge and you you bury that and then you add. And yeah great people or machines going down there would be exposed. And that's the thing. There's you know we don't even know how many people are going to die from from Fukushima including their residents. But if you look at Chernobyl and stuff like that there's some weird shit going on with Chernobyl where the wolves are doing fine. As a matter of fact they're getting quite big. There are there are some noticeable genetic alterations going in some of the animals in that area. It's also not nearly as radioactive as it used to be which is odd. Of course you know who science do you trust. All right. And the same thing with Fukushima already there's people already wandering back into the Fukushima prefecture. And you know they're not getting you know 250 rads they're getting you know 100 rads or 75 and leaf was like 125 depending on which you know series of science you study. But if you go to the beaches on California or in Oregon and you walk up with to the Black Sands with a Geiger counter you'll read 128 140 which is lethal dose. If you were to let your kid play in that for an hour your kid would die within a couple of years. So if you go to the beach stay the hell away from the Black Sands because that's metal those Black Sands are metal and they have picked up the radioactive toxic waste as well as the animals and the sea lions and you know the whales and everything that's swimming in all of that water. I mean our sea our ocean life was poor poor animals that are eating all our plastic bags thinking they're squid whales etc. I just feel horrible. You know what we're doing you know when we when we when we developed plastic in 1973 and started going in the and we started inserting petroleum into ammonia and petroleum into bleach and put petroleum into these other chemicals we're making synthetic chemicals and synthetics are not natural. And when they decay they put off a toxic radioactive decay and those toxins that radioactive degradation of a synthetic it's inside of us or anything else it's not healthy. Now if it was a natural decay then it would be naturally absorbed by the human body. This is not this is a synthetic and it has it has consequences and we should never have gone as crazy as we did with plastic. It's in everything and now we're making all these kind of crazy plastics and you know if you have a bottle or a piece of plastic that breaks in your hand after about six months. You know radioactive that is or how alteringly toxic the degradation of that plastic is for it to break down that. It's pretty and don't I mean God do not keep bottled water in your car. If you do and you're adding instant toxic PCBs to your water and you're drinking it. It's like you know almost gun to your head I mean stupid do not keep I don't even buy that shit. All water comes in plastic though. I mean I know not keeping it in your car where it's hot and for a long time. We don't know where it was stored before we bought it in store. There's an average of time I think it's like it's some water can take up to like six months to get from the where they package it to the store. Right. Right. And then how long have you done that. Yeah. And then read the label like where was it stored. How hot was it. You know what they say. They say this is recycled water which means it's full of antibiotics and antidepressants and hormones and God only knows because they don't filter that shit out at the at the at the sanitation company. They don't microscopically filter that. No they sell water that came out of a came out of a water treatment plant in Houston Texas and then they added fresh water. And then while my phone was doing. Yeah. Right. Right. And that all goes into groundwater. Yeah. I think there is a glass right. You know. Yeah. I'm a gallon jug as far as safer than those plastic bottles. Now the big five gallon the blue plastic they don't break down. So if you got a plastic milk jug for about for milk will last about two to two and a half years. Those those bottle water bottles they'll last a year. And then they break and you squeeze them and then they shatter. So that shows you the breakdown of how fast there is decay and PCBs going into that water. Anyway. Yeah. Enough about that. Borax to Tara. I do that too. I have borax. Just put a little sprinkle in your water. It has some. Yeah. Borax is a quality. Borax was removed from laundry so far. Because that used back in the 70s. That's what used to cause all the bubbly foam on our our ponds and streams because the water would go into the end and would bubble and and and then you'd see all of this buzz. But if you actually have borax and you throw it into your laundry soap your laundry soap is going to clean away way better. But I don't recommend using great deals amount of use like a couple tablespoons. Don't throw a whole cup in there. Just a couple of tablespoons of borax. That way you're sort of kind of being environmentally friendly. Borax can do. I mean you Borax is used in the separation of gold. As a matter of fact. Anybody who wants to look out of process and make and learn about gold look up one of my favorite YouTubers. Mount Baker mining and metal. I watched most Mount Baker. Which is Mount Baker in Washington state. Mount Baker mining and metal. And I watch a lot of his videos. Nice guy. I watched him from a younger guy and he's actually getting gray on his chin now. That's how long I've been watching him. I hope you listen to our show. I doubt it. But you know. Mbm. Mbm. Mbm. Mbm. Mbm. Mbm. Mbm. Mbm. Mbm. Mbm. Mount Baker mining and metal. And he has his own gold mines. Lock mines and then he also breaks it down how he processes it. Now he separates the copper and there's a whole bunch of cool chemistry and alchemy going on there. He teaches all kinds of stuff. So if you want to learn how to make gold out of the side of a mountain into a little bar. He'll show you all of that. And there's a whole bunch of people that do that like Dan Hurd prospecting. It's another one that I like to watch. Dan Hurd. H-U-R-D. And he does real good. I like watching him. He's hilarious. He's from Canada. He's a sketch one guy or maybe anyway. He could be elsewhere but I think he's up there. I know he's up in Western Canada. And then there's all kinds of other ones. I still like watching the Coast Town Living. That's another good one. That's a guy who runs a body silver mine in Southern California outside of Los Angeles. Sarah Gordo mine. In case you want to watch those. And those three guys have all gotten together. I think all three of them have. I know that Mount Baker Mining and Metal has gone through Sarah Gordo and I know that he's also gone over with Dan Hurd. So they all know each other. It's kind of a cool little YouTube environment and how to process and learn about gold. Which is also part of what we're talking about here. And the fact that we earthlings are on this soft metals planet mining commodities for the higher races that own us that nobody wants to hear. That are here now parked over our heads and going okay you puny little humans give us our stuff. You know tribute of the gods whether you like it or not. No wonder the queen died. She didn't want to give up all her treasure. You imagine the mountain of gold that those people have. That Spain and France and Holland and Germany and you know the big ocean going guys from the you know British East Indies clubs and all of this shit from you know the 1500s and the robbing of the Incans and the Mayans by the Spanish and can you imagine the amount of gold that those people have amassed. Spooky, spooky. Now I bet they have to part with some of it. I bet. Where do they keep it all? In big ass bunkers underground. You don't think bucking in my palace is all ballrooms and bathrooms is it. You know those cities have been there for 700 to 800 a year you know. I mean shit. Rome for instance you know 300 to 200 AD and then prior to that was even other kink ships and all. I can't even imagine amassing that amount of gold. Anyway it would turn you crazy to try and protect all of that shit. I'd rather be poor. More money, more problems. Yeah. Yeah. Doesn't it get to like you know a certain point where you don't need anymore you know. Yeah but you don't dare leave home because somebody might sneak in and steal it while you're away. Yeah. I mean the crown jewels for God's sake. Excuse me. Can you imagine even owning the crown jewels that you couldn't wear them often enough to make it worthwhile. The star of Rhodesia or the you know the great pearl of death and all these other things that are embedded in crowns and all this crap that people died over diamonds you know the size of a golf ball. Jesus. And all of that has been sequestered by kings and we the peasants who have been you served into servitude through comfort like we are I mean right now we're a bunch of sissies. I you know could you imagine your average Joe Facebook trying to survive in Montana in a snowstorm. Hell no. No. I can't imagine trying to survive in a snowstorm. I get I've slept in snow caves before you know with a teabag and the raw rabbit sandwich. I actually did one time eat raw rabbit. It's not fun. I was in raw raw. It was partially cooked but I mean yeah it's like chewing rubber. No. Yeah. If you're if you're cold enough and you are hungry and you're like okay. No. I mean squirrels for God's sake. Why. Yeah because you're hungry and you got nothing else. That's what you eat. Well I don't know. Man. You know my like I guess squirrel and all the gamey or maids have like lower phosphorus in it and when you know my wife had my wife has a kidney transplant right so when you go into kidney failure you cannot eat you can't have any food with phosphorus in it. It does. It causes a problem with your thyroid and then it's a whole cascade of problems so they literally put in the hospital menu for her. It said squirrel. Yeah. I'm like are they making this in the hospital cafeteria. Why would that be on the hospital menu so that's always been pretty funny actually. Hey now what's wrong with a little hausen pepper. That's German for rabbit by the way. Even having that on their menu. Yeah. Hausen pepper you know. Where's my hausen pepper. Yeah. I'm an old Bugs Bunny cartoon. You know you can learn these things back when cartoons you actually teach you things. Right. Did you did you watch those Beekman's World videos that I posted. Did you enjoy them. Yeah they're good. I like the penguins. Yeah yeah. They're funny. Yeah I told you we should have listened to Montana Skywatchers. Yeah yeah. Right. Yeah I like the penguins. I forgot their names but they're pretty funny. Yeah they are. The TV catches on fire and they're funny. Yeah why don't we see the reruns of that. Come on man I'll watch the Beekman's World reruns and enjoy every second of it. Way better than Bill Nye the science guy. Yeah. Don't tell him that. Bill will probably get mad at me if he heard me. I definitely did enjoy Beekman's World very much. And they teach you science. Right. He really does teach some very good. I like the jacket. Although you know he's talking about rabbit parts and God only knows what or rat parts or you know. Oh by the way I've often thought you know one of the top if we really wanted to run a YouTube program where we could get a lot of views. We should run one called fun with farts. Yeah. And then everybody submit their daily fart photos from around members around the world. Oh man yeah. Yeah. You know that's like you gotta do weird radical stuff to get views. It's really sad. Yeah. You know we could have a generation of people tick talking pictures of the back sides as they let out the ripper of the day. Okay. Yeah. I don't. I see your point though. I mean that's where we're at. That would probably be a hit. Probably. You know. And to this day my favorite Bud Light commercial. Oh every time I think it's about that time we're going to have it out again this season. It is the Bud Light commercial with the Slay Ride. Okay. And the guy takes this girl out on a Slay Ride you know and she's sitting there and they're in a nice winter land after dark moon shining stars are out. She's holding this candle in front of her. They're dressed in all these nice beautiful wintery clothes and he goes ah now for the real surprise. So he bends over to grab out these two Bud Lights. Meanwhile she's holding this candle. Light lanes it. The horse lifts up his tail and rips off a fart and literally ignites this woman on fire and her hair is standing up and all singed in pride. He comes up ah the Bud Light and he goes whoa. Then it's still to this day my favorite Bud Light commercial is the Slay Ride and it's no matter how many times I watch it I still have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a hoot. I still break up and complete laughter. I've watched it a hundred times and Bud Light at Slay Ride it's a commercial you can look it up. And my other favorite is Rocketman, the farts scenes out of the movie Rocketman and Commander I don't feel so good and they're joined their spacesuits because they have a malfunction. So they're joined their spacesuits are joined and they're running off a One Air supply and course the dweebie guy uh he has internal gas and it's hilarious and every time i watch that for this day i still just roll on the floor lapping my butt off so that you know there's my favorite thing i have i okay i mean i've i've been married a couple times i've had three boys i've raised you know they're men now but they have a sense of humor on stuff like that that i'm just sitting there i i can't find the humor in there i'm just sitting there like what is so funny and they're rolling so i do think it's a guy tendency to think it's funny yeah you know at his own angle and um do you laugh at parts at his own angle and and and duration you know and whether or not you can make it sing and i think you know presentation is is a good portion but don't forget smell you've got to have a really gotta be ghastly you got to clear the room um and all you have to ever do is go back to the one of those old bars we're back in the when you used to have neighborhood bars and these old guys that sit there all day and they'd be eating pig snuckles out of a jar or especially pickled egg oh oh man the old days back when we you know back when they used to have neighborhood bars and oh god you'd go in there and and you know some old guy in a cowboy hat he'd be sitting there and he'd lift up you know proud as all hell by the way ben frankly one of his mottos was part proudly um okay and so the back in the old days these these good old cowboys they just intentionally let everybody see they'd lift up one leg and just rip her right there on that vinyl bar seat and would you know you'd see the the crowd actually clear people would actually get out of the way because they had no choice right oh bad you had you couldn't breathe it you you gagged i mean you immediately enveloped an automatic gag response they were so bad but that's the old-fashioned neighborhood bars pickled pig feet and pickled eggs whoo oh yeah i'm sorry i completely digressed into insanity that's fine it's funny yeah you know i i still think that if you really want to have a top website you know fun with parts wow what do you say i don't know what to say you'll get subscriptions and views from around the world right i know we're speechless sam we're speechless okay i mean i think maybe that was the premise behind all of that was you know to be silly and and uh i know i know right but i well i do what i do see though is you know i'm tick tock there be somebody that's literally doing like nothing like they're just standing there like they'll dance a little bit and they'll have hundreds of thousands of views like they're not doing anything i don't understand you know now we have to work for 500 it's so weird oh gosh we yeah we're showing real incredible images real life images and some stuff is just like what how did these we have we have to find we have to find a 23 year old latina that lives in florida there were some really skimpy tops uh with no bra and we will will be just so busy you wouldn't know what to do with it and unfortunately if you if you look at youtube right now there there's a lot of asians and i'm not saying directly just asians there's a lot of people but most of what i have seen is coming from asian asian companies or asian posters where they're they're taking thumbnails and they're doing cutoff and they're adding all of these barely dressed women it's quick take and you know they're they're adding that and that's where of course we're getting views with the you know you the initial uh animalistic tendencies of most viewers possible and you know i'm seeing a lot more of that god do you remember even like a even a year ago they started adding all of these conglomerate thumbnail pictures where they would put a disaster and a bunch of people walking through the middle of the water and a car floating away and this house coming down and they weren't even from the original picture and they were all deco posh or or combined into one clickbait photograph and there's a lot more of that and it's been going on for about a year or two years now we're all of a sudden that started and then now everybody's doing it it's kind of sad if you can't shoot your own thumbnail then there's something wrong you shouldn't create wanting to get people in because i i'll watch stuff that i want to see in the video that's on the thumbnail and it's not till the last five seconds of a 15 minute video right that's it you're saying and it's just like and it irritates the hell out of me and i'm watching i'm watching i'm watching well where's the story on what i clicked on it for this you know at the end of something i get 15 seconds at the end of a history show that's two hours long it's like or the video is like it's fine part like it it'll get all the halfway through the video and then it's like end part fine part two you know it's like and then you can never find part two so right that too i just wasted a lot of clickbait a lot well the industry's gone we've gone into a weird world where you know everybody's got a camera everybody's got a youtube channel everybody's got an idea and everybody wants to show you you taught them talking from their car seat and you know we were just talking about that the other day why are they all talking from their car seats i i mean i get it it's kind of private because their family won't let them do that in the living yeah it's a quiet spot yeah definitely uh you want a big youtube channel do it from your car driver seat that's i uh i i want a lot of uh now remember that the fake part spray those those videos those videos have thousands of views thousands of millions of views it's called the part spray spray prank you can type in that to you too you'll see you'll see 10 000 of those and they get views and now great they are hilarious i like watching them i like laughing that everybody else is freaking out because they're blaming the person for creating a smell that they couldn't humanly create if they tried and there are a lot of people that don't believe that that's real how could you buy something died inside you all of that but i mean it just blows me away here we are trying to do in a you know an authentic science citizen report from around the world all these people are seriously working together to do this and and it's like halloween costume contest if you put in a serious costume when the eight guys that walk in dressed up as crayons come in they win you know here you spent six months working on your outfit and they went and rented their costume and they went because they're cute and they're crayons you know not the barbarian with a really cool sword you know no so it's it's it's a strange world that we live in where the crazy shit or you know here let me show you how to open a can of soup or here why don't you if you're gonna cut this up here why don't you remove the the night sheath off it and actually use the real blade i mean all those crazy things or the fails or the or like a boss videos and all of that is spooky yeah now i like i like parkour videos and i like people that do unbelievable stunts and all of that i watch some of them and you know like i said i watched slap ham or or uh what's that guy's name uh can't can't think of his name but i watch a few the paranormal videos i watch a few of the ufo people i watched uh i somebody that we were talking about earlier asked me if i watched joe rogan i go no um oh yeah everybody watches in my god excuse me i don't want to scrape off any iq points i don't need to do that thank you and you know there's a lot of people that believe in this man but uh he's doing he's doing tabloid journalism not doing journalism yeah and i i want to show though that's another story well there you know i i think a lot of these shows out there that are talking about et's and all of this they don't have any opera rolled information they have supposition their idiots that are watched youtube and they didn't even research they went and watched two videos or five and not that you know not the 10 15 years mainstream or mainstream they're gonna follow whatever the narrative is right seriously and then they're all you know i have the three or four guys that are all sitting there you know from from their group in their early 30s or whatever and they're all just gossiping and they're you know being suppositional but they're not ever coming to any real science they're just talking and yet you know they've got the the big studios and the big equipment and the microphones and the headphones and the gear and all the money and oh man yeah joe rogan joe joe used to be joe really good he was a little conspiracy theorist extremist but now he's really gone because he knows where the money is well if he's under a contract you got to say whatever they want you to say you know you don't have much freedom right why don't you have you have you know directors and you have other people come in and you know and they say well this is how we're going to run the show and this is what we want you to say and here's your topic and then he comes in does a couple hours behind the microphone does this thing that he got used to doing over the years and is handed an agenda and yeah i can see it um although it's it's too easy unfortunately for a lot of these people to become too famous and then those that are really not working at being famous but want to be popular enough to get out the truth that's a different story and i think about that all the time like why have we not taken off why haven't we gone viral maybe it won't happen till show 96 or 115 or 257 you know i mean i i i don't know oh boy yeah hi and welcome to show 1586 near bruce left three years ago they was there i swear it was you youngins are lifting i don't think that's gonna happen i hope not i hope i don't i i i what we're seeing has just been so incredible i people are gonna have to start waking up to this there's just no way this is gonna pass pass this by nobody can our people just continue to not see this it's crazy yeah you know we only had purple skies for the last decade there never used to be it i mean all you have to do is go back and watch a 1970s western go back and watch dirty harry uh in the 70s in la and look at the skies go back and watch a movie from the 80s goonies look at the sky these are not the same skies by any measure of what we have today not even close and you know to my kids those are ancient movies like way back in the 40s dad and they're talking about the 90s you know and i i constantly i'm watching you know surlock homes that was made in 1937 god dad that's really old you know yeah yeah and these are the you know black and whites and stuff why why are they black and white dad well they didn't have colored film back then you know really why you know and then you try to could you imagine trying to explain you know the rotary dial phone to anyone these days it's and that the poem used to actually be on the wall and you or even how about uh what did they used to call those shared lines um what was it party lines party lines yeah when i was living in minnesota on route two on our chicken farm uh you picked up the phone you didn't necessarily get to talk you usually had to wait for the other three grandmas they were all talking non-stop to each other and you'd have to actually fight to get on the phone yeah and pretty vicious arguments happened over why you kept it last week and i'm taking my turn i'm not even you that bread i talked about this week you know and i mean they people got mad at each other over the stupid party lines and i don't know how many times we screamed at some of these old women get off the phone yeah we need the phone you know right and you can't even explain that those are the days and you take your phone away from somebody and oh my god they have a fit if you grab somebody else's phone watch what happens to them it's like they can't breathe without it and i i don't have one so i don't have that issue but what's scary is the kids that have these phones that are you know they show this one child this one younger kid maybe i don't know what grade he's in at elementary school and the teacher takes his phone away and he freaks out and he's like grabbing her hair and pulling her hair out and this is in the classroom they're just going nuts it's really sad it's become it's become more than it should be yeah and not only well you know nobody puts a phone up next to the side of their head anymore fortunately there are a few people and then that's it they've finally learned those things do put off radioactive electrical discharging which is not and if you carry your phone in your pocket you're silly because those batteries can light on fire um spooky no that you're getting the radiation in your leg and you can end up with a tumor in your leg um i would frankly i'd keep one of the i i don't even use them because they're not safe they really aren't but then if you boil it back down and even Tesla knew this if you live in a house with electricity and those little plug-in boxes all around you you're also in a cancer causing carcinogenic uh electrical field and we need to rethink how we're living and i think a lot of people will be a lot healthier if they didn't live in these electric boxes tesla knew this they warned he warned Edison about it Edison went around it to the you know cheapest possible ac dc because he wanted direct current and and Edison wanted you know alternate direct current and the one was safe and the other one's not and we're living in a society ever since 1898 with these electrical fields that we should not be living in and i think overall a lot of people would be healthier if they didn't live if you lived off grid and you had one wire coming in from your cell collection to your battery and then instead of having that big circle of plug-ins around you everywhere that you're living in an electrified box you'd be better off with less and i i eventually hope that would you learn that i hope man smartens up before it's too late oh boy da da da da da da da you know vinyl countdown and all of that my kids are even singing that song regularly it's hilarious i played it so many times they've actually become to the like that you know this final countdown song but i can't remember who made that or one of the hair bands anyway wasn't foreigner not what foreigner it was uh wasn't well i can find that out really fast but find it out i'm just final countdown i read my facebook page go okay final uh it's on the it's on the i can see it in my brain europe europe europe that's who's saying it and there was a while there was a really cool nibburu version uh and maybe you can people in europe can get it if you type in final countdown nibburu version and there was a copy out there and somebody did a really good good thing of that and they were actually showing the planets which was great yeah michelle knows there are a bunch of people out there that are doing side videos from our work even though we don't see it and thank you as long as you get the details right and that's what counts you know what i did find people have shared different things videos or posts i find things on pinterest i find things just uh huh if you google or being whatever nibburu followers anonymous or sam hoffman you'll find just i don't know who they are but they have you know built like free websites basically you know i assume they're free but anyway yeah with pictures and videos in it people are sharing yeah and you don't see um some of my videos in my earlier understanding the sky series were translated and i think about five different languages wow and we don't see copies of those but i had a lot of people i had one guy from south america one guy from sweden uh one guy from france a couple other people from around the world asked me if they could translate them into their language and i said absolutely you have my permission go ahead and we've never seen those copies but they're out there i wish we had them maybe you know well they'd be speaking oh with my house yeah we have people that have asked for videos translated yeah yeah so yeah and if you're out there and you are from another country and you are bilingual and you would like to take some of our videos and even take excerpts and translate them contact us and most likely we will let you do that all right it'd be good and help you know well it's like that um do you have a copy of that et one that that was posted on nibburu followers this week where it's me talking like yeah i yes play that let's get it okay let's put it et is here yeah i saw that i watched it a couple of times oh by the way there's these cube ships that are here with fleets of star destroyers and smaller support craft and a space tube and an empire orb and everything else and they're freaking here and they're real et is here boys and girls by the thousands there's thousands and thousands and thousands of them up there i mean people wiser beings on them these hundreds and hundreds of ships they're real they're here what more do you want to know but find out just look up you know i'm oh my god i sound like a nut job coming up here i know but oh we've been talking about it for years come on oh my god i don't know sorry it is it's that crazy to me because we have been talking about them for years with absolute proof that they're here i mean from around the world you know we get you know 10 20 captures a day for i don't know how long that we you know every day somebody sends me either the long box cube the texas cube the the the star destroyers the the support craft or the tube or or the empire orb every day i get every day i get somebody around the world's capture and we have not been able to not say that that hasn't happened for many years now and this is happening every day and they're there they're real this is an old one sporadic sighting here and no no every day from around the world people send me absolutely identifiable the empire orb has not been lately cited not lately i think now we've been talking about that orb the big orb behind the moon now is that where they've been parking it to hide it or are they back in front of the sun because we haven't seen the black dot in quite a while i remember the black spot with the empire orb parking in front of the sun right it was intermittent it wasn't a camera fail like everybody debated because otherwise we would always see it right it was intermittent meaning that's when they were there that we could see the black dot in front of the sun and uh and then when they moved and we had evidence of that we went hey the black dot is not in front of the sun it's over here and we did see some evidence one of my drawings there was evidence one time of the empire orb being parked next to the longbox cube and the side orb but i forgot to draw in the side orb in that one drawing where i have it tagged as long or as empire orb but um when i drew that drawing it was because we had reports for credible about 15 of them um where everybody saw the actual empire orb with the eye and the light array which is different than the side orbs the empire orb is bigger and it has this oculus with a center thing with the blue light which is also on the start up of our show but you don't get to see it well enough um the empire orb or the uh norway spiral orb or if you wanted to really go crazy the death star um uh it has a different noticeable absolute array and we have we've had for so many years we've had sightings but not recently we have not seen the empire orb in anything play that video oh is it that writing one yeah that one i mean look at that you know that i turned on and i saw that by i myself so i immediately knew that this this video was legitimate because it did exactly what i saw it do that light emits out of the central oculus array and there's four other lights around it two above two below that also can turn on we've got close-ups of that and we don't share those pictures very often don't want to get in trouble and the smaller craft these are these are orbs or or star destroyers or star ships but you can see that definite facial marking is different with an oculus see that eye it looks like an eye it's the eye of raw all of that all yeah i didn't think about that huh okay that was it so yeah we haven't seen the empire orb in a few months it's been a couple of months since we've actually seen it but the long box cube and the texas cube every day and of course star destroyers and the landing craft and all of that and i i most for the most part send me small stuff that we can't identify i tell them excuse me that's small stuff we don't pay attention to that and if i can't identify it i'll tell you if i can i'll tell you that but uh we generically don't deal with the small stuff could this be the same thing here that tarot caught that was going left remember the well it does have the facial markings of the of the eye uh huh let's go back it's just an array of lights around it then it would be but there are there is an asteroid out there with a big hole in it as well and then people confuse that for the longest time being the empire urban it wasn't just an asteroid with a hole and i think that was something that somebody snagged off of somewhere off the internet off of jupiter god only knows where it originally came from and i do worry sometimes people are taking pictures and intermixing them and telling us well this is something i saw when it could actually be a natural normal part of our normal solar system yeah it's a hard call but it fits the criteria for the oculus eye of the empire or it does have facial markings that do you know it's looking up instead of at us but i i saw it where it actually stopped dropped out of the clouds changed directions and turned around and then then turned that blue light on and i saw it and it saw me and it was like you know freaky wow so when we saw that footage that rebecca showed previous to this uh where the light turns on i mean i knew immediately that it was real wow i'm not uh not photoshop i will be right back i'm gonna run across the house real quick okay okay i'm trying to get your videos here and i don't know what i did it's like like showing all my videos out of order i don't know i'm like maybe i you know like what did i do it's it's yeah i don't know it's not where it should be i know i'm not a computer expert just everybody knows that oh my gosh i had to like it had been years since i touched a laptop right i've been on my cell phone for years and years so i had to like go to the youtube school and teach myself how to operate this thing again yeah i'm the laptop's compared to computers yeah it's like oh and i hate the i hate the the finger scroll i like my mouse i like the mouse and i have oh here it is okay i think right yeah right right i mean i'm way more efficient on my cell phone yeah i wish that that that nice person that sent me the laptop would have sent me what i wanted other than what i didn't need there here we go again this is the one from tariff so it is very similar yeah yeah but i don't see that central eye i just don't okay okay and it doesn't have the blip that the blue asteroid has and it is coming from right to left so that is what makes me think that it is a a craft a actual larger um craft because it's not leaving a trail either an asteroid trails you see some sort of vaporization behind their pathway okay now i don't see any of that on here yeah this looks like it is not putting up any emissions it's not creating any eddies it's not leaving any pathways uh it is low off the deck too because we're looking at the angle and there again is the the crest of the house edge and that means it's mostly close to us therefore that makes it a smaller up small that is so close yeah so if i would say this is a a a drone or yeah again i i don't see asteroid in this at all there's no eddy material at all there's no no pathway and of course again it's okay that's such a cool capture it really is that's a good one yeah it's it's down to the small stuff where i you know i hate to even guess but you know i would say this is a technological drone right because i would never catch you think that cool i don't know you know i could be out there every night probably not see anything yeah you know you're best hiding for usually something you catch out of the corner of your eye when you weren't looking for it and then you got a rush to get your damn camera 11 p.m 11 p.m well yeah i know i said get out i got that one yeah she said she was just outside just looking up and there it was this destiny well remember she's new at this and she's far more devoted to us than us old folks who are getting so you know worn down by all of our years of doing this i'm joking of course but yeah i don't go out as often as i used to and i don't look up as often as i used to and i'm you know trying to do with other things with the kids and of course you know um now that they're higher teenagers they have other requirements that require more of my time use and dad i want to go here dad i want to do this dad i want to do that and it's like okay yeah whereas before it was a little easier when they were understandable all we had to do was go to the park back then and play on the swings but now it's different dad i want to go to the mall and i want to look for a merch like but i don't have money for merch but what dad if i don't get merch i'm just gonna die okay chik-ching chik-ching what does that mean i mean in their world what is merch merch merch well um my daughters are currently into my hero academia which is uh japanese anime okay okay yeah and there is so into it that they've got to have the little the statue of the guy and that's so and so and and this this guy he's got another name and this guy's a bad guy and he's got all of these weird attributes but we love him i was like oh okay that's why it's 44 dollars yeah uh-huh wow what's it called again oh my hero academia my my uh okay my my youngest son loves anime i have to ask um my daughter shilo has quite a few videos that she has put together and i i'm not supposed to tell you that but she has some of her drawings and she's putting out videos on her own hand drawings of her my hero characters and she's very very good at it she's better than anime in some cases i mean she's really good at i don't know how she's doing it wow she's excellent at her japanese means very anime oriented in her drawings so she's learned how to hand draw anime and she has this big fetish for for colored pens right now and and i'm buying her card stock paper for her drawing so she doesn't draw just on paper and uh we used to draw her oh shilo um she drew so much that we would go through bundles of of copy paper and she would just draw and draw and draw she's a draw a haul like she likes to draw now nova does really good computer art her graphic art is insane it's like oh my god you drew that oh yeah like how did you do that would have taken me six months on a paint program oh i just do it dad no problem and she's got a laptop she does all over draw she's a really good graphic artist i mean she has a career if she wanted one but uh and that's why i let them go on their on their computer skills because that's their error right now is computer and their handwriting is terrible they don't ever write anything uh the other day no but was writing on on one of these pages and i was looking at her handwriting going oh my god and i i'm trying to get them to work on their handwriting and they said dad nobody nobody writes anymore it's like what oh wait we we text your type like wow they don't even teach cursive in school anymore right they they cannot and i'm constantly trying to teach them how to read cursive and they go dad i can't read this isn't cursive and i went what what i taught you this oh yeah but that was a long time ago dad and it's like i taught you this oh well i don't see it very often so i don't use it it's like and they can't get the fact that all it is doing is running the one letter to the other and it just doesn't sink in it's like okay you know i took calligraphy you know i i used to do gothic calligraphy and drafting i i went you know i took drafting you know with the drafting pens in the arms and perspective and all of that i did all of that drawing and i well actually i studied i'm i'm an artist and i i studied you know two point one first one point perspective is all of that and graphic design you name it and my daughters are better artists than i am and i mean i can you know okay andrew says uh part you your parted part off etc it caught my attention i read part and instantly gathered my my attention see it works i mean see what i mean i used to do a movie uh the stability would always put part you you've parted part off or everyone in the camera was in tears laughing okay yeah what a world we live in in but hey i'm sorry parts are funny i i'm sorry parts are funny and it is maybe it's a guy you know shallow absolutely detest me every time i even bring it up you know is your dad you know i guess it is a guy thing but parts are funny especially ones that you didn't plan on right okay maybe once in a while well now years ago burger king used to make onion rings now they're different than what they make them now but oh my god if you you years ago if you ate burger king onion rings you did not dare go out to the bars no no no no no you are not allowed oh boy oh i have a story i'm not i'm not gonna share i a burger king onion rings story i'm not gonna share but it was from the band days here we go again yeah i i i'll i'll save that for my memoir so people can chuckle and roll out of the aisle because you know it's one of the best part stories of the whole world but anyway yes back back to the skies and away from parts oh man that's how do we overcome that um well we got there because we were talking about view counting and if you really wanted to have the highest you know rated youtube channel fun with parts now watch we'll find somebody will take that idea and watch we'll see what happens and uh here's another really gross one my brain went there um you know how many people take pictures of turds in toilet oh oh you know look at this monster zeppelin oh my god you know i mean horrible but uh i've never heard of that before hey look what i did today oh my god oh yeah yeah or you know some some guy left this at the restaurant at the movie theater or whatever in the bathroom oh my god look at this how did this man survive this and they take photographs up and some of it you know i don't know how many over the years in the early internet days when when some drunks would come home and they pass out into somebody else's apartment and they shit themselves and people would take photographs of that and shame them on the internet oh look at billy did ah you know and you know i remembered that from years ago in the in the 2006 and 2007 and eight early dial-up internet days that those pictures were going around awful lot you know and they're horrible and they're gross but they actually get views you you could have one oh this is my cat box look this is the cat box this week look at gems they you know i know it's horrible look what tabby left for you you know i mean i'm really i'm really digressing into insanity the years at just before eight hours and yeah i've gone insane i promise you have normal you know that could be terrible like this is not normal maybe we need to share this with somebody's yeah you know we you could call the channel cow pie you know and and look what i created and you know and like you know you're an animal right and you know you could have a whole scientific study genre you know and we might have to test this out and just make a you know stupid video and post it on tiktok and see how many new followers we get let's try it let's try hi and welcome to fun with mark this week we have a fighting coming in from uh Worcester massachusetts where bill bends over with his striping groupings and here we go and rip oh my gosh they're always coasting you got here right in time hi you put a you know a volume meter with it you know and and see if you peg out to you know classify well why that's a classified bender bill you're this week's champion yeah yeah yeah i know i i know i apologize but you know what are you on eight hours you know we're coming up on eight hours of talking of course we're gone insane you know i don't know what happens at all yeah not really no not really i mean i am i really fast i used to do you know like i'm 12 hours shifts to the hospital and they would just drag drag right i don't know if it's because i don't have a clock in front of me or maybe that's it i don't know or we're just having fun see you know time flies when you have been fun so i think that's part of it too it doesn't feel like it's been an eight hour work day right no no not at all yeah and i'm not even sore from sitting in this chair i should be you know broken from sitting in the same chair for eight hours straight yeah or my butt should be the size of texas but neither one of those are true i think we've built endurance we've built up the endurance to be able to talk for you know ever yeah yeah we have changed you know and i you know we we have grown with our with our social skills on on the computer and and if you agree with us you can agree with us if you disagree with us let us know when that one too um you know um we'd like to know as you the listener out there if we're doing a good job if we're doing a mediocre job if we're doing a terrible job tell us we we'd like to know what you want to hear what you want to see is there a genre or a topic or a discussion that you could uh want to know about you want you know do you want us to research some parts of Rome do you want us to talk about Greece what do you i mean you know what information do you want to learn because i like going in and studying things and if you have a question i'll go look it up and i if i don't know i will i will try to find the answer well and you know the sun i mean people don't even understand how the sun works if you have questions we can look that stuff up we can share more sun picks we can i mean i don't generically talk about the sun except you know when we had some major x-class flares and we did have an x2 go off and you know that's on msn information right now and uh the information's out there is just that people have to want to know or go looking for it and if you're not into it well i can understand that but if you don't understand how things work and you want to know then we can also go into that great let us know i mean we need more comments from people on the youtube videos after post-production uh that way we can you know we can because i read them every every you know like today before when i got on the computer i was out in the living room reading the only unfortunately six comments on last week's show and there should be far more people and and what's the deal we're getting 500 600 views and 50 likes so if we're only getting that many likes what are we doing wrong that didn't get us a thumbs up so be sure to subscribe hit the notification buttons and hit like in the comments because this is of course is going to you know boost the algorithm for rebecca and she needs to go viral she needs that that youtube plaque behind her the little silver one to start with and uh and then we go i learned on tiktok and i i think it's probably the same for all the platforms everybody has it any of your followers has to comment on your video they have to say more than five words on the comment and then they have to watch a certain amount of time of the video so you should watch like at least 40 seconds of the video before you make a comment and then you know do all the other things like i think you have to like is watch the end of the video as well right which would be a hamper to us because we're doing eight hour long videos right scroll that far over to the end and our view we're getting about 500 600 views right if you just scroll past the video and and don't hit the 42nd mark then it doesn't count as anything so you that's what i learned on tiktok basically i see and um you know like when i was trying to figure it all out that's when i like got a whole bunch of followers and then i stopped doing i stopped adding those kinds of videos and then the you know the followers dropped off so i guess i gotta start doing that again see what happens i very much like this week videos especially the typing i like the type set on it it gets your attention uh people want to read it right away um i still think you should do a a catchphrase with your face on it first okay and then oh hi this is christin vegas or whatever whatever your catchphrase is or or never sky watch whatever um and and then reuse your logo and then that way your thumbnail presence they'll grab hold of and you can then you can bait them with what's coming in the video right today i've got a really great capture of this why don't you take a look and then you then they'll sit down and watch it unfortunately with our shows we've got eight hour long shows and i noticed tonight today that the startup intro on rebecca's is over two minutes long it's two minutes 38 something like that and that's a long intro and you could you could use the first intro because you're adding two together you have two intros yeah i know and well you know because i fast forward past even like when i watch dan heard prospecting and i hear his music come up i've seen it so many times it's now become annoying to me so i automatically flip past his opening so you know i'll scroll past remember my smart tv and so that part of that intro uh should grab people to gather men and then you got to tease them with a today in today's episode or which we we can't quite do here but for you for your short or shorts that you're going to make you can keep that in mind just guess i'm not good but it's a suggestion yeah that i could incorporate something like that thumbnail grab hi you know welcome to the start-up hi this is rebecca today's date is you know october 26 2024 welcome to the show and then kick in the startup because then you've got partially you got your thumbnail startup to those people because you know we've seen a lot of people they say oh my god that video is three minutes long that's too long i can't watch it yeah i've had actually people tell me that and yet we're here at eight hours and four minutes you know i'll watch it like 20 times you know because i love it and that's kind of well you why would you shorten your your attention span down to below three minutes and that's always bothered me that people say that i said excuse me but i don't do science that way i don't judge a video by if it's two minutes and 15 seconds versus four minutes or four hours how could you even get the information into three minutes right right so it would be a weird why would you want to eliminate yourself by that if it's a topic on the e-jift i'll spend four hours watching it if it's interesting you know if you lose me in the first five minutes i'm clicking off right if you get boring and you start talking down to me i'm done i don't you know i'm not a fifth grader and i have a very high education so hand me the information i want and don't tease me with a bunch of junk and then there's those guys that are out there and then i've noticed a lot of this where they talk like this and they drag the end of their words down and it's like oh my god who taught you how to talk and i when i hear them talking like that they could be smart as a whip but if they're doing the inflection i can't even i can't even copy them and there's a group of people out there that talk like that anyway shocking shocking i watch a lot of youtube um i wish i could see more tiktok but i i don't have the phone so i don't see tiktok you could do tiktok on your computer i got a friend request the other day from elon musk i didn't believe the first second it was really on musk but i actually got of course not oh no well that other one that remember that that one that we thought that was a request from uh i can't remember his name now uh that i'd been trying to contact for all these years and then turned out it wasn't john more yeah this is what was john more it was not john more it was a fake john more and that was kind of sad and i was actually excited it's like hey you know i'm i tried to contact john more about eight different times and oh he's finally you know eight years later gotten hold of me um but no it wasn't the real john more i was i was partially excited and of course you know let's learn i'll never believe it i'll have to proof check until he actually talked to me on the phone you know before i ever believe it again uh you know it's like when i first started the radio wasteland series i didn't believe that john c was serious i said you really want to interview me he says oh yeah i did my homework and i went and checked out and then he said you know i went and looked around and and asked a whole bunch of people who do i now who do i talk to and of course that's in in radio wasteland show number 13 uh so you can type that in radio wasteland number 13 samuel hoffman on youtube and that's the first show i did with radio wasteland and i thought john c was an excellent excellent uh interviewer and we would pre-plan the show and then halfway through the show he would drop some bombs on me and try to really press me and and prove me wrong and but it was never it never came off like that right he would he would actually ask dramatic important questions that would get me off my center of balance and yet i i you know came out in my corner of expertise and had a tendency to go way further on the shows with him than i would have normally believed i should but he did he was a good interviewer he pulled information out of me and it was like ooh i didn't want to talk about it but i did and so and i that was last week boy i said too much last week so if you didn't see last week's show go back and watch i said way too i was talking about aliens and off-planet and god and you name it and by the way there are god there are gods up there and there's demigods below them and and gods above them and wow you wouldn't believe what's out there and you wouldn't believe what's in interspace too an interdimensional shit oh god don't even get me started about egyptian magic wow that is some spooky stuff now i i looked into egyptian magic long enough to find out it was something i wanted to play with because i saw adverse reactions from egyptian magic which is quite real and quite uncontrollable so yeah you don't play with magic you do not play with it because it will go boom in your face or you could turn one of your friends into an elemental and you'll never see them again so and that is possible as well or you can invite things in if you were playing and never oh my god never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever buy or play with a weegee board ever don't bring one in your home don't touch one don't go anywhere near that you are playing with shit you don't you're not even ready to deal with and yes i saw it i could have child virgins even like oh my god obi-ji boards yeah the real jumanji come out to play um yeah why they are they think that's a kid's toy that is the one thing that i i listened to my mother when my see my mother was very religious and she was like oh you're mortal soul and you better you know do your prayers and all of this and she was very adamant about it she was quite religious well my whole family was and uh that was the one thing that she was absolutely right about was never allowing a weegee board into the house and i i holy you don't play with those because there's more to them they're laid out and granted they're manufactured but they're laid out with uh some things you don't want to mess with but anyway we don't need to go into too much detail on that but there's a lot too spirits there's a lot too the spirit world there's a lot too interdimensional beings there's a lot too mirror magic that you don't want to screw around with there's a lot too egyptian magic you don't want to screw around with there is a lot too a lot of things that i got that you know i mean this for instance the sphinx and the pyramids if you knew the difference in age between them you wouldn't believe it uh the the sphinx is millennium multi tens of thousands of years older than the pyramids and modern science isn't giving you that that one point time the sphinx was under the underwater up to its neck for long periods of time not short periods of time not a blood but a oceanic period and so the great blood so that tells you to go back over 8,000 years whereas with the egyptian the egyptian dynasties only go roughly four or four and a half five thousand six thousand years depending on which part of egypt you're referring to which dynasty and there were 31 pharaohs people don't even know that it's like oh wow really um there's a lot too information that has been just you know okay we got pyramids and they're set up and they're like the iran but there's so much more to it and what pyramids are what they were i mean they're they're digging up technology now that they're just finally admitting to and you know then the giants and all of that and all of this you know previous suppressed western science suppression and if you if you go back to the arab's i mean the arab's were scientifically advanced beyond even what they're recognized today as and it's really kind of sad they don't get the credit they deserve of course according to white man and i'm a white man so therefore maybe i can say that uh but yeah there's there is so much more going on around us even even you know when you see something flying out of the corner your eye in your living room and you could swear that you saw something because it's real uh when you see something you see something in it and it is quite real so there's a lot your spirits there's demons there's beasts there's shit out in the forest there's cryptids there's bigfoot there's you name it there's dog people you name it i mean when all these sightings are coming in from around the world repetitively it's real you know i mean there's people that are disappearing all the time that get eaten by something and we never hear of them i saw a video the other day on slap tam again where they showed this video of these creatures that were attacking and they looked like cryptids and the story behind it was it was this off these people's camera but the people vanished but all they found was their camera in the forest now i don't know if that's the whole story but from what i watched it looked very authentic so you know and there's areas in the united states on the east coast where there's cryptids running around like crazy and people go we don't go into that forest anymore because uh you know and there's bigfoot all over the place i totally believe in bigfoot i have been in the forest before where i have come across some of the smelliest things that i ever smelled in my entire life but it wasn't anywhere on the ground it kept moving and we could smell this creature and wasn't a bear yes bears like to eat rotten nasty stuff but what we were smelling was really bad uh so you know there there's i've been in encounters i haven't personally seen one i have friends that are bigfoot hunters uh so you know there's a lot to that and all of these sightings are for a reason so you have to realize there is so much more going on them and then we'll be you're not aware of and i mean my god look at the planets and they're right there and yet 90 percent of the planet does not even know about it and the longbox cube the texas cube the star destroyers the empire orb the the long space cube they're there but most everyone does not know and only if you go look at you sorry that reminds me at this video i sent it to jillian but let me show you all don't want to get your opinion on this sam because i thought it might be real these beings oh boy i hang on i i have watched a bunch of those videos and i think i'm pretty uh huh pretty good at examining things right okay here we go more you know photo shopping and all of that yeah the refractive eye so real um um save it i don't know it's like uh several they're they're walking on off fours for one thing uh skinwalkers rakes oh no oh no okay well we'll see here in a second i'm saving it i'm gonna send it to the computer and yeah i uh i told you gonna uh the skinwalker ranch for instance i would imagine they probably have a a collective living under that ranch underground because i know that there are underground bases at the texas uh mexico border that that are not openly talked about but they're there and some are some are owned by us and some are not and there's a there's a i mean you know we saw the dark new pictures of the dark side of the moon and it wasn't dark and of course dead center in the middle of that is that big huge pile and opening of the main entryway to the dark side of the moon which is supposedly a uh a gray uh uh outpost base and on the back side of the moon and when i was uh involved in the uh farce and group that's one of the first things that we knew with there we knew that it was there and it wasn't the target but it showed up in our minds and me and a couple other people talked about it when we weren't supposed to but um yeah we noticed that there was an uh there's an alien base on the dark side of the moon and if you look at that picture and i have that photograph um if you look at the photograph you can see in dead center in the middle of the planet there's this big mound where there's a hole in it and it goes deep inside the moon so the question is what was the moon was the mood a small dyson spear that was placed there that over the millennium over the last 280 million years or whatever gathered dust on top of it and a bunch of asteroids hit it um is earth a dyson spear have you ever looked up what a dyson spear was dyson spears can come in many different sizes some can in case an entire star system as a matter of fact recently there's been rumors that the james web telescope has discovered dyson spears so guys yeah there is so much going on that we are bare surface of okay here's that video okay yandies some answers what is going on what is the what are these things these people are going crazy look at this y'all there's so much going on in this video what is this those are skin walkers why have they got four of them thoughtful does anybody know what these things are i have nothing they're dangerous as hell why do they look like they're supposed to be walking upright but they're walking on our force and they're yelling has anybody seen these type of pictures before i've never seen that many in one group it's the yelling for me it looks like this guy has come across these creatures but the guy on the tractor they are blind to the number of participants with the lights as soon as he saw them what is they're usually way faster what these are whoa that is weird we have no idea what's skin walkers are dangerous and very quick very agile these are slow i i don't get this i wouldn't let one get that close to me it's like a bad cloning experiment or something yeah right i believe i believe that they i believe that they are a race that does have what that has been living here in our force or actually has extra uh has technology to come and go i i believe that this is a creature from another race wow and there's a lot of them they eat some nasty stuff and they're violent from what i understand and from everything i've ever seen is they're way faster way more agile and these are weird there's something you know granted you could not put a human in a body suit to do that yeah these are not people dressed up because they have the hips and the legs are wrong the hips are way too big and the legs are way too long to be an actual human see weird weird yeah but usually skin walkers are very agile very quick they've got nasty claws and they're usually very violent and they hiss a lot these guys are lethargic and lost this is weird i've never seen four of them in one group i've seen two of them at a time and three of them at a time but i've never seen that many this is weird maybe they're wiped out in the desert and they're thirsty and almost suffering maybe they're sick karek terry said they're sick maybe yeah it's until well you know maybe they have covid too who knows whoops i shouldn't say that i should say the c-virus um ah yeah they're you uh they look hungry no i don't know i don't know it's like it's like they're usually faster and violent these guys are all sick they escape from a lab or something they there's some kind of like experiment gone wrong what is that we've had cryptids these are these are what are known as rakes right and they of course take different forms depending on who drew them or painted them but these are way more docile than i've ever seen them this is weird strange this is usually they're violent and they run across the the boundary and they cover you know 50 yards before you can really even see what they are through the night and like i said if you want to see a bunch of this stuff you can look up the slap ham on youtube and he does a really good job of and he puts out a lot of videos there's many years of back videos to watch yeah look at that look at the body structure i will look at it close to me they can jump 10 feet wow uh nicole says sam you say race what do you mean i'm not sure what she means well a race of aliens yeah a race of aliens uh they could have had the technology to come down land here maybe they do in small groups and they you know these are the guys that the harvest the cowlips do or whatever or or the eat people or what i don't know and i'm not trying to cause that fear factor but it is believed that these guys actually eat people okay yeah i can see that to me they look like animals no but they're they're they're they're violent but they're also intelligent because looks the size of their skull remember brain size you know t rex's were giant that they had a they had the brain the size of your fist i see you know brain size and that's why you know never discount a horse because a horse has a bigger brain than you do never discount an elephant because an elephant has a way bigger brain than you do oh they're so smart oh yeah and and it's pity they can't talk they could probably teach us a lot like how bad we're screwing things up so she's asking is it a race of cryptids yeah yeah yeah that's a cryptid and a rake a cryptid now there are there's there's wolf you know like god i'm trying to think of the term for that like anthrax you know though all of those legends have have you know a basis to it vampires you know i think a lot of that comes from vampire bats because you know there are vampire bats that will sneak up to you or a cow at night and they they're they're spit anesthetizes it so it doesn't feel the wound and they cut a hole and start drinking the blood out of cattle and they do that in africa so i perhaps that legend grew out of you know out of the book of shelly's mind you know count Dracula and of course the genre has grown from there um same thing with lord of the rings created where you know dragons and wizards and guys walking around with pointy hats so that's of course our history has been changed by by uh media and and writing skills um but you know the the rake and all of that there have been so many sightings that are exactly the same those bent over creatures that walk like they should be human walking but they don't they crawl on their hands and feet and there's been millions of sightings over the years so i i truly believe that rakes or cryptids are real and i mean what an example is uh skin watch skin walker ranch and they're making a fortune on that you know bringing people in and charging money at the gate excuse me i'm gonna real i'm gonna hit mute and i'm gonna blow my nose you have to pardon me for two seconds okay you're fine well let you pause yeah i don't want to go to skin walker ranch no i don't want to see one uh uh uh because then once you see it you can't forget it that's right no you know it real is i'm not one of those people that realization of et doesn't need a door and having you know a lizard man grow out walk out of the wall with the red eyes and all of that that's really i know um and being you know facially slapped front you know something grabs you that you can't even see even when they're grabbing you and face plants you on your keyboard and it cuts a hole in the back of your head and you bleed all over the house once you go through that yeah it's freaky and scary and shit like that but you sometimes forget and then when you remember you go oh my god i wasn't paying attention and that could be scary in itself as well um dry throat um yeah i i often sit there and remind myself that i am i am highly lucky that i haven't been face planted in three or four years and and i you know knock on wood i find myself very lucky that i haven't been abducted that i know of recently and uh consider myself very lucky i haven't been yanked out of bed by some unseen force that is a spirit you know we're in orb i mean all of that is possible so much all of that is real and there's so many sightings over the millennium you know that you can't ignore these things they're real well you mentioned red eyes like i in my 20s i saw some we had a dog we had two beagles right and we had a dog door and like a run on the side of the house and i saw something come in the dog door at like you know real early in the morning this thing had red eyes and i don't know it's scared the raccoons occasionally will have red eyes uh but even crocodiles have red eyes right i don't know i don't know what it was i don't know i know i wasn't dreaming i know it yeah an animal like cats and stuff they have the rounded back of the eye which is what you know and if you see you know if you've ever gone deer shining not that i'm recommending doing that but if you've ever gone out into the forest with a flashlight at night those animals that you they look at you and you can see their eye yeah and so every bright glowing white eyes and dracos have or lizard men have red uh just like just like alligators so uh yeah if you see in the light if you see a pair of red eyes i would be very cautious and respect we'll go to you at it right i i think most if uh if cryptids came at me in the middle of the forest i might start pulling the trigger yeah i i don't recommend it but i mean hell i'd be the hell out of there if i saw one anywhere in the forest around me because i you know i i've always believed them to be very violent and very speedy and i those those were docile i can't believe they may have been blinded by the light of the four wheeler to the point where they were you know completely because they are nocturnal you don't see cryptids during the day they look fragile like yeah you know they i've never seen them that docile are slow moving before they're usually way fast it could be we were getting a green screen i don't know i doubt it but i've never seen docile cryptids before and those guys were slow like a moving herd of cows rather than these you know monstrously hungry creatures that fly through the forest at 50 miles an hour okay i have a couple of cuts from chara 30 miles an hour but every cryptid i've ever seen is very very quick and can cover a great deal of ground with those legs but i've never seen docile cryptids the long back legs and the front legs the back legs are longer than humans their hips are almost double sets of hips there's a set of hips and then either another set of ribcage and then a ribcage or there's something in between the hips and the ribcage and they've got this mass that elongates their torso which is why they're bent over i mean maybe they're a version of man we don't know anything about they're because we're not the first person so we don't know maybe they're a mistake you know i mean surely they have a botched you know trials or whatever that doesn't you know let's talk about madagascar pigmies i mean they have tiny tiny little humans on madagascar and the reason that they're so tiny is because they were isolated by the breaking up of africa and which is what's going on and on there's another island segmenting off the off the continent of africa as we speak it's about split apart on the escarpment and science has been knowing about that for about five or ten years so you know these isolated islands look at look at australia and the platypus and the kangaroo and all of that and they're completely freakish compared to the rest of the planet and these isolated populations of the the pigmies of madagascar was insane and you go into these caves and they're still finding all these brand new skeletons of micro size to any long or they're finally starting to talk about the elongated skulls and rather than calling them tribal uh manipulated skulls like the flathead american indians used to put a rock on the front of their children's bases to give them platypuses what is something on her phone from a notification telling her that there was some type of movement or activity outside of her look at that eye development now people all are saying this is some type of alien creature somebody did not make that in a california lab no one seems to know that's one of the best puppets i've ever seen so excuse me this could be of a level of real look at the inner eye the edges of the eyewall are weird in depth god pupils yeah that is very real looking peace family i know y'all probably like what is that listen this is at a home i'm not sure exactly where it is but i had a video up before of a bro coming to someone's home in texas now where this home is not really sure but as you could tell whatever this thing is it's huge and not only huge but you could really see it now when i run the video i'm gonna run the video i'm gonna need you guys to look at the top and the bottom now if this thing had on a costume or anything of that nature boy this man or woman that's up in this costume is skinny as hell right the body does not match a human body now i'm gonna run the video but just take a take a look at the face the eyes the legs she's been doing this a while of this thing that's at the door of these people's home now this is a real life home of somebody that's another reason why you walk your doors yeah doors of these people now mind you i'm so happy maybe i need to give me a ring a ring door camera too because these cameras is capturing every single thing now i'm gonna run the video y'all let me know in the comments what y'all think about this i'm telling you i always come with them hit us like follow for share follow me for more because i'm a steady steady bring up yeah she's got some practice okay attention y'all look at the eyes what see how black the eyes is you can't tell me that that's a human bro oh my god look at that look at the body i'm out how they don't match a human can be a standing house is just say and that's in texas that's where tarot is oh tarot you gotta go skinny you gotta move tarot it let me know in the comments what y'all think about this there's no way that that's a costume this is somebody home y'all that this thing has come up to that's a camera look they looking and trying to look in the door type any meat puppets in there oh follow me for more i'll bring up curious like follow me for more where okay i was he just walking down the street like surely other people would see this how did he arrive to that door where'd he come from um is your face cracked outside um crawl out of a hole you know yeah yeah i don't know i don't want to say it's i don't know here's an example how many people see a stray dog walk through their through their neighborhood per week and yet we know those stray dogs do go through our neighborhood every week because there's stray animals running around how many people see cats walk across the street from near your neighbor's yard and yet it happens every day so we you know we're in our busy world we are not we're not looking out our front door like we used to we're not sitting on the front porch like we used to we're busy staring at our phone or watching youtube or you know cramming papers or going to our two jobs right if you're kids or cooked in yeah she was talking about you know how uh these ring doorbells are catching all sorts of you know stuff there was some creepy videos uh showing all sorts of things that shouldn't you know just those eyes move independently those are not robotic eyes those are eyes are moving inside the eye wow and there's like a quarter inch between the main lens and the secondary lens is that that is one of the best costumes I've ever seen or that is quite real this one however looks a little bit less meat real not slimy but those eyes on the on the previous one that that had a the body sheen like it could be an oily thing it doesn't look oily this looks like a dried skeleton that you pulled out of a closet it doesn't have any slime to it Rob thinks it's AI could it just be an AI video yeah this yeah this it doesn't have any shine to it could be or a puppet or something like a marionette or something it moved kind of weird I don't know yeah it it moves like like a stick movement inside the head and the neck moves from side to side not turning that previous one there's movement that's muscle movement this looks more animated this one I would probably say okay maybe AI but either that or it maybe it's real and we and you know blowing it off but the first one looks far more real than this one does I feel like they come out the timing of releasing the AI you know is so perfect because not only do they make all these fake clouds and sky situations but they're going to make it to where people won't know what's real and what's not well remember how many times we we ran into people that were talking about the the fake red plague uh invasion that they were kind of you know and then people said well no it's not really going to happen and what it's going to be is the government going to put us in camps and all of this and then they're going to blame the fake alien invasion and so you know we've been hammered with all of that back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and before you know what people are numb they're they're numb to what the possibility was and they go oh okay it's like AI it's AI it's gotta be AI I don't want to believe it yeah yeah right right we're already there yeah yep um that's why they told you Sam it's not gonna matter what you say nobody will believe you anyway and they already I feel like they already know they've worked decades in they whoever but they do work decades in advance they have a plan as you know planned out far in advance yeah I've been putting 100 it's gonna be there you're putting hundreds of trillions of dollars in a base underground and you don't want to know about your base on underground so they that you have your stash and they don't and they're not going to be banging and we know that the dumb bees are real and we know they're all over the country I've been in one okay um I I've been in one and it's a long elevator ride down and that's spooky in itself just knowing how far deep underground you are they they give everybody that's down under medication to deal with it because it does mess with your head and they keep you a little bit loopy while you're down there working um and that I remember um and and and they don't want you the people to know that you know they're underground with all of everything they ever wanted and all the food supplies they could ever have and all the art treasures and you name it down underground stacked way and trillions of dollars in these open budgets uh they're gonna come up with an awful lot of money to keep hiding that is information as well because they they expect this is why they first started making the dumb bees uh was because they expected uh the Nibiru the destroyer to actually crash into earth uh I don't think their science was uh up to par back then I don't think they had the information I don't think they had smart enough people to working on it I don't think they put the puzzle pieces back together or put together in the first place back then and they've been winging it and trying to get ahead of it and if you look I mean let's talk about Rome as as a an observatory in Arizona and it's called Lucifer so you know there's all kinds of shit going on behind our backs and money money money money money that we a little guy couldn't even tell they know they know that pushes people's fettens you know I mean they they know that that's just going to be like people are going to put their minds you know because it's like colleges millions of dollars to run a study on this and run a study on that and run a study on this and they've got it you know they know how to push buttons on people and how to make them panic and how to make them um you know and we talked about this many shows before and I I say this regularly this is a statement from early Rome uh the best way to enslave people is through comfort yeah okay and uh in back in in the period of Greek in the Parthenon and everything um there was a three to one slave margin between natural citizens of Greece there was three slaves to every free person so uh that economy and how they got things built and all you know had this guy carving stone for you know six months on one piece it's all it's all fits because you know the whole system is is so overly rigged one way or another for those in the who the haves and the have nots and I mean god I could I could I could do a show on that easy just on that on the haves and I have nots throughout history and and the uh the civilizations and the kings and the kingdoms and all of this and god you know lost kingdoms and countries that are no longer even there and including the Arians and people when you when you think when you say Arians people think of Nazis no there was a group of people known as the Arians far before the third riker the second riker the first rike uh that moved in from the Baltic states uh down into India at the climate change of the last cycle and the Arians moved in and that's even where the fallacy that exists today in India about the level and the caste systems literally from the the higher ups all the way down to the untouchables and this is where the fallacy of lighter skin is more valued because that was through the intermixing of the white Aryan race into the Indian populace from India and still carried over you know 2000 years later we're still running on these premises of just in mixed prejudices that base our societal outlook and I mean it's amazing what we run off of and I mean we talk on things like that all these superstitions that we live off of or even you know the beginning of where halloween comes from or where christmas comes from or you know all of these things yeah go ahead but people I mean they create the whole world too as a to divide people is like there's divisions in everything you know and that's perfectly planned out it's so perfect how everything is connected it's I don't think it's human honestly it's too perfect well what you do if you have an enemy and you can't beat them in their own turf what you want to do is you want to divide them so they battle each other sure and they will weaken right and then you won't look at the real enemy right to divide and conquer and that you know these you know Alexander the great to to roam to you know any other cultures and or or let's even talk about the the mongol hordes oh my god at one point in time the mongol hordes and the barbarians and the the the Goths and all of that that did these huge horrendous changes in history and it's it's horrible and people talk about oh how dangerous it is and it's like christ we have us so lucky we don't have the mongol hordes coming in from Asia and we don't have the the the the Pictish warriors and in in uh northern scotland and we don't have the the Goths coming in from France and you know wiping out or the Vikings coming in or the roosts or you know and we we we you know we forget what what what we got here we got here and all of these you know kingdoms and oh god history has been so unfortunately masked and and is only written by the victors and and god you know the horrors that the millions of people that have been killed throughout the century because of crazy wars and famine a lot of it has to do with famine well now we didn't grow any wheat this this year and they did in the next town so let's go to the next town and take their wheat we have to eat and that's you know and prior to the dark ages they were there was believed that generically there wasn't any major war going on modern science western science is starting to believe that there wasn't major Viking invasion or Saxon or Norman invasion it was actually a lot more of just moving and they moved in and mixed and you know the dark ages weren't the dark ages it's just they call it the dark ages because we don't have any history because when the when the Romans left England in 400 or 398 AD after that they called it all the way up to the 10th century they called that the dark ages and what that was is there was a major populace that didn't have reading and writing skills and now it didn't have decent paper everything was written on vellum they didn't have the imports that they had from Egypt which is where papyrus was and of course the Romans used a lot of papyrus because of the of the of the availability of commodities that were shipped around be be a Rome or Greece or the Mycenaeans or or the Hittites or any or the Samarians or the or any of these previous other major cultures that used to ship products around the world when the dark ages hit and they no longer got imports from Asia all the way to England they were cut off and of course science calls that the dark ages and so people believe that it was everything was dead but it wasn't there were people living there the the Saxons moved in the Normans moved in the the Pictish warriors blended in down from Scotland and they came from the Dargerland period which is you know the devastation of Dargerland and nobody knows where the Picts came from and why do they paint themselves blue and that was all this prehistory from from another era and you talk about um Plato and Socrates and those were cario's or cariovers also from the enlightened age prior to and they were young at at children at the time of the of the change of the planetary passing and then they had knowledge and I believe Atlantis is another example where the climate change kicked in and then that was the end of Atlantis because they didn't have their ocean seafaring eye you know the eye of the Sahara that was no longer being filled up with ocean water and rivers because all that changed climate change happened so the the the Atlanteans had to move and then they became the sea people which are accounted for in in Egyptian and roman texts going out throughout history of course they they egyptians talked about the sea people in in literally about a 400 500 year period so that's a lot of different sea people and then nobody really knows who they were but they could have actually been the Atlanteans and you know they could have traveled up and down rivers that are buried under sand right now that we don't even know about and they can see that from satellites with with lidar they can see old past tense underground rivers that still exist um yeah lidar is an awesome awesome tool i love what they're doing in south america discovering out vastly large the mayan and inkon civilization was 10 times larger than anything they imagined yeah you know and you go you go before the inkons were the what the this sumac and all these other uh what i can't think of without one group but they they had art that is highly reminiscent of chinese art and they they had pictures of they had carvings of african noses on some of these people and it proves that they had greater contact with the other continents than modern current history even gives any any indication what they all think they were separate but they wasn't and you know like the the the mayans and the inkons had direct contact with other races as well because oh that for a fact because they had math skills the mayan calendars and and and and equations in astrophysics that we don't average people as humans on earth today even know how to do only if really really smart guys how to do all this crap and so they had to have direct relationship with uh aliens otherwise they wouldn't never have all information of astrology and these math equations that that are absolutely accurate and we still can't do that same math they have to have super computers to do it you know and they had to do a super computer to find out where you know this star was way back you know 18 centuries ago where was this star and and they have computers to do that now but those people back then did it on paper or you know on a you know abacus or whatever and maybe they had computer technology we we know that there was some machine that they found that that one hand turned underwater computer that would uh you'd spin it oh you planetary alignments going up in the future so maybe they had that was calculating machines um look at the at the first chinese water clocks i mean they were huge and they do some unbelievable things and this was 500 bc you know and we looked at this mechanism oh how did they even invent that how did they know these people were way smarter than we give them credit for like i said there's so much more going on than we realized and where we've been manipulated to believe and here we are just workers going to work every day and filling eight to ten hours or 12 hours of our time and giving it for not even a living wage in some cases might have to examine why we are where we are and how we got here i i think something's wrong you know i think there's something really wrong here yeah i think if you're worrying about beating my kids and and you know if we're ever gonna even you know be able to repair the front porch or the roof or this or that or i'm still disappointed about my damn lawnmower about a lawnmower and the piece of shit only worked three times and i can't get it to work it's dead and so i threw 600 bucks out the window for nothing because i can't even get the guy to honor to come back and fix it or return my calls wow yeah you know it's a weird word i mean i can't believe that we're living in the world that we're living in i watch shit on TikTok and i wonder why did they do this right i watch you know the commercials on YouTube and they i i watch 30 seconds of the video and i don't even have any idea what they were trying to sell me it's like what was that about i don't know a bunch of crazy people with really funny costumes and odd makeup and they were jumping around but i don't know what product they were trying to sell it's like subliminal messages and frequencies they're putting in our faces and yeah we're getting slapped with a bunch of disinformation and misinformation and confusion and i kind of have you know i am kind of in the old world going you know some of this crazy shit that is acceptable today we would never behave like in the 50s or 60s or 70s we would never do that publicly and yet that makes it acceptable now it's scary and i mean i i look at some of the outfits that women are wearing in public right now it's like wow uh did you just come out of a strip club um what and that's normal to them it's like whoa my daughter wouldn't go out the front door looking like that no not not happening yeah well we're living in a weird world we're weird weird weird world i can almost talk oh okay my back my chair is telling me i've been sitting here too long and rebecca's playing with the kitties yeah she even got bored now she's playing with the cats it's fun yeah little does she know we're all paying attention to her yeah oh rebecca we're watching you we're listening to your background sounds yeah we're we're at uh almost nine hours and then my gosh i can't believe you about nine hours today yeah and i'm i am definitely feeling it and yeah we did have this chair here so make us make weird sounds rebecca right i'm not sure she had her her headphones on yeah do song. Yeah. Yeah. Black I'm talking about gibberish by now and we're we're talking about spinning circles. I can hear you. I know. Okay. Yeah. I kept saying, can you hear me? Can you hear me? No, you couldn't hear me. So, I was just in the kitchen. I love it. Love it when you all run long. Um but can understand y'all get tired. I know. It's because I start at 8 30 this morning. I wake up and you know, when you wake up to the time the show starts goes real quick, you know? Yeah, I've been sitting in my show. It's almost 12 hours. My show starts at 8 30. Yeah. Right. Um but I was going to say our longest show was 10 hours and 8 minutes. It was six months ago. So, 10 hours, 8 minutes. I think that was the one. I think Nicole was on that show. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that was the show that she was with us on. And some of our newer viewers are probably going to be crazy. After that, it was nine hours and 51 minutes. Okay. And then 9 19 9 0 3 9 0 1. Those are the top five. So, yeah, I, we're at top. We're at number six. Yeah, let's get to number seven. Yeah, let's get somewhere around nine hours. We can, we got three and a half minutes and yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm actually feeling kind of warm and sweaty and I don't think the house is warm. So, I've me been sitting in this chair too long. I know. It feels good to walk around. Yeah, I, I, okay, I try that. We just torture ourselves. Yeah. Oh, and I, you know, I've digressed off the topic five times. And, you know, the crazy ramblings of Sam said, I'm shut up, you know, and I, I chuckle every time I bring that back up, you know, I don't know my, my legs hurt from walking all day. Yeah. The things we put our bodies through to get this information out. I know, I know, I know, I take advantage over time right together, you know, we'll play all week for this moment. Right. Yeah, I do like walking up the hill though, you know, it gives you a better, it gives me a better vantage point of everything. And it's just when I, when I look up the street and realize I got to walk uphill, it's not, I turn the other way and just walk down the block to the church parking lot. So, I finally did it today. Right. I need to get one of those electric bikes that Jillian has or something. Right. Right. That'd be handy. Right. Just to get the information out there real quick. You know, um, but the view is perfect. I mean, is it a full 360 view or is it just the west? Well, it's, you know, that you see there. From the southeast all the way to the northeast and then that mountain is behind me. So, okay. Yeah, you can pretty much get everything. Nate, that's cool. I want to get the view. I don't know if you can hear me. All the way up against the mountain. That's the edge town. We can. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And then the mountain and that's it. I'm giving connection warnings. Oh, uh-oh. Chris, can you hear me? I can hear you. Yep. Can you hear me? Okay. I'm getting, having trouble connecting issues. So, remember that last time they, they booted me off the show when we started talking about it four minutes early. So, I'm, I'm having connection troubles. So, uh, I'll stay as long as they let me but I just figured I'd let you know. I've got the big X screen in front of me right here saying having trouble connecting this often can be caused by unstable internet connection. Yeah. Duh. Yeah. My Wi-Fi is try plugging it into your router. Yeah. Well, okay. Well, I know. I'm having Wi-Fi issues and it's still up. Yeah. I don't see Rebecca at all and she's gone. Maybe they got her booted too. We're going, you guys are, you guys are boring. We're, we're going to boot you. Wow. Yeah. Thank you, Michelle. I can see everybody. I can see in here everybody. Andrea. That's loud. Yes. Yeah. I'm, I'm unfortunately too close to my microphone. Especially when I get concerned that I've got bumped off again and I was thinking, okay, they're going to boot me at the end of the show again like they did a couple of shows ago. So anyway, I can't see the clock because I've got the trouble. They're messing with us. That's right. It's, it's free knowing that they are potentially doing, you know, I, I don't want to believe that there's, you know, this is, you know, we definitely have to be the big they, they are messing, they're messing with us, too. They. Well, and every time I hear somebody say that, I always, I always have to go, who, who is they. No. It's not just here but it's also on tiktok as well. It's the same standard argument about, you know, somebody, I'm not going to go into sovereign citizenship again but I don't know. I watch a bunch of that stuff on TV and she's like, oh my god. Somebody told you that there's this private account with a billion dollars in your name and just because somebody told and they're going to laugh you out of there. And you know, God, it's scary what people don't know. And anyway, yeah, you guys got to find out about these crazy ass passing planets that nobody knows about that are here for a decade now. And this is of course why I was bringing up Beekman's World because I have that one picture that says, duh, never has been here for over 10 years. And it just it amazes me that we've been watching this damn group of planets in the second star for going on 14, 15 years now, and it's still not mainstream. You've got to be kidding me. And then, you know, we're seeing brand new spacecraft we've never seen before. So yeah, yeah, God, those pictures, Chris, they are, I'm pretty sure you got some unusual new spacecraft in that shot. We can investigate that and keep our eyes open. And I will try to find that one picture. I really didn't see much when I was outside. So I'm really excited to look at the pictures. Yeah, yeah, because it was just so damn bright. Yeah, there was a NASA release where they actually off the space station, they released a picture of a ship. And it went viral immediately. And of course, nobody has and I saved a copy of it. But there's a ship with a back deck like a platform, like you were on a boat. And so to me, it just it just screamed that, okay, this is for space walks. This is a deck that you can, you know, take your space suit and and then leap off that thing and leap back on to it, according to, you know, these suits. And they don't have to be tethered anymore, because they got, you know, they have independent jet suits and stuff now. And I'm sure their suits are far better. I mean, they have 11 layers and the damn things weigh 80 pounds. So, you know, I was watching a thing on spacesuits the other day. So you can tell I do some crazy homework sometimes. And looks like we've lost Rebecca altogether. It's weird. Maybe she's having the same. I still have the trouble warning up. It hasn't dropped. And I shouldn't be able to talk, but I apparently can. Try using Chrome if this continues. Yeah, I was like, and I don't use Chrome. I use MSN and Bing. Yeah. Yeah, I don't like Google either. And that could be that could be part of maybe that's why I can't use camera and microphone at the same time. Because I'm not running off a Chrome. Chrome is more of a laptop than PC. And it's an average use in laptop use. And if I would go to Chrome, it would be a pain in the butt to switch everything over. Oh my God. I spent a couple of weeks just trying to, you know, re-get my links back together. So I don't do that. Yeah. I already had enough trouble just trying to get every day done, let alone nerd. And I'm terrible about learning new computer crap. I, you know, I wish I still had Windows 8. Windows 8 worked great. Now I'm at Windows 11, and I'm not happy with it. It's more laid out for phones. And it doesn't do, it does not serve a computer PC. It may work on laptops, I don't know. But for the PC, Windows 11 is far less usable. Windows 8 was great. You could do all kinds of things. And Windows 9, I was, oh God, do I have to? And Windows 10 is, oh God, do I have to do it again? And Windows 11, it came mandatory and everything they were putting out in HP is like, oh shit, I get no choice. I can't buy a computer with Windows 8. I can only buy a computer with Windows 11. And I'm on my 15th computer. Yeah, 15 years, 14 years. Some year, one year, I replaced three computers. One year. Because I bought two cheap ones and one good one. And then the next year and the next one went out, and then another year or two of them went out. So I'm, you know, I'm way ahead on the curve. And, you know, when you, when you buy a cheap computer, they're only going to last two years, if you're lucky. So this is why I always recommend HP. Because HP actually lasts, you know, three to five years. And I had my tech guy come in and he says, oh yeah, all your computers are only going to last three years. I went, Christ, what am I paying this money for? And I guess everybody else has money and I don't. So them, it's no biggie. I'm amazed that I'm still here because the connection signal, having trouble connecting is still up. It has not gone down. I wonder if I shut Facebook down and the tab. MSM tab window closed that down. Maybe it'll clear up. Anyway, um, I, god, I just closed Facebook and I should type to Rebecca to see what she's up to. Huh. She, she, wow, he really, see me. I'm here. I want to, okay. She might be having troubles that I did. This is weird. Weird. Okay. Okay. I'm on Facebook. It opened. No, it's not, chats are not opening. So I am, I'm having bad internet service. Okay. There it is. I see all of you. I know. It's you. I don't see Rebecca at all. I see you. Fine. I only, I only see you and me. Fine. She's not there on. Okay. I sent the okay. I messaged him. I said, I see you. Fine. Oh, she says, I see you. Fine. Fine. Fine. Okay. Yeah. She sent me a screenshot and big flare in the middle of it and yeah, all three of us. And I do not see Rebecca on my stream yard at all. Weird. Anyway, so since you see me fine and we are at the end of the show and we've gone, I can't even see the clock anymore because this, this symbol is in front of it. This is the fourth on the show. So we'll just wind up the show and everybody good night and then we'll see you again next week. Same, you know, bad time, same bad channel and please, you know, drop us a line. Go to YouTube, watch this video, leave a comment tomorrow. Please. We want to hear from you. We want to hear your opinion. I think we can do something better. I want to hear it. If you you know, if you think we're doing bad, let me know. I don't take it personally. I'll take it as important, but I won't take it personally. And I guess we'll just wind down. And then I'll go play Star Wars. Sounds like fun. Okay, I heard a loud sound like Rebecca in the bathroom. Oh my god. I heard you. I don't hear you now. I don't know if she's talking or not. Anyway, so I'm going to go everybody. We will see you really soon. Okay. Okay. All right. Good night. All right. All right. Bye, Chris. Thank you. Bye bye guys. Thank you everybody for showing up and we'll see you next week. All right. All right. Looking forward to it. Bye bye. That was fun.
