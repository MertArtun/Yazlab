 Hello, everybody, and welcome to the latest episode of This Week in Science. We are in the pre-moment of the show when I tell you all that, hey, we're about to do this thing. That's a podcast broadcast. And we're live right now. So there will probably be little blips and blurbs and mistakes, probably because I'm here. And when there are our wonderful editor, Rachel will edit them out for the podcast. So if you want the unedited or the unedited video version, stay here wherever you are. If you want the edited podcast version, find us and subscribe to us this week in Science wherever you find podcasts. Okay, Justin, do you think you're ready to do a show? Yeah. Oh, by the way, sometimes I've never missed a show in episode. But sometimes the podcast audience won't hear me. That's because I've made so many mistakes in editing that they just had to completely edit me out of the show. So what you're getting here, though, is the raw feed. I hope so, because this one, because Claire's not here tonight, you'll be the, it would just be me talking until the interview. Was she? She was just terrible. She had to be edited out even out of the raw broadcast of the show. Rachel's that good. She can do it in real time. Okay, everybody, if you are ready for the show, please share us, please like us, give us the thumbs up, do all the notifications, get us into the algorithms, make sure that we are hitting those search engines for all of the people who are coming into wherever you're viewing, looking for sciencey goodness. Okay, you ready to start? Can I just, on that, can I just, I'm gonna one last side track. Side track. I have, I wrote a story a while ago that got shared a thousand times. Amazing. In the social medias. That translated into almost 400,000 views of one story. So, so every time you share, you're not necessarily just sharing it with one person or one group of people. You can be generating hundreds of additional views, which is what the algorithm is looking for. Like, what was the engagement factor of this? They're not looking for, you know, the searchable words in an audio podcast, but they're gonna look at how many people like saw this pop up in their feed somewhere and took a look at it. So, it's a bigger deal than I think people realize when you just, just put it out there, repost a thing and share it out there. It always helps. It always helps. I'm just a parent right here. No, I'm not. It's time to start our show. Okay, everybody, are you ready for us to begin our show in three, two, this is TWIS. This week in Science episode number 991, recorded on Wednesday, October 23rd, 2024. How much toilet water would you drink? I'm Dr. Kiki and tonight on This Week in Science, we are going to fill your head with ovaries, polar bears, and polarized people, but first... Disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer. The following hour of programming contains science. If you are allergic to science, science has a remedy. If you think science is boring, science will reveal its wonders. If you don't know what science is, science has an answer. If you are afraid of science, science will protect you. If you question science or skeptical about it, science invites your curiosity. If science seems confusing, science can clarify. If you think science is too complicated, science can be super simplified. If science feeds your thirst for knowledge, fuels your imagination, and fills your brain with well-reasoned thinking, you've come to the right place, because we have all of that and more here on This Week in Science coming up next. With new discoveries that happen every day of the week, there's only one place to go to find the knowledge I seek. I want to know what's happening, what's happening, what's happening This Week in Science. What's happening, what's happening, what's happening This Week in Science. Good science, you hee hee. And a good science to you too, Justin and everyone out there. Unfortunately, Blair is not joining us this week for the show, but we'll be talking about her polar bears. Yes, they're her polar bears. Happy Molday, everyone. It is. 10 to the 23rd, right? 6.022 times 10 to the 23rd. You know what that number is? Avocados number? No. Avogados number. I'm going to have to go back to, they've been adding a few people been claiming numbers. Now that it's like a name generator out there. Intranged Avocados number. Yeah, I don't know. There must be. Oh, AI is taking over. These little mistakes, the blips in space time in the fabric of our reality. No, no, no. This is This Week in Science. And thank you, everyone, for joining us for this episode. We are really glad that you are here and we have a great show ahead, including an interview with Pepperdine University professor Dr. Steve Rouse on learning to love toilet water or at least to learn how to drink it without complaining. We also have. Before we get into this too deeply, I want everybody who had any kind of visceral reaction to understand that all water that you encounter in this world was at some point somebody else threw that water. Like from fish to bacteria to any other organism that has been on this planet. That water has passed through or been used as toilet water. So yeah, don't get too hung up. You think it did. This concept is the it's not all new water. Are we having this conversation now? No, we're going to wait for our guests to join us. Before we get our shock factors too high up, it's all toilet water. It's toilet water all the way down. Okay, I got it. I have stories tonight about Tasmanian Tigers, simulating social media, and the best human bias ever. What do you have for us, Justin? Oh my goodness. I actually wrote down the things that I brought. What do I have? I have oh my goodness. This is going to be fun. Real-time ovulation. You? No. What? Yeah, I brought it. I brought the ovulation. You brought it. Good. Thank you. And then separate stories. Dulas, study on Dulas found them massively improving health outcomes. It's a Medicaid study, which is going to be important because it just recently got expanded. And maybe a silver lining of global warming. And we're without Blair. So I've also got a few other things that I pulled up that we may get to if time permits. Yeah. All right. I would ask Blair what's in the animal corner. She was going to talk about polar bear paws. And maybe I'll bring the story up without as much detail as she was going to before the end of the show. But right now I want to let you know that if you are enjoying the show, you don't have us already subscribed and everything. If you want to do that, find us as this week in Science Podcast, wherever your favorite podcasts are found. And we broadcast live weekly on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch, Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Pacific time-ish. But you can find all the information at our website, twist.org. Time for the science. Let's bring it. All right. So this story I did bring because Blair was going to be here tonight. And I figured it would be a fun little, I don't know, a little needle for both of you. But we've been talking about de-extinction for a long time on the show. Colossal, the company that's been trying to restore the mammoths. They've also talked about de-extincting the dodo. And recently, the thylacine. And Blair loves the thylacine. The thylacine is the Tasmanian tiger. Or more accurately, because it's not a tiger species, it's more closely related to wolves and dogs, the Tasmanian wolf. So Colossal has been working with University of Melbourne and researchers at, in a lab there that's working on specifically marsupial species run by a researcher named Andrew Pask. And they announced several advancements, not through publications, not through peer review, but in a South by Southwest Australia panel discussion this last week. The timing, interestingly, coincides with the launch of their Colossal Foundation, which is raising money for investment. And that they say will be spent to rapidly deploy to help with extinctions and research around the world. So it's an interesting thing. It's science by press release-ish. It is not, this so far hasn't been peer reviewed. And we do hope that it will be peer reviewed. But what they say they've been doing is really fascinating. Number one, they have been working in this de-extinction process on the genome of a related species of marsupial that they are going to be using. And they're actually starting to use to bring the Tasmanian tiger back. The researchers have been trying to work on this related species and make sure, see what the specific genetic differences are so that they can basically genetically modify it and turn it into a Tasmanian tiger. And this species is called the Fat-Tailed Dunnert. I love species names in Australia. So the Fat-Tailed Dunnert is most closely related to the Tasmanian tiger, has like 99% or 99.9% relatedness. And the exciting part of what they've been working on here is that they have developed new methods to, or they are developing new methods to do genome editing at multiple points without massive amounts of off-target effects. Off-target effects are the changes in the genome that you don't want to be happening in places where they might have conditions, deletions, these sorts of things. And so far in this, in genetic modification, whether CRISPR or any other methodology, you don't usually have it happening in lots of places at the same time. It's usually at very limited locations and very highly controlled. So if this technology were to become actually applicable, it might have influence and application in all sorts of genetic modification for many different species for reproductive purposes. I'm not pointing at my own head right now. No, I don't need any genetic modification. Oh, I do. So one of the things, I don't know if I mis-surge you or just want to clarify, this is not related to canine species at all. It's a marsupial. It is a marsupial. It looks like a wolf. It looks like a wolf. It looks like a wolf. That's right. You're right. But it is not related any more to a wolf than it would be to a tiger or a dolphin. Right? Less closely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's a young adult. That's why I think it was always so fascinating. Because if you look at it, you're like, that's a canine. That's a dog or a wolf species for sure. Yeah. And the reason I said the more... It's a convergent type of an evolution. But that makes their job more difficult because you could use a wolf or a fox or some kind of canine species to infill if you're missing data or something like this. Kind of like the woolly mammoth they're doing with the elephant. Like, our missing sections of woolly mammoth DNA. So we can use a close... Yeah. So let me move on from this because this is what they've been doing because of the convergent similarity of these animals to the canids. The jaw and skull morphology is similar in its length and breadth. The thylacine craniofacial shape, they've been analyzing genetic segments that are related to how the face develops. And they messed with the whole bunch of regions of the genome and what they call thylacine wolf accelerated regions. And they predict that they will drive similarities between thylacine and wolf. They've tested them, these gene segments on knock-in experiments in mice. And they found the mouse skull moved in predicted ways and confirmed the drivers of head shape and the changes that would happen there. So they're starting to put those genetic edits into the fat tailed Dunnert embryos. And then additionally, they found a head in a jar at a museum of a thylacine's head. And it's really grotesque in a preserved head, but they could take tissue from the head and they sampled it. We're able to get the most complete genome of a thylacine to date. They are only missing a few segments in between bits and pieces. And they think that they can fill those in based on understanding of this relation between morphology and function. And they think they can fit it in. That said, they also were able to get mRNA, messenger RNA, which is indicative of the bits of the genome which are being translated into proteins within the head region. So they believe that they have markers telling them which proteins were being turned on or were active before this individual in the jar died for the muscles, for the eyes, for the brain, that these little bits of instructions would have been relevant. And that this is important for understanding how a living animal should be. This is not to say that they are there yet. This is not to say it's peer reviewed, but there's a whole bunch going. They also want to put cane toad resistance genes into their thylacine remake because there's too many cane toads in Australia and they don't want to. You're creating a food network web that eliminates an invasive species. That's very clever. And that will probably then of course allow them to get tremendous funding. Yes, they're also going to, and if they are able to get a resistance gene, they can breed into the quaka, which is another predatory animal that eats the cane toad and is becoming, is endangered at this point because of how many cane toads they have eaten and died from. Yeah, that they might save the quaka as well. I find the convergent evolution genetic portion of this very fascinating. It's one thing that's, it's an evolutionary trait, the long snout. You can actually see it with tigers and lions. If you compare the two, you see that lions have a longer snout. Don't tigers have a longer snout? No, tigers have a very short snout compared to the lion's sort of projected face. Now I need to look at pictures. Yeah. And what the, those differences are, especially if you look through lots of species, different species and where they exist, tigers are very, you know, of the cat family have like the longest. They're also the most prominent planes hunters. So what they've found is it has to do with, partly to do with the distance vision and having that snout. How those two correlate to the evolutionary path, but it tends to be open planes, animals that are predators especially, but have these longer snouts versus more jungle or condensed area tends to have flatter faces. It has to do with the long range vision. Yeah. Yeah. And so, and so that makes, it didn't, it did not occur to me at all that, that you could actually potentially use convergent pathways like that to control morphology. It's very fascinating. Hopefully though, if they have a head and a jar and they have a pretty decent genome that they might not need to, to borrow for those traits, but it is, it is a very fascinating idea that you could have convergent DNA, not just trait. And I was, once again, I was incorrect. I said, quaca, it's the qual, cute little species that I'm very sad to be sharing is becoming endangered because of cane toads. Look at this cutie pie. No. It can't, it needs to be able to protect itself from the cane toads. It needs to be able to eat toads. Yeah. The question is now, you know, does the, does this company colossal, they say they have, they want to help save the species that may go extinct, right? To help us if we can't change our ways to protect and save species that we cause to go extinct in the near future. Based on the things that they find. I wish that it were not as much of a company company colossal is, but they have to make money. It's an interesting, it's an interest. This is the interesting balancing point between science and industry or science and private or market. And I am questioning. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm unfamiliar. And so this is probably a wrong time to bring this up because you might be unfamiliar. And then we're just like, oh, I don't know. Go look it up. Has colossal done anything? I feel like colossal has been raising funds for 235 million dollars and some like 13 labs or something like that around the world that they're collaborating with. They have published a couple of studies and they are working towards things. I don't know whether this has already resulted in patents or any intellectual property that would be valuable at this point. But that I think is what the concern is that they're not creating intellectual property that will be public domain if they're not publishing and not undergoing peer review. So I don't know. Yeah. I'm interested. I'm following along and I'll keep everyone posted to what I learned. But I think it's very fascinating. We're not going to get a Tasmanian title. I'm very fascinated with the idea of using convergent evolution. I also don't think of a word. I also think like, yeah, but you're talking about developmental triggers of growth and bone and things like, like, it's like, I can see. Yeah, but craniofacial morphology is different from, we have convergent evolution to a similar shape and function. And that is, as they're seeing, probably driven by very related genes. There are certain genes that way back when became the drivers of form. And we know, we know what a lot of them are, how they are related and how they work specifically during development in various species is the interesting question. And then again, this marsupial species, what are they going to do when the baby Tasmanian tiger slash fat tail Dunnart is ready to not be born yet, but is a little marsupial baby who wants to be in the pouch? Do they have a marsupial pouch? What are they working on? This is good technology. Tell me something else, Justin. You want to show me what it's like to ovulate? Let me, let me teach you about ovulation. So this is, this story is basically just a cool video on one, on one level. The other is, this is from the Max Planck Institute of Multidisciplinary Sciences. They created a live imaging method that basically uses my microscopy to do a time lapse. They did a 24 hour X vitro. So in a lab, they grew mouse ovaries. And with this new technique that they've designed, they captured the process at 10 minute intervals over 24 hours. And it allowed them amazing, amazing detail of information. I don't know if you have the link there, if you can pull up a video for the streaming audience to figure out. But basically, they also made tremendous discoveries in this. So normally when you're doing these tissue studies, ovaries are kind of difficult to study. They're hard to get at where they are. And you have to have the timing, like exactly right. For the, sorry, for the ovulation. It's basically a very quick process of releasing the egg. And getting this live imaging, instead of having samples that are in slices of time, where you have captured an ovary in some stage of development, and then you can study it at this point, or at that point, or of the egg. You actually got to see the entire process. So it came in three phases. It is beginning to be released from the skin tissue, the follicle. Where is my, I have to go and look for my, yes. So it is, there's a follicle expansion, then it contracts, ruptures, and then the egg is released. And it manages to capture all of this. It's amazing. So I'm guessing this was, they had eggs in a dish, probably donated. And no, these were, these are mouse eggs. Great. Donated by mice. Yes. And these are transgenic mice, so that they have, you know, the coloration, they have markers that allow it to show up in the imaging. But with this, they were also able to compare it to levels of different chemical releases at different time points. And that gave them an idea of what was driving the process of ovulation. And then they did knockout models of each of these chemicals to confirm that they were a causal role. And their knockouts would prevent this, that, or the other from happening. And so they basically got a, not just a nice video, they actually did answer a lot of questions, or confirm a lot of theory about how ovulation works. So really a remarkable, a remarkable study, which is, you know, like the core of this, it's just lab tech. These images were captured using a combination of con focal and two-photon microscopy. They did this live imaging over the 24 hours, plus they were also able to, you know, do chemical testing at the different stages, because this is in a, this is lab dish created, so they have access to these. Yeah. So I think, you know, yeah, so the interesting thing is putting all the pieces together to make this possible within the lab, but then, you know, starting to get at what, what questions is this going to answer? And how is this going to advance maybe, you know, problems with ovulation when, you know, why do you get ovarian cysts? Why do some, you know, why do some ovulations go bad? Why do you release so many eggs sometimes? Like, there's so many individual questions that can go a little bit deeper into looking at the, the various layers of data that they've put together here. Yeah. And it gives, it gives a causal chemical release, hormone release interactions for each of the stages of, like the three stages that they, they point out, and then the actual rupture has its own three stages built within that. Each one triggered by something. And so, and so knowing what all of the mechanisms are, then you can interrogate within a human model. Are we, are we missing one of these? Do we have a genetic variant that is preventing one of these releases? Like, I mean, yeah, some part of this. And because you've seen all of it in the time lapse process, you, you know, what should be happening when, and when it doesn't. Something that is almost impossible to do when you have a sample and say, Oh, this looks like it's at that time point. And we can study what seems to be going on at this time point. Now you have the full picture. It's really, really fascinating. That is super cool. More stuff. I want more videos of things that usually happen inside the body. I think that would be cool. Let's make that stuff visible. It would be so great. So good. Unfortunately, Blair's not here to talk about this, but people are looking at polar bears. We worry about polar bears these days as they are the so-called canary in the coal mine of our Arctic area and the melting ice caps. Apparently a new study published in Ecology, the Ecological Society of America's Journal, Scientific Naturalist, Stephen Atkinson and Kristen Ladra are publishing their work, Icing-related injuries in polar bears at high latitudes. So polar bears, who we normally think of as being able to just jump and run across the ice and they've got the thick pads and they've got lots of fur and everything's supposed to be perfect for their adaptation to that environment. This is the first time that injuries to the feet, skin ulcerations, ice buildup, hair loss, lacerations have been reported. Apparently two bears had ice blocks up to one foot in diameter stuck to their foot pads, which made it difficult for them to walk. So this is probably a result of this transition in our climate and so understanding how the melting ice and refreezing of the ice is affecting the animals that live on the ice and their ability to function and survive is incredibly important. They have looked at these bears in two different populations in the Arctic between Canada and Greenland and they've found numbers of bears that have lots of ice balls stuck to their feet, these lacerations. The bears aren't happy. That's where we're ending up. I feel like we talked about this a long time ago, but one of the things that prevents that in all kinds of polar species is having these hairs on the paws. They have hairs on the paws. But I'm wondering if they're not as developed now, or do you think it's just the ice is changed? Because one of the things that also that came up in all of this was that it was an epigenetic factor that it could have been sourced in the prenatal hormone release from the mother and that it was likely because of a more relaxed, less stress hormones. And so if those stress hormones are rising and it's affecting development that could be affecting the hair follicle deployment on the paws, and then therefore you would have what we're seeing. There's also another report that's out from in close one. It's showing that toxoplasmosis is up in polar bears, that they're actually a number of pathogens that they're encountering. Maybe because they previously had not. It's interesting. The authors for this study hypothesized that it's all related to climate warming, rain on snow events, creating moist slushy snow that freezes onto the paws of the animals, warm spells causing melting and then refreezing. And then maybe this is the third is that the populations live on what's called fast ice connected to the land near where freshwater glaciers meet the ocean. And that this means that seawater seeps up into the snow and that allows the snow to clump on the bear's feet and cause ice. I feel like they've been doing that for a while. I feel like the third one is probably the least likely hypothesis. But what do we know? I don't know. You know, I've never studied a polar bear up close and I hope never to. I will not be doing that myself either. This is This Week in Science. Thank you everyone for joining us. We are here. If you are enjoying the show, if you are enjoying the show. I love it.

Are we ready to come on back for more This Week in Science? Yeah. Okay, everyone, I would love to take this opportunity to bring our guest for the evening, Dr. Steven Rouse. Steve, it's Steve, not Steven. He's pulling him, Steven, but we're kind of calling Steve. It's gonna happen. Either way is great. Dr. Rouse is Professor of Psychology at Pepperdine's Siever College with diverse research interests from religiosity to personality tests to open science and most recently, what people are willing to drink. Thank you for joining us this evening. Thank you so much for letting me come. I'm really excited to talk about a project that has been one of the most eye-opening and enlightening and exciting projects I've had a chance to take part in in recent years. It's been really fun. Yeah, I'm excited about it. I was really interested in the idea behind the study because there are so many things we're coming up against these days. Socially with, you know, what are people going to accept as things change in our world? And, you know, how do we talk to people about things? And, you know, I think stuff like drinking water is incredibly important. Absolutely. I thought this was fascinating. And before you jump into the study, though, can you start with, okay, basic overview of your diverse interests and how did you go from this diversity of things that you study into this one particular question? Yeah, so I've kind of joked that I'm, well, not really joked. I've kind of, I've come to the realization that I have a short attention span. And so I love being at a place like Pepperdine where I'm not really necessarily expected to stay on the same research agenda year after year after year, where I have a little bit more freedom to be able to pursue one topic. And then if I get to the end of that topic, I go, Oh, that looks like an interesting thing over there. And then I get to wander after something else and then, Oh, and so I enjoy getting a chance to explore where my interests are and also to explore where my students' interests are. It's been really fun in recent years to be talking with students in class. And if a question comes up, it's exciting to be in a discipline where we can't, we don't just go, I wonder, but we say, Okay, well, let's find out. Let's, let's gather data, find out about that. So my research background kind of wanders all over the place. I think that's, but it's, it's interest, your, your, your overall interest is human psychology and that's right. What makes us tick. Exactly. Exactly. Awesome. Okay, so I got a quick question because you mentioned the personality test. Yes. What does it say about me or somebody Well, let's say I have a friend. That's too late. Hypothetically. Yeah. Hypothetically. Hypothetically. What does it say about a person when they're terrified of taking a personality test? What it says is that we've elevated the importance of personality tests up above where they should be. I know I study personality tests. That's one of my primary interests, but I think a lot of times we've acted as though personality tests can tell deep dark secrets about a person that no one else will know. The reality is a good personality test can, can describe you about as well as a good friend might be able to describe you, but because we've, we've developed this mystique and this stigma about, or this, this mystique about what a personality test can do that it kind of intimidates us. So you are not alone or the, the friend you're talking about is not alone. Yeah. The friend, no, this friend apparently worked at a major retailer. Okay. Years and years ago. I think they're still in business, but, but part of getting into the management program was a 50 question, basically personality test that had, you know, it's four categories of answers all the way through the thing. But I was just like, my goodness. And at some point I'm actually being made to make moral choices. Do I do the empathetic answer? Or do I do the reasoned answer? And there's an imaginative answer that's the creative one, but maybe they don't want that. And then like, then you're overthinking it, but then you're also making like, these deep philosophical choices within yourself. Am I empathetic? Or am I purely a logical creature? And you have to keep like, it was, it was very demanding. For people who think about how they think and how they think about answering questions on tests, it becomes a very meta. It wasn't, it wasn't just like, ah, that seems like the right answer. Like each one I was like, oh, this is a deep moral ethical, this crossroads fork in the road that I've come across that I now must pick a path for my future mental states. And then, and then they have the disclaimer, but this questionnaire is not going to be used to tell whether or not you should work here. This one was very definitely like, this determines your future in this kind of how it was presented. But it was, it was like, like I said, it was like 50 questions, but there were really only four category of questions that they asked in over and over again, in multiple different ways, weighing them against the other components in that, in that survey. So I'm always, I'm always, every time I, I now don't take them ever since, but I'm always terrified. It's like, oh, I remember, I have this like trauma of all the choices. Yeah, yeah, I totally get that. I totally get that. I think I'm indoor, outdoor, ABCDEFG. That's my, sorry, I'm making fun of various tests right now. Yeah. Okay. So, Steve, you were going to tell us about your, about your various interests that you're working on currently or you have worked on? Yeah, so it's, it's covered anything that, anything that I or my students in my classes find interesting. And so the classes that I teach include like personality, psychological testing, human sexuality. And in those classes, we come up with some really, really fascinating, I wonder topics and then get to go off and explore them. This study, though, was an entirely different kind of project where it basically came to me. And I was so grateful that it did, because the local water district had some questions that they wanted to ask. And so they connected up with me to see if I would be willing to independently collect data, independently run some analyses and answer some important questions for them. So I was really grateful to them, because this was an interesting topic that I didn't know I was interested in until I became interested in it, until I became invited. I and my colleagues became invited to work on this project. So got a chance to work two psychologists, two ecologists working together, along with one person who worked at the water district itself to be able to answer some questions about how to help people become more accepting of purified recycled water. So here's some, so that doesn't sound hard. But when you state like that, then it's just like, what do you think about purified recycled water? We have so many people have purifiers. We have what could be wrong with that? Why did that mean a messaging check? We have tap purifiers. So people are familiar with purified water. But what is the recycled aspect? I mean, gray water, and turn it into drinking water, right? That's what I would think. Yeah. Oh, is there more than that though? I mean, is it waste wastewater systems, not just gray water, but like the full wastewater recycling? Okay, yeah. So I'm coming to you from Southern California. I'm on the Pepperdine campus in Malibu. Where there's fire, it's just constant fire. Yeah. And actually, that's very relevant to this, that we go through periods of drought. But let me back up a little bit. If I were to go right now and pour some water down the drain, that water would be a process to make it safe to be put back into the environment to be poured out into the streams and rivers. And that would eventually get to the ocean. But that's a lot of water that is being lost. That's a lot of water that is being wasted. Because here in Southern California in the LA area, we've got a major city in an area that does not have access to a very large amount of groundwater. About a third, my understanding is, now keep in mind, I'm a psychologist. I'm not a water scientist. I've become very educated about this, but coming to you from the perspective of a psychologist, but apparently about a third of the water that is used in Southern California comes from local groundwater. The majority of it either comes to us from Northern California, or it comes from the east, through the Colorado River. And so a lot of the water that we're drinking here in Southern California is flowing past communities and farms that would love to have access to that water. And we're as a city that is continuing to grow, that's not sustainable to have us use the water once and then just dump it into the ocean. And so the local water district is beginning a process by which they're going to begin using purified recycled water as part of the water source for tap water. So the way this system is going to work is that as the water gets processed once to the level that it could be released back into the environment, released back into the rivers and streams, it's then going to go through a three-stage process. There's like an ultra-filtration process, there's a reverse osmosis process, and then there's an ultraviolet oxidation process. So the water becomes completely pure. And so in fact, I've got some of the water with me right now, a colleague at the water district who are willing to give me some of the water. This water is the purest water I've ever drunk. It's amazing to drink something of the kind of comparison. I remember when I was really young, one time went to the Carlsbad Caverns, and if you've gone to a big cave, you may have had similar kind of experience where they turned the light off, and there's no light at all, and you experience for the first time true darkness. Drinking this water is kind of like almost the gustatory equivalent of the visual experience of having no light. It's bizarre to drink something that has absolutely no taste, because then you realize I've been tasting things in the water that I've been drinking until now. And so in fact, this water is so pure that if you drink nothing but it, it's so pure it would actually begin leaching calcium out of your bones because it's that pure. I was going to say, it needs to have the minerals in there. Exactly, exactly. So once it goes through this three stage process, becomes incredibly pure, it then gets released into the local reservoir. And my understanding is that once it gets released, an individual water droplet would take roughly two to four months to go from where it gets released to the place where then it gets pulled back out again. And so it has a chance to mix with the water that does come down from Northern California in this natural reservoir or in this in this reservoir, then it's treated again to EPA standards, and it is drinkable, consumable. So the technology works, the technology, this technology is not new. This is technology that works and has been around for a long time. I mean, if you think about it like the space station has been using recycled water for decades, there's not springs of pure water up in space. And there's lots of other communities that have been using this kind of technology, but people kind of have a knee jerk reaction when they hear about this was water that at one time had been waste. And so the Las Virginas Water District decided they really wanted to invest time, money and effort into getting the community comfortable with the idea of this before it went live. And so they contacted me to evaluate the effectiveness of some of their educational programs. So that's kind of a drawn out origin story for the for the study. Does that all make sense so far? Yeah, absolutely. And being from Northern California, and having lived in Southern California, I can tell you one, Northern California, it's not just straight from the Sierras down to Southern California. There's all kinds of farmland and everything else that you're going to experience. And it's not sent in underground piping, it's sent in these big above ground trenches. Aqueducts. So that water is already getting exposed to all sorts of human influenced environments on the way down, which I think that I think the part that was fat and oh, from being in Southern California, I didn't even know people drank tap water. I never saw that. But but the next questions, but yeah, that part that you mentioned about reintroducing it to the reservoir as the method of not only gaining the mixing with and sort of gaining the mineral content, but then going through the normal process of purification that would take from the water. That's the sort of the was the missing link in my head about how do they get from, yes, you can do this, you can purify the water, but then how do you get it back up to a drinking standard? And that makes total sense now that you would you would just reintroduce it to the natural environment where you're pulling it from in the somewhat natural in the reservoirs as the mix as the premix. And that's that's brilliant. Actually, it really is. Yeah. Yeah. So but thinking about the people who are drinking the water. So like Justin said, who drinks tap water in Southern California? You know, they're bottled water or they're whatever. So did you have any did you ask people as they came in what where they got their water, what their thoughts about their water were ahead of time? You know, do they think about where their water comes from? Did you ask these kinds of questions as you came into the study? Not those kinds of questions. Those would be good questions to ask about because yeah, a lot of times we don't think about where the water comes from. I grew up in even though I'm in Southern California now, I grew up in Denver. And I used to always think about, you know, that I'm drinking this pure mountain water. Exactly. Exactly. But then I started to realize when I was in high school, wait a minute, the town of Georgetown is upstream from here and there's another Idaho Springs is upstream from here and thinking, okay, actually, I'm drinking water that has already gone through several communities first before it actually came to me. So, you know, earlier, Justin, you said at the top of the show, you talked about how all water is reused water. And that's absolutely true. Not even talking about all the water that then gets evaporated and rained down again, even the water that comes in a stream goes past different communities is reused, is used and then passed on to someone else. We're just kind of in an area where the last, any water that gets down the drain doesn't really have any other communities further downstream. And that's such a waste for that water just to be lost. And so how much water is going to keep coming there so you have to plan for the future, right? Exactly. Because we are in a drought prone area. And so the Los Virginas Water District invested money to get and got some great grants to be able to create a demonstration center. And so this is like a mini version of the whole water treatment plant that is eventually going to go online. And so this treatment plant or this demonstration center is available for people from the community to be able to come and visit and to be able to walk through the process of seeing this three stage purification process. And then at the end of the, at the end of the process, they get a glass of water and can actually try some of the purified recycled water. And there's just a really powerful experience of being able to drink it and realize how pure and how perfect it tastes. So what we were doing is that we would test people in their attitudes about purified recycled water. And we actually conducted two studies, the team conducted two studies. The first study was a standard pre-post study. We had a group of participants come to the water demonstration center, took a test to measure their attitudes about purified recycled water, and the attitudes were pretty diverse. But then they went through the demonstration center, and then at the end they were asked to take that same test again and to give it a chance to drink some water. And if I don't move around enough, my lights go out. You may see me every now and then having to do that. So at the end of the tour, though, their attitudes were substantially higher than they were at the beginning. In fact, every single person was willing to drink water at the end of the tour. And so the second study we conducted was a randomized experiment where half of the sample was able to go through the tour and able to get the educational experience and then take the test of their attitudes of purified water, whereas the other sample or the other half of the sample just simply took a second test of the purified recycled water attitude and dramatic difference in the acceptance of it. And so we were able to see twice that this demonstration center works. There's a powerful experience in being able to see it for oneself and be able to realize, now, this is good. This works. So the people that were there, though, did you see them as they were doing the study and see like, oh, they're hearing about, wait, is there a cycle? And did they have like funny faces? Like the test faces? Or like, was there and was there a change with that education? Yeah. So even when I even when I tell my students about this, every now and then when I talk about the whole nature of the project, I see students give that kind of disgust expression. And so we did actually have a component to this study that we wish that it had worked, but we didn't really, frankly, I'll just be honest, I didn't think through one element of it before the study went live. We had had some software that can measure subtle facial muscle movements, especially those facial muscle movements related to different emotional experiences. And so the idea was that we might be able to see whether a person's facial expressions might show more indication of disgust if they hadn't gone through the tour than if they had gone to through the tour. Like I said, though, we, I didn't really think through one element of it enough and we didn't do enough pilot testing because as people are raising a glass to their mouth to sample it, walking part of the face that shows the disgust. Exactly. Exactly. But we even in the randomized experiment, people drank the water and people were, in fact, in both groups, people were willing to drink the water. And it was exciting to see how much the attitudes had changed. So something that you alluded to before we've been talking about when being in high school in Denver, in high school, I was, I lived, I grew up in a town that had well water. Back then it was exclusively well watered. It tasted terrible because it had high mineral content like beyond. But my concept of wastewater treatment plants was that they treated the water and then released it back into the water ecosystem. So in LA it makes sense, especially like Malibu. I remember not being able to swim in Malibu or down to Santa Cruz because there was a wastewater plant that had ruptured and there was sewage getting sent out and it will pipe into the ocean that's normally sending out the purified water. What happens in Linn with all of the wastewater treatment plants? Because those are already treating the water that's been used for sewage and everything else was sewage at one point or tap water going down the drains, what have you. Where does that, where does all that water go? That's a good question. Remember you have a psychologist here, not the water scientist. If you're like 200 miles inland it's not like there's a pipe running all the way to the ocean to get rid of everything. There are a lot of rivers and tributary, there are lots of places. But right, these are the rivers that then are being used as drinking water downstream from it. So aren't we already doing this? Because again in high school I assumed that's what a wastewater treatment plant was, was cleaning the water so that we would put it back into the system. Yeah, to be honest I don't know. I know that here it's just released into the streams. Maybe it's just an LA. I have no idea. Right. And I do know that's how it is in Colorado too. My dad is a hydrogeologist and so he and I had a chance to, just to be honest sometimes he and I don't have a lot to talk about. So this actually was a really great project. I was able to connect it in an unexpected way. So I know that in Colorado that is a big part of it, that it's released also into the rivers after it's processed. But yeah, I don't know. I spend a little bit of time living in West Texas. And so I know exactly what you're talking about about the well water. Different kind. Yeah. And it's where you can actually see things, see lime floating in it. Oh my goodness. Yeah. Or the, you know, the faucet, every faucet had this. So here where I am in Portland, Oregon, the anecdote up here is that we just, we are still working and continue to work on the big pipe project where they are replacing a lot of our sewer pipes because in the winter when the big storms come, they push all of the sewer pipes out in those overflow. The overflow is into the Willamette River. The Willamette River goes into the Columbia River and that, you know, people fish, there's all sorts of stuff. And there for a very long time has been a lot of disgust about swimming in the Willamette River. You do not, you don't catch fish. And so it's a big, been a big project to clean up the river. And so the big pipe project has more capacity, make sure that it doesn't overflow. And they're actually taking that wastewater and then dealing with it and treating it. And so then, yeah, it's a whole new situation. But there's the disgust in the environment, the environment that you're in and the water and where it goes. You know, everyone knows the quote unquote LA River, which they've been working on making better. Not so dangerous. But then there's the water you drink. And we, and I'm wondering if this part is part of the acceptance or the advertising campaigns that have been used to sell people water. It's from nice places, the bottled water, the things that you buy, right? And so your people think the bottled water that they're buying is actually cleaner and better for them than the water that comes out of their taps. And it's actually less regulated. And it's less, you're right. You know, the, it's a huge deal. I don't know. Do you have any, like, do you have any further like questions about like this psychology of the, you know, acceptance of, you the water we're drinking and, you know, what, what people seem to be willing to accept or not? Yeah. And why? You know, there's, I want to give a shout out to someone whose research I really, really admire. I've never met him, but Paul Rosen is at University of Pennsylvania. And he's done some amazing research on, on just human disgust and the disgust reaction. And, you know, discuss, human disgust is fascinating that it, it probably was so beneficial to our species back helping our species survive the Pleistocene era, you know, to, to be a species to recognize maybe we shouldn't use the bathroom close to our food source and water source. You know, we, that was probably really helpful for us to have the ability to, to be disgusted. But evolution kind of rewards survival more than rewards rightness. And sometimes some of the products of evolution may actually not be logical. And we may have some disgust reactions, even when that's not really rational or realistic. And so I know that Rosen and his colleagues did one study that I found really fascinating where he went through several different stages of asking people whether or not they'd be willing to drink. For instance, one part sewage mixed with a thousand parts pure water. And most people can, not that, but then what about, what about if it's purified and goes through a pipe to your faucet? Well, the pipe isn't enough to purify it. But if it goes 100 miles down the fast flowing river, yeah, sure. Or if it, you know, gets mixed in with a lake, yeah, sure, I guess that, that would be fine. And so through this series of questions, was able to see what are the processes by which disgust can be overcome? Because disgust, we, there's a concept called contamination permanence, that once we think of something as contaminated, it doesn't become non contaminated. Unless there's something powerful to overplay it. So like, this is a study that I always feel like I have to take a big dose of, of suspension of disbelief about it. But if there in one study, people were asked to think about, what if you have this sweater, and this, you find out that this sweater had once been owned by Adolf Hitler, would you wear it? Well, people say, no, I would not. But what if you find out that this first one, yeah, it's just the almost the evilness contaminating the sweater. But what if then after it was owned by Hitler, Mother Teresa wore it, and people, that's even worse. Oh my gosh. Yeah, no, absolutely not. Big suspension of disbelief on that about what was the, a homicidal dictator and the world's worst con artist combined. But anyway, how we talk about it. People generally are more accepting of it in that condition. And so that's actually, that's actually technically, that was Mother Teresa's role. Her biggest, her biggest donors were dictators and despots who needed to clean their image. And that's, that's where she received huge donations to go meet with Pinuche or whoever the dictator of the day was, or whoever needed cleaning up of their image after an ethnic cleansing event or a suppression of democracy. Mother Teresa would show up and be like, Hey, look, we're friends. And we get huge donations. You should tell this story. And then we should repeat the study. And then we'll see how the results of the study change. Does it know the holy affine effect that it did before? Yeah. So yeah, like this is, this is really fast. So there's also, there's an element, there's a story I'm going to talk about later on the show about doulas. This spoiler, the Cessarian deliveries were 47% lower for Medicaid patients who were assigned doulas. Now the doulas are not medical practitioners. What they're providing is information. They're answering questions. They're doing some patient advocacy, but they're, they're really explainers. You know, and helpful hints like, you know, bring this go bag with you, but also sort of translating what the doctor is saying when it's not immediately understood. And I'm kind of seeing like the correlation here where once people had the basic education of what to expect and what concerns were not actually going to be relevant with this, that it changed their attitudes. And it changes the outcomes then of people accepting these things. Yeah. But you know, what, what amazes me is that there's some things that are harder to get over than other things. Like for instance, the idea of purified recycled water still causes a knee jerk reaction for some people, whereas we have entire communities that still are drinking water that flows through lead based pipes. And here we have contaminants that have been empirically shown to increase, increase the likelihood of ADHD to decrease IQ and decrease cognitive reasoning abilities. And that does not cause the knee jerk reaction that purified recycled water does. I'm grateful that just a few weeks ago, EPA developed a new rule. And I think there was like a, I can't, I should have looked this up at a time I can't remember whether it's 2.6 million, I don't remember what, where the, how many zeros there are. But I think it's 2.6 billion dollars to, for some major communities to be able to finally once and for all get rid of the lead based pipes, because that is empirically demonstrated to be really, really detrimental to entire communities. And yet we don't have the kind of discussed knee jerk reaction about that. I think that is a really huge point. It really kind of is that our negativity bias? Is it what we have been already primed to feel more negatively about? Is it distance? You know, it's somebody else having lead pipes versus us drinking the purified water. You know, this is just opinion. I just feel like it's a body thing as opposed to a mineral thing. Lead just doesn't seem as icky as body related processes. That's, that's terrible. Like, I do remember, like this is, I lived in an older part of Hollywood for, for some of my LA time. And I do remember you turn on the faucet and you'd have to let it run until it stopped being brown. Who's the piping in the building or maybe in the neighborhood? It's the proper flaking. It's no big deal. Just a punch it, just a punch. I was gonna get a lot of, it's normal. Like a normal like first step. Like you were, you know, but the, and even in, even in the olden days of growing up in the town with the well water that you would think is, oh, so separate from all, because this is where it came from. It's like, yeah, our water tastes bad, but it comes from a well. So it's pure. It's not that wastewater treated stuff that everybody else is drinking. We got the better water, even though it tastes terrible. And then of course, years later, they did testing and found all kinds of benzines and things that like that aren't supposed to be drunk that were above the levels that you would want to be given fertilizer. All sorts of things that work its way into. Yeah. Pesticides. Oh, I grew up on wonderful water. Anytime. Yeah, farm water is by the way, farm water is amazing. That's making it glow in the dark. I probably do have never checked. I don't know. But I think, I think once people understand that ecosystem, knowing that a purified water is higher regulated, or even your drinking water is better treated and more free of contaminants than the water you would get from a bottle of water or, you know, my goodness, drinking from a lake or a river or anything like this, that it's actually a much cleaner version of water than what they've been accepted. And even if you go, if you were to go right now to like a a camping supply store or a hiking supply store and you get a water filter, those water filters are not regulated. So there, we get safer water out of the tap. And yet there's some suspicion about that. So my question for the future for education, I think, and the messaging is, you know, not everybody's going to be able to make it to these education centers. Not every treatment facility will have the funding to have these kinds of walkthroughs and educational outreach initiatives. So, you know, how do we message moving into the future when we would love people to have water that we're creating sustainably, that we are trying to develop new ways of living in areas where maybe there's not enough, you know, whatever it is. But, you know, how do you go against the marketing messaging that has billions of dollars from the big corporations versus, you know, it comes out of your tap and it's been tested and it's clean. So yeah. Good question. Good question. Did you have any other, you know, interesting insights from your study or just, you know, other questions that you're interested in looking into with your students? Well, we've kind of, like I said, I focus on the topic for a while and then I kind of go into a different topic. And so I have really, really loved this project and we may do a little bit of additional follow-up to it. But kind of gotten to a point where now I found some other topics in some other areas completely unrelated. So maybe in a couple of years I can come back and talk about something else too. In a totally different range. Awesome. Would you recommend that we refer to the recycled water, purified recycled water as toilet water? I would think that that would be a very, very inaccurate way to describe it. And in fact, you know, often it's referred to as toilet to tap and that phrase is so wrong because it's really like toilet to first processing, to ultra filtration, to et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, to finally. And they're trying to be transparent in the name, but at the same time it might also be undermining what they're trying to achieve. In some communities that phrase toilet to tap has actually not been used by the people who are behind the process, but instead people who are trying to shoot that process down. And so that because they're that phrase does kind of bring back the kind of yuck factor. And so that's a phrase that my understanding is the communities where there's been some controversy about implementing this, that phrase was kind of used in a almost antagonistic way to lower attitudes about it. Yeah, there was a comment in our chat here actually saying that in San Diego, they used the word the phrase toilet water and they were able to like stop an initiative actually using recycled water in this man. Exactly. Speaking from somebody who grew up in Farland, they don't grow your produce in honey. Like you gotta understand. Like all of this is connected. Yeah, I've been using the phrase toilet this evening and it's knowingly sensationalistic and you know, I assume the intelligence of my listeners in this conversation to know I use it in humor and not in seriousness. So now it's time for you to leave your arms. All of your is grown in poop. That's how we do it. That's what works. That's what makes it grow. So yeah, get educated, get over it. I want that t-shirt get educated. Don Hogan in the chat room is everything ever see what ends up in a hot water heater is that bad to drink? Yes, it's not ever recommended to drink your hot water because your hot water heaters typically most hot water systems do gain a lot of contaminants and roll kind of build-ups over years. And did you ever know there could be extremophiles in there? We don't know. You don't know. But you are supposed to drink it if the water supply has been shut down due to a major earthquake or some other catastrophe, then it can be a source. Then go ahead. It's worth it. But yeah, it's typically you're not supposed to drink that. So don't use hot water and then boil water to like preheat it or anything like that. Only drink the cold water because it's not gone through that extra potentially contaminated stuff. Steve, do you have anything else you want to add about this study or any other work that you're currently interested in that you want to comment on? That kind of broad open-ended question is kind of a paralyzing question to me. I do that to people. Deer in headlights. Yeah, but I have moved on to especially currently working on some questions that some students and I were curious about during my human sexuality class. And so yeah, in a couple years, maybe I can come back and tell you about some cool things we've been finding out there. What was the question? What's the question at least? Leave us hanging. So one of the things that some of the students and I were talking about last time I taught this class was the recognition that a lot the majority of people, and by that I just mean at least more than 50% of people, engage in porn use at least on an occasional basis. And at the same time, the majority of people again, more than 50%, at least have some objection to pornography. So if you think about that Venn diagram, there are a lot of people who are engaging in a behavior that is causing them distress because of some incompatibility with their values, with their value systems. And so we're beginning the process of kind of looking at what are the kinds of oppositions that people have about pornography. And especially with kind of an eye toward, I'm not a big fan of the big industry, the porn addiction industry, which makes a lot of money without much promise for actually helping people because the method that's used is not going to help someone who's engaging in a value discrepant behavior. And so we're starting to look at, you know, is a person's opposition due to like, exploitation of people, or is a person's opposition due to any kind of religious belief or is a person's opposition due to unrealistic expectations that they may have. So there's multiple reasons why a person may have some opposition. And so if a person's wanting to address a value discrepant behavior, maybe instead of treating everyone in a cookie cutter way as though everyone has the same basis of their opposition, maybe we need to start looking into where the opposition is for each individual person. If they're engaging in something that they want to reduce, how can we help them reduce that behavior? No, that's, that's just, we're just- Reduce the meaning here if it's disturbing or in conflict, right? Exactly. Yeah, if so, where is the discrepancy coming from and what is the cognitive distance that a person's going through and how do we understand that? Because I think that that kind of approach might be better than just the ineffectual approach that is often used in the porn addiction industry. So when from studies about hiding autism, masking autism symptoms to studies about water purification to porn, I kind of all over the place. But that's what I love about my job. Yeah, but also the bottom line here is that you're bringing your students into this inquiry process and so you're giving space for the next generation of scientists, also for scientific training, the thought process to take place so that, you know, and that you're helping them focus these questions and these projects and actually create and find, answer some questions hopefully or get some relevant information. That's really cool. Yeah, that's why I love working at a place like this where I can do that. Super cool. I was like, wait, you can do that in science? I thought you had to be super focused. Hold on. All right, so we have a few more stories to go. Do you want to hang out and talk about them or you can add? I'd love to if you don't mind some blank slate questions of, you know, complete ignorance going into the topics. I love it. Perfect. That's how I approach everything in life. Thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Rouse. This is This Week in Science. If you are loving the show, even if you're not, I don't know, head over to twist.org, click on our Zazzle link. You can find our merchandise there, hats, pens, they don't know if we have pens. Maybe you can find a pen, twists. Do we have pens? I don't know. We have mouse pads and hats and all sorts of things. I don't know why I said pens. We might. Now we have to make them. Now I have to make a pen. But if you would like to help support the show, Zazzle is a great way to find bits of twists that you can carry around with you throughout your day. All right, come on back, Justin. That's a good pen. It's a great pen. It's your turn, Justin. Oh, let's talk about the doulas. This is a... All right, I want to talk about doulas. Yeah, so this research was following up. Basically, doulas are not what do you call it, medical advisors. Well, they're not, yeah, they don't do medical care. Doulas are something that... Irregenced ones have experience with stuff, but yeah, they haven't been trained in medicine. Yeah. Not necessarily, but they are not like a midwife, which is going to be a degree and they're going to be involved in delivering the child and giving you medical advice and doing the evaluations along the way. A doula is somebody who's basically there to inform, to educate, and to advise mothers who are expecting. They can also be in an advocacy role so that when, say, a mother has come up with a birth plan, say, that plan is to have a natural birth and to avoid a C-section, the doulas' role is to also advocate for that patient when the doctor is deciding, well, it'd be easier to do a C-section as an example. And saying, well, our patient has requested this and only wants that option as a last resort if it's an emergency situation. So there's advocacy, there's education, they will do the sort of, not the ultrasounds, but the one where you're just listening for the heartbeat kind of a thing. So this is actually, the study was intriguing to me because when my, we were assigned a doula in my small farming town back in 2002, 2003 when my first child was born. So this thing, it was sounding me that this has only become something that was included with Medicaid in 2020. It sort of was expanded and it's very, it's still not in every state, it's not everywhere where this is available, but it was the, in 2020 the Surgeon General recommended coverage for doula services to expand access to quality maternal care followed by a 2022 White House initiative to address these disparities by allowing doulas to be covered under Medicaid. Depending on your insurance companies and everything else, you may or may not have ever encountered or heard of this, but they looked at, I guess a million live births in these nine states, narrowed it down to 722 pregnancies with doula and 722 without, this was propensity score matching so that there was controls on age and race and socio-economic status. And they found that with the doula, cesarean deliveries were 47% less likely. Also very interestingly, there was a 29% lower risk of preterm birth and then into that sort of how knowledge adapts people's perception, they found that people who had had a doula were 46% more likely to attend postpartum checkups, compared to which is the one that actually found kind of actually more intriguing, like the reduced cesareans totally makes sense because it is already considered something that American medical has more cesareans than the rest of the world. We have things to do, we got to schedule it, chop chop. It's efficient for the doctor, but it can have ramifications on future deliveries as a potential. So it's in a, which was another element that they found that this was also by preventing cesareans that you could be creating future fertility functionality. But that post, that much higher postpartum checkup, to me said they now understand the process and trust the process and know why they're going to the postpartum checkups because there's a value that they have now built for why they're going where the group that didn't have a doula explaining and educating about this maybe once in a lifetime process that these mothers are going through, now they're informed and know why they want to re-engage with these checkups. Or how, not just why, but how. How and why. There is, very often there is just a, for many women, they have no idea what they're doing, what's going on. And it's not just, it's being lost inside of being lost. And I wonder, does the doula relationship last beyond the birth? Is the doula still there after? Is the doula only there as that transition, that person that is between the hospital and the mother, the family? What is the relationship that's involved here? Was there a difference at any point with any part of the populations they were looking at? Yeah, actually there was a slight, let me go find it here, but I got it. There was, yeah okay, so in counties with high infant mortality rates, caesarean deliveries dropped by 57% with the women with doula support. So it was actually another 11% higher, 10% higher in those sort of underserved communities. So the effect was bigger there, right? There was a lack of significant fighting regarding emergency department visits, inpatient admission, postpartum depression or anxiety. These were not affected, meaning, yeah, the doula didn't solve all the problems, but it didn't contribute to them either, right? So it was, it didn't, basically it didn't have any negatives and had all these positives associated with it. And this, in this study you can kind of look at, so there have been previous studies that indicated that this should be the trend and is the trend elsewhere. But this one was post expansion in Medicaid. And basically then you can kind of look at it like this is the follow-up, how did our expansion work? What is the result? And so what it shows is extremely positive. Therefore it would be very likely that this will get expanded further. I don't know, it doesn't explain whether the doulas are doing the follow-up or if it's at the hospital. So I don't know if it was normal. Normal channels, if there's extra communication after the fact. But I could see if in the group that had, I guess, 46% lower follow-up after, I could see that it, maybe if they didn't understand the benefit of going to visit their practitioner afterwards, then they, if they didn't understand why they would need to go, like, I'm fine, kids, whatever. Then maybe they, that's why they weren't going. But it could be that they have to go there versus maybe the doula was visiting at home. So those are also, maybe there's a convenience factor involved, but it doesn't, it didn't pull those details out of the study. I'm just speculating there, which way it might have played out. Yeah. I'm wondering also, oh, go ahead, Steve. Oh, that's just really exciting, especially to find out about the extra information that getting information begets the desire to get more information and getting learning makes you realize the value and continue to seek out learning. But I think it's the doula here is human, right? This is a person who's interacting with you personally who's like, you know, how's it going? You know, have you made this appointment? Did you do that? And this is your next step. And this is what you should expect and just kind of leading you through the process, right? And like Justin said, also an advocate for you. And I recently read some news about Kaiser Permanente starting to do away with a lot of like, it's in-person hospital tours for like the birthing rooms and the birth wing, you know, so and they're doing, they're getting rid of in-person classes in a lot of places so that in favor of, you know, online recordings. So you sit and you watch, you know, an asynchronous tour of the hospital and asynchronous lecture or explanation of stuff that's going on. And that is, that is, the tours are nice. The tours are nice because like, you know, there's some people meeting in the space and seeing people and walking through, right? Going to be an emergency mode when the day comes. Right. You're going to be in like urgent freak out mode trying to keep cool because you're not the one giving birth. It's like, you know, rainbows and marshmallows. But knowing like, we park here, we walk here, take a left, and then it's going to be down the hall and to the right or like knowing exactly where your footsteps will be on that day is exceedingly important. Absolutely. Can definitely think about my own personal experience of just the ignorance just brings about all these panic thoughts about what could possibly go wrong. And actually, we were able to go through a tour and we're able to see, okay, yeah, we can do this and even seeing people in the process and think, okay, they're doing it, we can do it. This is good. So that, that is a shame. That's too bad. And it, but it just makes me wonder. Yeah, but it makes me wonder, it's interesting to see how the expansion of this within Medicaid has been beneficial, beneficial. But then to see, and this is not Medicaid, obviously, but another insurance provider reducing the in-person, you know, touch that, you know, is so which I for this, I don't know, personal health, medical health, but there's something about birth and motherhood that having, and even just as a family, husband, wife, partners, whatever, you know, going in and having people talk to you and reassure you and to have it depersonalized. I understand money, time, etc. But at the same time, it's a question how it's the real impacts it's going to have. Yeah. So one of the, one of the things that I think influences why doulas are so important is just what you're saying. They're paid a tremendously lower salary than your PhD OBGYN, meaning that they will be able to spend a lot more time with the patients than they may spend with the OBGYN. Right. And the patient can't just call up the OBGYN all the time. You call and they're like, excuse me, I be on hold or we're gonna find, you know, we'll find somebody else to answer your question or yeah. So there is an economic driver that should be recognized in this that you will get a lot more education in this doula system than you ever will and getting those quick meetings where they're gonna check this, check that, check this out the door kind of a scenario. Yeah. With the human touch education with the human touch. Yeah. Want to move to your next one? Oh, what was the next one? Where did I got to say that? Is like, if I pulled up a whole bunch of other extras in case, oh, this one, this one is real quick. What was I going to do? I wrote it down. Yeah, I can, this is the global warming silver lining. I don't know how much. Well, here it is. Because one of the things we've all been most concerned about when it comes to global warming is how will it affect coffee production? Like, that's the leading thing on everybody's mind. This is like the biggest concern. And I think the concern is, is, is maybe underrated. Especially for you as a host of this week in science in Denmark at 5am. Yeah. So, so this is just real quick. This is a, a, a, a plus study. It says under climate change scenarios, 30 to 44% of 30 to 30, sorry, 30 to 44% more land in Ethiopia may become suitable for growing Arabica coffee by 2080. Now, Ethiopia is, I think the only, I think that's where coffee was, maybe the only other coffee, I don't know. But this is, this is one of the major producers of coffee worldwide. It is more than a quarter of Ethiopia's income. Currently, it is the largest growing industry of coffee anywhere in terms of more and more land. But then know that they're going to get up to 44% more land that will be suitable for growing coffee under global warming conditions under two different models that were the scenarios that were run. Is at least some good news. I mean, these, there are these questions, right? How is the water going to be redistributed as climate changes? We can't make predictions of, we're starting to make very specific predictions. Apparently, New Mexico, Santa Fe, New Mexico area is, or Arizona is going to have more water. I don't know, but I don't know whether that means more floods or whether that means more nice running rivers in an area that is now very dry. It'll likely be both. Like this is not aerial river. What is it called? Atmospheric river. Yes. We're supposed to have one of those this weekend in Portland. We'll move from Portland, maybe down into Central California or places east, and dump tremendous amounts of water sometimes, and then nothing for a few years after. And it means it's more stochastic, unreliable, at least unreliable in the sense that it's not the pattern that we are accustomed to in a hundred years of, you know, last hundred years of American climate. Which is just already like a very subjective starting point, deciding that this is how things always will be. The question here with Ethiopia though is, okay, South America, are you going to have what's going to happen to your environmental conditions for coffee and chocolate and things, and should you move your arms to Ethiopia? What it's also showing is that things will move. As there's 44% more land available in Ethiopia, there might be 20% less somewhere else. Or like in South America, this is again, this is misremembering the information, is that it wasn't so much, I think, that the coffee growing overall areas were going to be reduced or increased, but that they would be moving. And so then you have a scenario of like, okay, like it's like if Central California, they're like, okay, Central California is no longer good at growing tomatoes. We have to move all of that to Nevada. That's not a thing that you just do overnight. That is a tremendous shift of industries, of infrastructure. So, you know, even when we were talking about how much areas will be affected, sometimes we're not describing that those areas will not be in the same places. Because this article is specific to Ethiopia. And so yeah, that's the question that came to my mind first of, okay, well, what about other places? Is this gain at the loss elsewhere? And what is the balance of losses and gains? And I think that's important for us to look not just at individual countries, but to look more systemically at the entire, the world ecosystem. Yeah, that is the point. I'm really looking at it. Did you have more to say about the coffee, Justin? Did you have a quick blurb at the end of their show there? Because yeah, it was just like, good, I usually bring terrible news when it comes to global warming. I look for the good news. I'm like, oh, this looks like a good story. I'll bring this one. And then by the end of it, it slips. And I was like, oh, wait, I thought this was a good story. No, you didn't. You knew the whole time. All right, well, let me move on to my last couple of stories as we finish up the show here. Social media, some of us spend more and more time on different social media. Now that it's become more and more fragmented, some of us are still on X, others have moved to threads. There's the mastodon federated servers, blue sky, I'm on there. There's a butterfly. I followed the butterfly. There's so many different social media platforms. And researchers just published in iScience, so it is openly accessible to anyone. Their study of the X former Twitter platform, but it wasn't really because they couldn't get the data anymore because the API has been shut down to researchers since it was purchased and is under new ownership. So the researchers simulated a social media platform that might be like X, which is formerly Twitter in their research. So this is a simulation of something that might happen in the real world. And so the whole thing is like, is this really very relevant or verifiable? Anyway, the question is, since X and other platforms have verified users, verification on some platforms is simply show us who you are and we'll say that you're a real person. And then it doesn't mean anything, it just means that you are then verified as a human being and as who you say you are. The new X platform is using verification as a pay for play. So if you pay for a subscription fee, you are verified. And the algorithm has been suggested to prioritize those paid verified users over others. And the question is, do these verified users then have an outsized influence on what's going on and what people are thinking on the website, on the platform? So the researchers were like, well, we can't get the data, so let's simulate it. And so they put together their computer simulation where they used verified individuals, verified individuals with very extreme biased positions that were very firm and unflexible. And then individuals who were verified, who were more likely to shift their views and listen to other people's, have conversations with people. And what they determined is that verified users using what the assumed model for the algorithm in the X platform is, that verified users, yes, indeed, do influence the views and the ideas that take hold on the social media platform. And those users become more influential when they're less likely to talk to people. And people are more likely to start to just accept what those people say, as opposed to, you know, have conversations and share information. So the theory is that when you have verified individuals who can reach more people and can significantly impact idea formation, that that can reinforce echo chambers, which can have then ripple effects into not just that media platform, but also into other media outlets and also society in general. So the question is, you know, what do you do about this moving forward? And we don't know what to do, but they plan to increase the realism of their model. They want to add new speeds and reposting, and they're going to incorporate data from other platforms that actually have more open APIs like Blue Sky. So the concern is that you have media moguls or biased individuals with money who are paying for accounts, maybe even paid bot accounts, and pushing information in very biased ways that can have very negative influences. You know, but maybe I'm a good person and I have lots of money and I have a really good bot network. What do we think about this? Are we still doing social media, everyone? I'm not. I stopped a long time ago, and it was, there was a point in the early days of the Twitter where the only people on Twitter were interested in engaged in the subject that they were discussing. And at some point, the troll factory broke in and just started smashing conversation everywhere possible. And, you know, oh, I love the idea of open democratic conversation. But I think there should be an internal ethic of, I have something to contribute to this in a constructive way before an individual engages in the open form of discussion. And I don't see that anywhere in there. What I see instead is just a horrible banter and it's like not worth my time because I'm not getting anything out of it and I'm not communicating anything of value or learning anything of value from a lot of the conversations that go on. So for that reason, I basically stopped even looking at the social media. But it has been, it is still a place where a lot of people spend their time and influences a lot of our society at this instant. And that's what I'm speaking specifically about the Twitter. There's other ones that I will, I still don't like do postings or... Show your baby pictures, I know. But yeah, you know, you go, it is like, the worst thing is you get a phone call with somebody who you really would love to get an update from, but you don't have like a half an hour for the hundred distant friends of your past to all have half hour conversations to catch up once a very few... Oh, look, they have a new job. They've got a new kid. So this is a cost-benefit analysis, right? So what is it for you as an individual? And I think each of us is doing that. But, you know, I don't know, I worry about our kids. I worry about our society in general. So if I missed it in the description of the study, please forgive me. But did they communicate to the participants what the verification represented? Because you're right, is the verification just, I've paid money and therefore I'm allowed to have this this designation or is it some kind of recognition of being a real person in this particular study? Did they educate that? Because I do feel like that's part of internet and social media literacy for people to be able to find out what exactly does this verification mean, that it doesn't necessarily mean you're an expert on a topic. It means you paid money or it means you are real. So did they at all communicate to the participants what that verification represented? No, this was just, yeah, they just had, you know, these very fake verification. So it's kind of like the real world. Yeah, and they were just looking to see how different numbers of the verified users impacted the formation of ideas or of little echo chambers within the total. So yeah, that was part of it. This is an extension of a philosophy that has been, oh my gosh, now I forgot what the decision was by the Supreme Court. But that there's a philosophy that has been endorsed by the Supreme Court, which has allowed dark money to flow into politics, which basically states that money is free speech. And by incorporating that into a public forum type look, something that appears like a public forum, but is not having people who pay into that system get more weighted speech is absolutely in keeping with that philosophy. So I mean, to me, it's unsurprising that the algorithms are preferencing people who pay coming from a company. Unfortunate. Citizens United. Thank you, David. Thank you so much. Oh my gosh. And that's why that, and when always escapes me is because it's such double speak. But when we come down to it, such double speak terminology, Citizens United for corporations over citizen speech is basically what they should have called it. But of course, they called it Citizens United. So it sounded friendly. That you want to talk about toilet water. That's what toilet water is. That's toilet water. There we go. Yes. Yeah, but I think that the point that Steve got out is the education aspect. And I think a lot of people don't understand how the platforms work that they're using, they don't understand the algorithms that are influencing what they see and, you know, different topics they see different users they see. I think I think education on that front would go a long way, you know, to help pop these echo chamber bubbles. But yeah, it's difficult though, because the systems change so frequently. And so it's hard to have an education system with a constantly dynamically shifting topic that we need to make people literate about. And so how do you how do you enhance literacy when you've got an ever shifting topic ever shifting goalpost? That's hard. And I think this is a good segue into my into another story here, which is, you know, you just teach people the best negative bias. You know, one lesson, this is it, you know, we could we could have taught people not to like social media, but we didn't do that. We didn't know the dangers. However, art of generative artificial AI or large language models. Let's just teach people not to like them people already starting out, not too keen on them. So let's just keep going this way, everyone. New study just just published using chat GPT and stories written using the most recent version of chat GPT. This is published in Journal of Communication. Researchers put two different versions of the same stories, one written by a person and the other by chat GPT. And then participants judged how much they liked the stories. However, did they flip? Did they flip it on them? Did they trick the people? No, so they just like they just said how much do you like the stories and generally, people liked the stories written by humans better. But the chat GP stories were a close second. They weren't as far off as you would expect. They just didn't laugh. They lacked like the depth. It was as if they were written at a more basic level. They lacked some of that the detail and whatever it is that human factor that gets into a storytelling. But it was close. But it was close. But when they asked the participants to judge the stories and they told them this is written by a person or this is written by chat GPT, chat GP was, GTP was terrible. People did not like those stories at all. They loved the stories written by people. They were superior. So what's interesting, I think, about this is- Did they flip it on the, because maybe this is the same study and I just misunderstood it because I didn't bring it for the show. I didn't totally prior to it. But it sounded like it was the stories written by humans, if the participants were told that they were written by chat GPT, that they didn't like them. Absolutely. Yeah. So okay, so they did. Okay, so it was their bias decided whether or not they liked it, not the material itself. That's exactly it. But that was why they did that. But because they saw in the first instant experiment that they were very close. They weren't that far off. And so the question was if people knew, would it be different? Or if they were told- I don't know if it was- Would it be different? And I don't know if it was chat GPT. It's the only one I know the name of. Otherwise, I've ignored. I've just at this point, not been forced to learn the names of any other large language model thing that I have to keep in mind. So it's just branded now. But what I'm interested here in is our human biases that are already- Yeah, I'll just say yes before I get to it. Yes. Are human biases? Yes. Yes. So we know that in hiring in the sciences that or even in ranking for NSF grants, that if gender or race are involved, there are differences in the ways that the applications or the proposals are ranked by the people doing the assessing. When you get rid of those identifying factors, those differences very often go away. Not always, but they're more likely to go away. So there has been shown time and again that when we know who we're assessing, we are already biased in a particular way. And this is just another example of that. But the extremity of it, I think is interesting and I wonder if it will hold. And I want- Where is it coming from now? And- Yeah. Is it fear? Of course. Yeah. You know, there's an interesting thing that AI is doing with the music industry right now. Oh, don't go in there. Pretty incredible, which is it can take the voice of one artist and have them sing the lyrics of something else. There's some pretty fascinating mashups that now exist. And there's a huge outcry that this is ruining the future of music. But this is- We've been through this so many times. We had, oh, what is this synthesized music? You mean you won't have an artist playing all of the instruments? That will ruin music. What do you mean it can be recorded and shared? That will ruin music. What do you mean it will be like, you know, video killed radio and the synthesizing synthesized digital music killed live performances. Like all of these things are going to- are happening regardless of how much anybody wants to pump the brakes on it. Yeah. Do I want- Do I want AI music? No. I want to hear an artist that I can feel like, you know, I've developed a relationship with them and their music over many years and enjoy what they create. I want to read stories from a person. I want to, you know, there are certain aspects to the creation, artistic creative, creation of things that I, as an individual, I think many other people would like to continue consuming from people. But that's not to say that these generative and other tools that are artificial intelligence quote unquote, which we have said many times before, they're not intelligent. But that they're good tools and we can use them as tools. But yeah, I don't know. Would you- How do you think Steve, how do your students feel about the AI stuff going on? So I've got a colleague who has done some really, really amazing work trying to educate her students about the limitations of chat GPT. And so she's done a project where she has has them generate a term paper, a very brief term paper using chat GPT, and then go into that and look at what is accurate and what is not accurate. And even color code, green, this is good, yellow, red, no, these aren't even real sources that are being cited. And she's done a great job of being able to show that the students emerge from that experience a lot more skeptical, a lot more cautious about even using chat GPT for their own work. Upper level students start out more skeptical than the beginning level students do. But the realization of actually being able to see and evaluate a paper on a topic you know well helps a person kind of come to a realization that, yeah, this is not, it may sound good. The language itself may roll well and the chat GPT can come up with phrases that really communicate well, but yeah, it's not there yet. So it's not, it's not- They're not going to take my podcast yet. So I totally agree, like the chat GPT cannot write. And when you're asking it to generate, you're asking it to make it up. Like there have been lawyers who have cited cases that didn't exist because they asked for a legal to generate a legal brief with references to case law. And it did because it's going to do what you ask even though those case laws didn't exist. Yeah, it's not going to say I can't do that. Right. But what it- Sometimes it does and then if you needle it, it'll goes, oh, okay, yeah, well, I guess I can do that and it continues. But what I found it actually is really good at is analyzing a text that you have offered it. So I do this, I use this as a- I don't know if I'm supposed to say this. I use this as a tool, sometimes when I'm writing up on a scientific research paper. I might have a 40 page paper that has four legs and is in getting deep into method technique and things that I'm maybe not familiar. If I put it in that whole, if I put the study into chat GPT, I can ask questions about the study. What is the cohort size? What were the- what were the implicate- you know, where does it reference how the groups were separated? And I found it to be highly accurate if you give it a specific text to work off of. If you're asking it to go outside of a already set text, it has all kinds of- yeah, gosh knows where it's pulling information for. But if you limit it to- hallucination, they call it hallucin- because it interpolates, it's a predictor, right? It's probably- but if you limit it to analyzing a text that you have provided it, it's actually really good at breaking down that information. So there's going to be- there's going to be uses for it that I think people may have not tapped quite yet, which is that it's not going to generate a story or tell a tale or give you a legal brief or do your work for you. But it can assist in analysis. And I found it to, you know- it will do those things just not- I've found it to be highly accurate. Also, if you ask it to double check, it will. And sometimes it's like, I'll go, oh, oops, actually. So you even- even though it's good at analysis, you have to find that in the- an original study to verify because it can make mistakes. It's not perfect. But when you're dealing with a large volume of text, it's actually really good at being used as a tool of inquiry. You can ask questions about the study and you can tell you whether that was covered, where it wasn't covered, or what the closest thing was and where it references it. So- but don't let it- don't let it write for you because it just can't. It just doesn't get it. All right. I am going to move us to my nighttime nightmare fuel for us. Underwater walking honey badger. Wow. Mad robotics out of Poland has a four-legged dog-like robot that they- it normally doesn't go underwater, but they- they put it underwater and this is the sound of a robot underwater at the bottom of a pool. This is- you will not hear draws anymore. This is the sound you should be aware of. They used to say, worry about the, you know, robots until you can throw them in the pool. Now you can't throw them in the pool anymore. I have robots in my ear. Ooh, I didn't hit stop on the YouTube screen. Sorry, it was yelling. Mark Rober was yelling in my ear. But these mad robotics quadrupeds are currently being used hopefully for underground activities, for mining, for emergency situations, and maybe now for underwater work as well. I will never forget the sound of these robots. Yeah, I used to always think if the- if a robot uprising happened, you'd just hop on a boat somewhere, but no, no, thank you. No, robot, that's what I'm here for. Steve, thank you so much for joining us on the show tonight. It's so fun that you- you stayed and that you're still here. I love it. Yeah, thanks for- thanks for letting me join you. Yeah, it was a fun combo, for sure. Yeah, I really enjoyed it. Thank you. And everybody out there, thank you so much for joining us, Justin.

Just put twists in the subject line so it doesn't get spam filtered into the bottom of the ocean with one of those four-legged robots. I will never be near that. We look forward to discussing all great things about science again with you next week if you've learned anything from this show. Remember, it's all in your head. Uh-oh, you might have to dance. This Week in Science. This Week in Science. This Week in Science. This Week in Science. This Week in Science. It's the end of the world, so I'm setting up a shop, got my banner unfurled. It says the scientist is in. I'm gonna sell my advice. Show them how to stop the robot with a simple device. I'll reverse global warming with a wave of my hand. And all it'll cost you is a couple of grand. This Week in Science is coming your way. So everybody listen to what I say. I use the scientific method for all that is worth. And I'll broadcast my opinion all over the earth. Cause it's This Week in Science. This Week in Science. This Week in Science. Science. Science. This Week in Science. This Week in Science. This Week in Science. Science. Science. Science. And we're back with the Twists After Show. After Hours. And it's already after after hours. It's after after after hours. It is now past 7 AM, since your European time. It's still completely dark outside. I think that we've shifted. It's shifted into those. Sorry, I've shifted into those. Those darkness hours. At some point there's going to be light from around 10 AM until 3 PM. That's not what we had. Let's see, what are they saying? That's not Central European type. That's far north I guess. It's being in Denmark. Not the... Do you feel that at all where you're at? The effect of the sunlight change? I went to grad school in Minnesota and, like I said, I grew up in Denver, but then I spent time in Texas and then up to Minnesota. And I could really, really feel the reality of it during the winter of the lack of sunlight. Are you getting any of that? Yeah, because I think Denmark might be about as far north as Calgary or something like that. Maybe even a little further north than that. So, yeah. Like, working indoors, you go to work in the dark. And then when you get off of work, it's dark. And you wonder, has the sun just gone away? Because you just won't encounter it in a day. It's really wild. Now, the converse though is also interesting. Because the converse is in the peak summer kind of times. You will have sunlight till 11 o'clock at night. And then the sun will be showing up at 4 o'clock in the morning. And then, you'll be around. It gets dark and you're like, oh, what is that? Oh, people live in darkness. How do you do that? How do you function? How do you go out in late in the evening and still see everything? Yeah, when my kids were young, my spouse and I were so glad that we were living in Southern California and not one of those areas. Because it's so easy to just tell the kids, okay, it's time to go to bed. It's dark. They can accept that. But if it doesn't get dark until 1130, no, no, that's a problem. So, yes. So then you need like blackout curtains. Right. And a whole... I think I had to improvise in the beginning with... And this worked amazingly well. A spray, water spray bottle on the window and then putting aluminum foil. And it just sticks. It's just, you know, and blocked out the windows until I could go and pick up blackout curtains, which is the thing I didn't really realize that I needed. But yeah. The best blackout curtains in the world are in the Northern countries. But yeah, but then, you know, and then you get to winter and you don't have any use for them at all. So it's... But then it's all electricity or I guess whale fat. So actually... So I'm laughing at that. I mean solar energy, right? We're using solar a lot in California. No, I'm laughing at that. For power, but then you need batteries. What are you gonna get? You need to power the Christmas lights somehow. Come on. I literally just laughed at that. But that is... That is when I was in Greenland for six weeks. I was kind of joking, kind of not. No, I was in Greenland for six weeks. That's how the cabin I was in was heated. It was a narwhal blower that was being used as the heating source. Yeah. Not as convenient as all the water pipes underneath the city of Reykjavik. That's for sure. Oh, and then I've told this story before, but there was no piping in this little Greenland village. There was a bucket and I got there with a bunch of researchers. It was like nine or 10 of us sharing this one cabin and they were gonna go off and do this for the expedition. We all got there and I was like, oh, I was like, there's a toilet. And then I realized, oh, it's just with a bucket under. And it was, we had been there nine, 10 of us for I think three days. And the whole time I'm like, what do they do with this bucket? Because they're like, oh, there's a crew that comes by and takes care of the bucket. But I'm like, how do they clean the bucket? Like, where is their water source for that? And like, how did they, like, that seems like a really intense job. Turns out, unbeknownst to anybody that was there, there are these sort of rubber durable bags that are supposed to be put into the bucket. Oh, no. So the crew when they came was rather upset. Yeah. Yeah. They sort of just taken the bag. Didn't put together that you obviously need a liner for the bucket for them to transport it away. Oh, like here's a room full of PhDs. Horribly mortified by the fact that they hadn't put together that this makes no sense. It's just magically going to take care of itself. Yeah. I was like, I thought like, yeah, it's going to win. I like, we were like all like, can't wait to see how they handle this. Do they just take the, put a new bucket? Are they going to bring a fresh bucket and then take that one away and it goes somewhere and gets cleaned and where do they clean it? Because they're like, where's, And hence was your learned the usefulness of informational visuals. Bucket. This is a lack of knowledge. Very quickly. Yeah. Eric Knapp in the chat room beaten by a honey bucket. Oh my goodness. Let's see. Yeah. I'm excited about our inner, our conversation next week. Talking about humanizing humanization across divides as opposed to dehumanization, which has led to so much. Yeah. Stripe and division. Yeah. So I'm excited about next week also. What else do you have going on, Steve? Um, yeah, we're just here hanging out now. I'm here hanging out, but we're, um, yeah, this time of the year, we're getting term papers and things like that. So like lots of exciting grading going to be happening over the next little bit. Okay. Now that's exciting. I'm excited about grading. I'd be great. I do think it's exciting. You do think it's exciting? I do. Yeah. You do. Okay. You don't have an army of teaching assistants that. Yeah. No, no, we've even got a policy here that, um, TAs can be used for big classes, but even then it can only be for like grading things that are objectively scored. And so like I've got colleagues who teach large, I mean, or teach a stats class and a stats class, you know, you can objectively score whether or not the formulas were calculated, but, um, like I've got going to be having some term papers coming in in the next little bit. And we wouldn't want to be having TAs grading those. And, um, so, yeah, but that's actually something that I really enjoy being a part of the process of helping people learn how to write and, um, and, you know, walking them through that process to become stronger writers. Yeah. Kind of fantastic. One thing that we didn't talk about with your, uh, with your work is, uh, your interest in open science. I think, you know, and we've talked about before, you know, like the, uh, the replication project to try and replicate a whole bunch of psychology research to, you know, make sure it's, you know, whether or not it was good and, um, yeah. How did you get involved in that? I was, I've got a, I've got a, a number in my head that's probably pulled from nowhere that like 60 something percent of the fundamental, uh, research that underpins psychology, uh, has not been replicatable. It's like, it's like, I don't know if it's that big, but I know that there's a lot of it that hasn't necessarily seen, uh, rigorous replication. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, yeah, and I have run into that myself. It's, um, I, I used to teach the intro to side class. I don't teach that right now. And so many of the most fun stories to tell and most fun studies to talk about, I now can't talk about the last time I taught, I was like, I don't know that I can believe this study. Like there's, there's one really cool study that, um, made the argument that like if you, um, if you have people watch a film holding a hand in their key, they're using a lot of the same muscles that they use to smile and they'll rate it as more funny. But if you hold it in your mouth in a way that's using some of the frowning muscles, though, they'll re rate the same video clip less enjoyably. And so sad to know that that study doesn't replicate because that's a fun one to talk about. And, um, so yeah, that, psych has really been hit hard, especially my end of psychology really is the personality slash social psychology. And that's where some of the biggest, um, scandals came out in that branch of the psychology or sub branch of psychology. Um, but I'm, I'm a, the, I'm the editor of, um, the journal of psych, the psych journal of psychological research, psych is the honor society of psychology. And, uh, so I'm the journal editor for that. And I was really, really glad that, um, under the previous editor, the, uh, psych high board of directors was willing to go the distance of, of adding badges where we could, um, honor the studies that are doing it right, you know, that either do pre registration or provide open materials, because that's, that's what we need to be moving toward. So registration is extremely important because you declared, I'm going to look at this and then you publish the results on it versus we ran 30 versions of this study. Here's the one we like. Exactly. That's the only thing that the public sees if it's not registered, right? Because when, when a study is evaluated with, when we're looking for, um, statistical significance, we're basically with the standard cutoff level, accepting a one in 20 chance of getting data that are not accurate, actually accurate. Um, so if we run 20 studies, it's very likely that one of them may become statistically significant, even if there's no effect there. And so if I just continue to torture the data until I find something statistically significant, I might, I might end up with an article. Torture the data. Key hacking. Yeah, yeah. It's, it's a real thing. It's, and, and I, I've got to even acknowledge that my own process of research has become stronger because there were times when it was like, well, try a different type of analysis or maybe double the sample size and let's see what happens. And now we're reminding ourselves, no, that's not what we teach our students in research methodology classes. We shouldn't be doing that either. And I think that's a, a good evolution for psychology to be really buying into all these open science methods and replication stuff. Yeah. I went to, um, an open science, uh, like the, what are they, the, there's a, a society for open science or something like that. Center for open science and yes, the center for open science. And they just had a meeting like a couple of weeks ago and it was interesting to sit in on it and hear, uh, you know, what people were saying about the platforms and the methodologies. And, you know, it seems like it's, it's a lot, you know, there's a lot of infrastructure that's being built to support it right now. Um, and I, I guess I, with you know, all of the just normal methodologies of, you know, what stats programs and how you're going to, you know, do everything like, how realistic is it? Do you think that this is going to grow and really do you, do you think, do you, are you optimistic that it's going to be something that really influences science that it's going to be picked up by a large part of the community? I'm, I'm optimistic, especially if I, as I've watched what's happened in the discussion, even like in like the, the newsletters and, um, magazines of the association for psychological science and the American Psych Association, when this movement first started, a lot of people were really resistant about preregistration and open data and open materials thinking, oh, it's going to squelch science. It's going to, it's going to prevent us from having this ability to just go out and discover if we have to preregister everything. And I saw a lot of hesitation when that movement first started, but now people are accepting that no, it doesn't have to. It's just take an extra step and, um, just make it public. What are you really wanting to find out? You know, we all have to go through the process of getting our studies approved by an ethics board. It doesn't take too much extra work to also then put in a publicly accessible place ahead of time. I'm going to gather data from this many subjects. I'm going to run these analyses. I'm hoping to find out this. Yeah, that's just a best practice and I see more and more acceptance of it. Yeah. I'm just thinking of like animal studies and, uh, you know, human, like there's the, the ethics board, but then also if you're going and getting animals out of the wild, you have to list how many animals you want and all this kind of stuff. So there's, there's all sorts of places where you already have this information kind of planned out. So, um, yeah, it wouldn't be actually thinking as you're explaining it, it wouldn't be a big step and then you've got it all. And so for publication, it's like, we've already got it there. So maybe it's a whole process easier. It almost a red flag at some point, especially if it's, especially if it's any kind of a health claim where there is a thing you could take that would fix it, whatever that may be. You don't get to see anything. And there's no, well, you can see the data, but there's not a pre-registration. It means you got a version of a study. That's the red flag. That's the assumption I make is you got the version that made that connection and you have no idea how many three, four, 50 times they ran versions of that study where they didn't find that connection. And that's, that's the thing that, uh, that's where, where I get like, I don't see it. I don't see that they, they, they, they said in advance that they were going to do this study and hold themselves accountable to that result. The one thing I would love to have seen, I always talk about this and I wish I had the wherewithal, the finance, if I was a multi-bazillionaire or just a good community organizer, I would love to see a journal of no result. Yes. Yes. Here's a, here's a, an entire journal dedicated to failed replication studies. Isn't there one? It's not popular, but there is one. Well, even, so then even if you run, uh, run a study that maybe didn't fail to replicate, but you're the researcher, you ran the study and then once you were done and got your results, you say, well, the hypothesis just didn't show up with a signal. Like those, that is a viable resource. You know, if, if somebody has tried, uh, X combined with B and it didn't, uh, didn't show any result and they didn't publish, well now there's 300 other researchers somewhere in the world who are getting the idea of like, well, what if these two things, and if they don't have a resource where they can check if this has been done, then how do they know not to do it? Because whether it's an animal study or a psychological study or whatever the, if you don't have a, it would be a great research we could go like, does this been looked at before? Right? Can I say, oh, there's 15 different studies that tried to connect these and found no link and no association or no, uh, But they went about it with this particular, particular methodology. And maybe if I try it this way, it'll be, you know, so that like said, more fruitful pathways. Exactly. It's just difficult because I completely agree with you, but, um, journals really want to have, articles that are going to be, you're right, we want an impact factor. We want side-takes. And we'll try some studies, but we won't, we will side-studies that get significant results. We don't side-studies that don't. And so you need to find, you need to not do that. Yeah. I think it would be interesting because I think you could at some point incentivize citing no results. We looked at this because we saw 10, you know, the, you know, these studies had no result, these studies had no result, these studies had no, and cite them. This is why we went in this direction because we saw unpromising research in the other direction. Like it seems like it could be cited. But if the, if it's with the, right. Yeah. But if the, if we're, if we're putting those things in initially and like registering the studies and then it doesn't work out, then it's like, okay, that was done. But also then if it gets listed in like a journal, then that goes into the database that people are using to, you know, there are a lot of people putting, using these large language models and data models to be able to start creating better search algorithms for scientists so that you can find better, do a better literature search, you know, and wouldn't it be great to know not just good stuff. We use this already in, you know, when you're getting into phase two, phase three clinical trials of a drug, these are all pre-registered. Right. And the results are their results. Right. And we actually accelerate quite a bit of knowledge that way with everything that fails and most things put into that pipeline fail. Majority of things put into the clinical trials don't have the results that they were hoping for expecting. But every time that happens, it is searchable. You can look at methods, dosage amounts, what were the interactions that there were, the mechanisms that they were hoping would take place. And then you can ask, why didn't it work? Yeah, I can see why it should have. Is there something in between? Is it mitigating the response or was it just the dosages were not right or is this just, just doesn't work? And I think that a lot of scientists, you know, I was worked under Neil Sharkey who was at UC Davis, the head of the orthopedics research lab went on to do head of research and development at Penn State. And he had told me at one point that something like 90% of animal trials and experimentation in orthopedics has been done probably at every university. Because this is also this very long time ago. This is almost before like a shared internet environment, right? But that information, because it's not shared, those studies keep getting repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated for people trying to connect what should be logical connections but aren't there. And so yeah, the journal of null result of the lack of confirmation, the journal that I think would be a wonderful database for people to be able to search before engaging in their own research to see the pitfalls that have come. The literature review, right? Yeah. Well, you know, the Center for open science has already been mentioned and that one of their tools, one of their resources is the open science framework. And that's just wonderful because it has a built in pre registration system and you can search it, you can not just search the published literature but also search OSF to see what other people have tried the similar type of thing to find those kinds of null results. Nice. Oh, that's brilliant. Yeah. And you can say, Oh, hey, I wanted to do this study this way. And then if somebody's doing something, you can reach out and be like, Hey, I'm going to do it like this. Do you want to collaborate or not? And, you know, suddenly maybe you're, you know, actually working together and driving things forward faster. Yeah, absolutely. It is 1030 here on the Western Hemisphere, which is getting a little late. I know some of our viewers are on the East Coast. So I'm respecting the super late nighttime of some of these people and the ever, I can't say earlier, it's the later morning for Justin. He's just getting more awake. The marked in our discord chat room just shared this robot. I want to because we ended on the robot noises, shared this robot that our robot story reminded him of. Lobster robots. And this is supported looks like by DARPA. So these military lobster robots, this is just what it's out there. Yep. Boy and see, they say they're boy and see claws. It's a lot of fun. Thank you for sharing that on the discord. That's super fun. But it's only 1130. What Kyle is fantastic. Where's Kira 130 AM where can that even be? Kira Cent, 130 is it would be 1231 30 East Coast East Coast or Canada. Oh yeah. Like I said, oh, because I keep looking at it. I'm like, that doesn't make any. Oh, of course that makes sense. Yeah, you're six hours away from eight hours. Time. It's play. We really, we really need to get play tectonics and time zones. We need to all to have the same time zone and just just get on the same page. Oh, there you go. Thanks for joining us from Billy Kira. That's awesome. All right, Steve, thank you once again for joining us. This has been super fun. Thanks for staying up late with us. Great talking with you both. Yeah, it's been wonderful. I will, I will see Steve. Nice to meet you. Hope I see you again in life. Kiki, I will hopefully see you again in life because I'll only be next week. And if I don't, then that is a real problem. And everyone, I will say we hope to see you again next week. And in the meantime, stay safe, stay healthy, stay curious, and stay lucky. Good night. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
