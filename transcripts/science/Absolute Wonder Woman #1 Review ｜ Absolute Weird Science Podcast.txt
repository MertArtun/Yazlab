 I am entropy. I am death. I am Darkseid. From the ashes they will rise In a well of dark sides twisted lies Absolutely sea, where darkness waits Weird science breaks the chains So gather round, hear the call Dying deep with glory, all absolute with science Absolute with science Here we are It is Kelly Thompson Some people have been a little wary about it But we really did like the Batman I hope you can convince me to like this a little more I don't hate it There's not much going on But it's still better than anything Kelly Thompson has done at DC It's just that I don't know I kind of expected it to be bigger and more But it's more of let's get to know exactly what sets up this Wonder Woman And you said from all the previews that this was the book that you were looking forward to You were really looking forward to because of the look, the art The art seems to, I don't know, some reason I think that the art might be something that either you're going to like Because it might remind you of Chiang's art A Wonder Woman and New 52 of parts Or maybe you wouldn't like it, I don't know, we're going to have to see But we are going to get into this You give us the credits and away we go Absolute Wonder Woman, number one Written by Kelly Thompson with Arfi Hayden Sherman Jordy Belair and Becca Carey And the idea of getting more I actually went less of the actual Wonder Woman in this Because we do start out this whole thing I want more of a story of what's this going to mean More of how the sets up in things is what I thought You keep going Because the thing, story sets like starts out with the idea of this thing coming down This upside down pyramid coming over in Gateway City And everybody scrambling to figure out what's going on When all these red monsters come running about And out of nowhere this Absolute Wonder Woman comes to save the day And then we go back to the origins of the Absolute Wonder Woman And I wish we could actually just have a slow burn Well that's what I'm saying When I say I want more, I don't want more of say the origins I think we do get to, I think that what I mean is Really the overall story If you don't have a flashback in this Wonder Woman shows up, says I'm going to take care of this, boom, done I mean really that's it And I want less of that And I would want it to be that she comes in We find out maybe if people have heard of her Then that kind of develops into maybe something that strikes a flashback at the beginning But you pretty much have a set up And then a flashback origin that lasts The rest of the issue until the last couple pages And I think that what I mean more is the overall story Of why we want to be here and if you're in now I'm fine with learning about Wonder Woman's past And wondering what she's doing over the next five issues I mean it could be like you said a slow burn Where we see it naturally kind of progress Things happen and whatnot It ends up getting us going But by the end you really are just getting an origin The origin I'm going to say It's fun, it's neat, it's different But overall I don't think it needed to be a whole issue Because really it's kind of just her sitting around It's kind of her like five issues of her sitting around with Cersei Racing her as a mother-daughter It shouldn't be sitting around I mean that's all it really is It's like a wild isle of hell The prison of the great sorceress Cersei So basically what you need to do Is and they do it enough But you know Cersei falls kind of falls in love with her She doesn't want to And then in the meantime the whole play was Apollo Brings And very very as a role-as in my mind New 52 kind of play And it's funny because most people ended up saying That a lot of this felt like I mean it's the absolute universe It did feel like the how they spelled it out A little darker a little It feel like what they said about the new 52 Not that all the things are exactly the same But it does feel like that kind of play And I had that vibe Apollo comes down says hey This girl here she's an Amazon We're never going to allow you to say this And we want them to disappear It feels like as if they can't or won't Kill her themselves So we're just going to leave her Pretty much what I figured is Apollo and all the gods are sitting around like We have to get rid of this girl We can't kill her ourselves That's not right Well the gods first off it's weird Because nothing's right or wrong with them But what should we do Somebody comes up Apollo says Hey how about this Cersei let's just make Cersei the mother Because boy Cersei's going to let this girl Die within two seconds She doesn't care about anything She's terrible whatever And lo and behold She's not as bad as they think And she ends up falling in love With Diana and Diana being This girl who's you know Pretty able right away I mean things start to attack And it's not like they're going to send They're not going to send things They're sending things to kill Diana And it's just not working Because Diana is pretty good Because creatures are coming Like a giant snake This like you know Serverous manticore looking thing But when Apollo comes This baby is Diana Princess of Themyscara She is the last of the Amazons And she has been taken from them By my father Zeus As punishment for their crimes Against the gods Her home is now hell And you are her warden She may never again be reunited With her Amazons sisters And they will be imprisoned for eternity When their service to my father ends And you may never say the word Amazon again And it's such a weird idea Because when Cersei does take the baby Diana And puts it in her cave on her wild island hell The idea she is just going to let this go And a gigantic red serpent comes out of nowhere And she just goes and grabs it So it can't attack her And it feels very reminiscent of Hercules' origins With Hera sending the snakes to kill them As a child So even when Apollo comes here And the idea of like the Amazons are sent in I don't know if this is actually the gods And Zeus declaring this whole thing Because the baby has powers along the lines Of like the Hercules Well the baby is They're playing like a demo Yeah exactly a demo So if you go by the current Tom King Who knows But still going to the devil Yeah the baby gods that she is But it feels more like something that Apollo was put up to by Hera And sends this whole thing out And doesn't even know the idea of the Like the Amazons and what it will be Because she just doesn't want Diana To know her origins through Cersei And again if you end up and you would go With this idea If you go to Cersei just And I think Kelly Thompson is doing a good job Of playing it up First off Cersei is going to hate Everything about what Diana would be You know that she just wanted the While it's not set up yet here But you play that trope But again like you said If you look at her And you look at the things The thing that they don't realize Is Cersei is very depressed I mean she's there And what is she doing Getting cockles out of the shoreline And she's upset She's miserable Even as you see the serpent She says pretty much You know what am I supposed to do here What the hell I'm just going to let it die I'm not going to try I'm not going to kill it But it's going to die anyway I'm just going to put it down Even when you have the serpent come The fire breathing lizards Cersei does not care She is depressed She's just watching it She's watching like Okay let's see what happens Okay Diana grabs it Throws it away And right at that point Suddenly there's a little smirk With Cersei of like Almost like the idea like Oh this could be kind of fun It's not at that point Like oh my god I love this kid or whatever Wouldn't yet But then the next thing is The fire breathing serpent And sees that guy And she's just doing her culture She's not going to stop This thing from doing anything It does breathe fire at Diana And then Diana grabs it And kisses it And it's not like this is some kind of dragon This is just like a little lizard You find on like an actual The actual world This happens to be able to breathe A little bit of fire at you Yeah again you say that Against a baby It might be great But again she The hair doesn't Cersei doesn't jump into it She's already seen this gigantic Serpent come from the baby The baby just grabs it And then he yeets it So obviously the baby has A bit of strength and durability And also even as she's saying though She says you know The gods send one thing after another To kill this child until it's done If they do she's doomed Whatever I take an interest or not So she's like I don't really care The funny thing is at one point And again I like the origin In a way of not just the surface Little things I love the idea of Cersei Suddenly becoming a good mother It makes me laugh And it's done well because Suddenly when she's talking At one point she says the same line But says the things that they've sent To kill her oh I mean us And it becomes like a family I mean she is amused by the baby At this one point And if the baby lives whatever She'll see but I think that she Thinks eventually they'll up the ante This baby will die I don't care I'm going to pretend I don't care I'm going about my own things But even the idea that Diana Ends up kissing this thing It goes no no And ends up kissing it And it does go away then In the deal of you know Oh my god like this thing Actually sends the love It's very odd and then she says She's going to learn the hard way With that one He'll singe off all her hair next time But he doesn't And I think that it's one of those Even this thing comes back later on Because as she starts growing up This baby She almost has a snow white quality I can go back and watch that Where like you know The woodland creatures all come to snow White like you know The ants around the forest They all come back Even the snake that tried to eat her Initially comes back Even Mikey from Monster's Inc But it ends up being red Little red Mikey Little red Mikey But that's the thing of this Is the idea of the progression Where she and even then This compassion shows through And that's really good The way that it's done And the way of not forcing it Some people may not even get it But you end up then where At one point again Diana's Just like walking around She's learning to walk But on her own Cersei's on the other side Knitting She's not involved Then you see Cersei see Diana Running around with these monsters And she's playing with them She's like pretending She's a monster And they're pretending they're afraid And they're running She's not in danger of them anymore And then you see the next And it's done in these wide You know full page spread things And then at the bottom Where she says even And she had a quality That's softening the most Triptych or speace And you do see a cool little thing Where she's getting up a shadow By a magical Crazy rain cloud That's really neat But again the surroundings They're awful It's hell even at one point Cersei's like you can't raise A baby here But she has an insist I don't just mean all the little Creatures and demons And lost souls that drifted to her And she means her as well I mean she thinks of herself As a treacherous beast Obviously it says it's everything Then you see her putting her to bed She's starting to care I was waiting for her to get One of those candles And like boom right on there But she ends up like And she's like Boom right on there But she ends up like It says how you fall in love with a child Is by raising it So she's admitting I'm falling in love with this baby And what I do like is The way they play it out Normally you might think that Cersei would say like No way whatever But you already established that She can melt the hearts of the treacherous Be that she has And it's really really good It's really good again And the way the cave is set up Throughout these progressions too That Cersei's holding the cave is It gets lighter right Holy n*** it gets lighter But like on one side It was like you know Just some moss on the side Where Cersei would sweep herself And as you progress Cersei's made herself some own bedding She's made bedding for the baby And then there's bookshelves The bookshelves The big picture of her as Diana Starts growing up More decorations all around That instead When it started out She was a depressed old hag Sitting outside getting She was imprisoned in hell She was imprisoned in hell Yeah and again What they have done is They in my mind And I think that at one point Say it is her And usually the deal Ends up like What do you mean they're getting along Like and again I think we're still going to deal With some of this stuff And then Hera's get Because they thought That they give this as a joke It's like one of those The cruel jokes of the gods Will let the baby live But Cersei will be the mother So she's going to die Plus we're going to send things To a tiger Like there's no way Instead of just And those things end up sleeping In bed with Wonder Woman As she sleeps as a child Yeah it's crazy And the idea of all this Is the play of When you read these stories And a lot of comics And anything in movies But you think of the idea Of like Why don't you just kill her He went through this thing Because I thought it was going to be funny They're probably watching At this point They probably forgot Or whatever But the idea again Of that not being able to say Amazon But in the meantime of seeing And like you said This isn't her just Taking care of Diana And raising her It's also the idea Of her taking care of herself And her not being as depressed Everything gets like more life Everything gets brighter And like you said And I didn't really Recognize exactly Yeah And what it reminds me of Is the You thought I was You know I thought I was teaching you Though this is my favorite I thought I was teaching you You were teaching me But it's given hope To Cersei And yes she says I fall in love And I'm raising this child And then you do see Like each time you see it And you're right Each time you gain More and more until What you end up having Is like Man that's a pretty nice place Even to the point where she It's nicer than my house Like they don't They don't even end up Like I'd love because I'm not a hovel They don't even end up Like I'd love the idea Where we're saying that It took too long Now I'm really liking it Talking about it But the idea like What happened if we went five Is are we gonna see the Planks being put down So they have a wooden floor Because it goes to the back too You even have carpet At times and stuff like that Where But the idea of me Wanting more of this Because when we actually have All of this great background Of Diana being raised in hell By Mother Cersei Even being taught Witchcraft by the like You know Cersei This master sorceress I like all these new aspects Of Wonder Woman And when they were Get thrown back in the present day Where Wonder Woman is just In man's world Defending men because The Amazons are on their note Is they're banished I'm like I don't want to see this Yeah, like she has All of these tools That Cersei has given her To go and be herself Because she even goes on Like the way you love a child Is to buy raising it But then the way you really Love a child is by letting them go And this is the whole Idea of Wonder Woman Going to man's world Rising up from hell With her skeleton pegasus And the way that it goes And the way that it goes But I want to see All of these things In hell that Cersei is able to Perture like the new lasso The sword by Athena All of these cool things That she has Even putting down All of these magical runes As tattoos on Wonder Woman Yeah, and maybe what was We haven't seen it Maybe we'll see that Some of these were discarded I don't know But I think that now You're saying that it's making More sense to me Even how I feel And maybe what it would be Instead of being a long burn Slow burn five issues of origin Maybe it would have been Better served And we say this about A lot of things Not as much the Batman Because the Batman Seemed to go okay With the way that was set up And your dealing He said maybe this should have Had a zero issue Maybe it would have been The idea of here's the origin Boom because I'm really liking Maybe you expand the origin To get to And then at the very end Amazon hey That means you have to Protect the world Okay I'm going to do this And then you see this Arbiter thing Because what ends up happening It really does feel like When they editorial Whatever with Kelly Thompson They said listen You did really good With this origin stuff That's really cool But we have to have something In the present that has to have Action And it really falls flat Well not only that I think they really want to Show off the new look For one or one or two It really falls flat though And where I'm saying that Maybe by the end of this You have oh my god I'm supposed to protect Man's world But maybe the first thing The last thing you see The first thing of her Is a cliffhanger page Maybe a spread of her And that kick ass You know that huge sword From cloud from Final Fantasy 7 Like that sort of thing You go oh shit I want to see What this is all about Because at the end of this You're more impressed With her look maybe If you don't like it You don't like it But I like it I think she was a bad ass And so you're more impressed Like you said You have questions about Okay that last soul What you doing the sword All that is the But I'm not sitting there Saying oh man that was awesome That was cool monster That was there Oh my god she's nothing Of that I'm more excited about her look And what it might mean And yeah the fight whatever But that's not what I was excited About I see her maybe Could have just done that Even the warrior ass That thing that she has here Because you know We know that she's trained in magic And all this other stuff Being raised by Cersei But the Amazon instincts Because even when the palo comes down He bans the word Amazon magically So like Cersei can't even say it But deep in like Wonder Woman's like brain She knows this forbidden word And she's afraid of what it will mean If she does say it Because she's afraid of the change But she eventually comes out And says Amazon Like what does that mean It's what you are Say it again Amazon Like thrust herself back to the present And when Wonder Woman is fighting this monster This harbinger at first She dips her fingers in its blood And covers her eyes with it Like a warrior ass And I'm like that is really badass But I want to see where all this comes from Because right now we see her being raised Pretty gently for the most part Of showing compassion to the demons And animals of hell that we have Yeah I mean but she learns witchcraft But there's all these other layers Through that I want to see And I don't want to see it through the present Like I want to see the For the flashback all the way through To where she probably does come to me as well I don't know if you'll have to see the deal I mean and maybe that's Maybe that is it Maybe we're going to just five issues Of the origin no other So when you end up where Again I think that there's cool things With Kelly Thompson and say the birds That birds are pretty good Whatever people are just listening To the absolute stuff now Which I see there are a lot of people Who must have joined in For us talking about absolute Batman I got a lot of people listening That first episode we even had some people Bat dad ended up mentioning And I give him a shout out That he ended up saying that Arbor view and I haven't heard Or talked to him in a while Somebody who is a friend of the show And I was glad that he is still Checking in or what not But if you are listening We do not like the birds of prey one bit I mean that book is nonsense And it's not like there's no subtlety to it There's no anything What it is is just bad So when you read this I'm amazed at the subtlety of it And when I'm saying even that Where there is Wonder Woman And I don't think Cersei wants Wonder Woman to leave Wonder Woman is now her daughter Who is really good at that I think she needs her too though I know she does But the thing is She's also not going to push it But she also says that Come from Diana once again Like she says And it's Cersei who says You're afraid of the change that word will bring But that word, the change is That she's going to realize that she has a duty And ask to leave So I think it's one of those where It's a depressing thing But they both need to do it You have to do it You're growing up And then when she says Like listen Say the word Diana Say it and know it is what you are And she says it But then again Cersei has to keep saying Like listen Don't just say it You have to want to be it That's what you are You have to mean it And the thing is In that deal It makes so much sense to me In a weird way That Cersei There's a curse on that word But not for Diana She can't say it Diana's a little girl from there She can say it But they never thought She lived this long Because Cersei is an awful person Who would never take care of Her blood would speak to her And let her know what she is And maybe again I don't think they look past two weeks It's a baby they gave to Cersei I don't think And she put it in like a A bath of lava She's like Yeah, put it there And I think they counted on that And them sending those I don't think they were testing her I think that they thought that would End her And they didn't realize that And I don't think they realized The strength of her And I think they probably said If the whole deal Hey, we did that with Hercules So that's Hercules Let's send it to this girl And then Cersei But says Listen, when Apollo first brought you to me He banned me from ever again Saying that word And why? Why would they do that? And this is why indeed My darling girl And it's like I don't know of this And she's crying now I mean, they're both crying Because they know what this means She's gonna have to leave But it's what she has to do And there's like She could say right now Scroll it She could say No, thank you Like Tom King would ever say But you know This Wonder Woman's a hero And says Okay, I gotta do it But it doesn't want to And then Cersei's It's like What it is at this point Seriously, it's not your fault It's not Don't say it It's not your fault She doesn't want to hear it But she knows she has to And she knows she has to go And then what Cersei's trying to explain But can't say it And I like the idea We don't love the Wingdings We don't love Redacted I love the way that it looks like A curse has wiped it out Amazon has been scratched away Yeah, so she's like Because of that And so she's trying to say She can't So it's like And you know How did you have to do They protected the world above From the oldest of monsters Which won only the feast on it Without the blank The world above never makes it You can say Amazon's it's fine Yeah, I'm saying what she's saying So she can't say it And then that's where Dianna says Amazon, Amazon, Amazon Again, Amazon And then she just keeps yelling again Again, it reminds me Of so many things It also reminds me of Miracle Who are you Oh, I'm from Minnesota State And then finally It's like, no, I'm Team USA And they start yelling And off they go They realize their purpose And together And then finally You get those eyes that she says Amazon And it's like, holy crap Like that's pretty good The way that that was set up Is really good Problem is, like you said You also have up the present And you want to know more About how these things came about Because you've got some really cool things Going on in the past And when she shows up all badass With all her weaponry And we're like, you know Skeleton Pegasus and Mike I just wish we could have seen That progression We do end on a really cool like note That when she gets back up With the idea of Amazon And her mind remembering What her mother told her And stuff like that When she goes up against this Harbinger primus Threatening the man's world Right now she's like For I am Diana And a Themyscara Last of the Amazon's daughter Of Cersei Princess of Hell Which of the wild Isle And you will not have this world Well, I still draw breath Yup, and it's awesome And again, if anybody Everybody has their own opinion Please, everybody can decide If they like this or not But I think that the idea If you don't like this And you start bringing up Like if you don't like it Don't think of anything of Well, this is pushing this agenda It's not, it's a really good start To a new version of Wonder Woman That may not completely Make complete sense to us yet But everything that I see Is pretty damn cool And it twists it in a way That instead of just saying Hey, here's Batman Like I'm not gonna make fun Of the Batman Because I thought that was good But it's not going out And saying like, oh, by the way Wonder Woman is now this Because I just want to do the opposite I'm not gonna think this through or what not What it does is set up that somebody is To gods or against the Amazon So that sets up an overall thing That's really cool And the idea that they thought They were just discarding her But then Cersei, one of her big villains In the regular deal Is actually becomes a great mother And raises her properly, I guess And my parents fire her Which I love these positions We find ourselves in the absolute power Like that, absolute universe so far Where in Batman we have the closest friends Of Bruce Wayne Or his biggest rogues gallery In the main universe Here we have Cersei One of the biggest enemies Wonder Woman is her mother figure here I like these positions Yes, maybe it'll get like stale If we keep having this over and over again But right now, so far, it's really far We haven't read, obviously We haven't read Superman But if we get to Superman It's like, oh no, my dad, Lex Luthor That I might have a problem I might be like, we're going a little too far But even then You mentioned the idea of Cersei Being Wonder Woman's mother in this And yet I didn't think like as I'm reading Like here we go again They did that in Batman But now you say it It makes sense what you're saying But it didn't feel like Oh, they're going with a cliche to do that I just thought the idea where they did think out Let's make Wonder Woman different What we can do is It's not that she's different It's that things have happened to her To try to make her less or dead And things have gone a different way But it's still Wonder Woman She's still the compassion is there We see her with these I mean when you actually then see Those monsters sleeping Whether it's the cutest thing ever And you realize at first like Yeah, she's a pet and or stuffed animal Yeah, that's it And it's the idea too Is she's playing with them Ah, I'm a rabbit She's real little But they stuck with her It's really nice And the really subtle I said subtle way of seeing A very dark and muddy cave That Cersei lived in Nisrable to suddenly get a little lighter Get a little well done And yeah, it ends up where Diana has inspired This havaliah has become a home Yeah, exactly And so that even gets you the idea Of Cersei would definitely not like I don't want her to go But I know I have to And really is the nicest Cersei We've ever seen in our lives Because Diana was there And she raised her And Diana's just her goodness And all that It helped her Now in the meantime What's really cool and I think Why you really like it too Is that Cersei's still Cersei This isn't like Cersei's like Oh, I'm not going to teach her This black magic No, that's what she knows That's what she's teaching her We want to see more of that And I do want to see more of that To tell you all these things I want to see how it works out But in that I think it would be really cool When you start thinking of down the line When they kind of have to come together In the trinity already A Batman and this one It seems like Boy, that might cause some fr... Like it's neat I think that that would be cool Because it won't be like the normal deal Steve Trevor didn't crash Oh my God, the man's... No, she found out She saw him in hell Yeah, and we're in hell And Diana still ends up finding out That the Amazons have a duty That they always protect the outside world They always protect Man's World But just the world itself They're not going to go with Man's World, babe But that's the beauty of an Amazon See, it's such a good idea Because again, I don't know Where we're going to go from this origin But I've still under the idea that The Amazons, while Cersei believes That they used to protect Man's World I think the idea of Themyscara and Paradise Like the whole idea that They're locked away from Man's World I think Gods might have done that As a punishment to Them And that's the whole idea And she thinks that she's the last Amazon While they're still locked away And I think they are And I think that one of the things going on Again, the Gods are assholes They always are And I'm talking more Greek and Roman Gods Right, the Roman fingers But they end up where They like to do their nonsense And also these monsters And I think that it is one of those That we get rid of the Amazons We can just do what the hell we want And then the monsters are taking a van You know, you have all that And how that brings out I still think it's the idea of like Slight against terror So like the idea that Zeus So like had sex with Apolloda Apolloda had a baby Same as Hercules in my mind I think that's like where we would be going And we just would like to leave her mess I'm still going on that I think it's a little more than just that Because it seems like the regular world Like the Gods either have gone to sleep And don't even pay attention Because it looks like some shit's really going down Especially the way it's spelled out And I think that it might be that too But I think that it might be Maybe whatever we find Maybe some of the Gods have been in prison Maybe they're this Maybe I don't know We'll have to find out We'll have to find out And that might even lead to how some of these weapons Some of these things going Again, usually Diana will have like gifted things Oh, I got this from Athena I got this from that A lot of times with that And I don't know how that works here Because she's kind of from hell Which is another thing that goes to one of my Nitpicks of the story Whether you think it's logical or not But the way we started all of this off For the Absolute Universe We had the idea after Absolute Power Where the Multiverse was shut down Darkseid went crazy Because he has never been this powerful before All his avatars throughout the Multiverse Were closed off to him All his power came back to him He wasn't able to be out there in the Multiverse And that should be the same thing Since he's a God of the Fourth World A God of the Third World Like Apollo and the rest Shouldn't be able to be in this universe So him being here and doing this whole thing With the Gods It feels again a little nitpicky But I feel like there could be a thing that's like Kind of goes against what we've already established I think there's just a weird little thing that When they did go and I've been told recently Like the idea of the Absolute Feel And you know that special And people are more confused than they are either Because when you do end up having boost or go That doesn't seem like that might be in the future of this And that would change things and maybe we're leading to that Maybe we have to stop, I don't know I don't know how this whole thing is When the Omega power that the Darkseid has contains Went out there and created the Elf World Into the Earth Omega or the Omega Earth Whatever it is at this point And became the Absolute Universe Like that was out there and it's shut I'm trying to think of how I'm going to do this I'm telling you, I think at this point We can't worry about it And I think that when the things come about They will explain the full I think that it was not really well explained I mean even you trying to come up with You're going to have to go and kind of I had a point that I just kind of lost track Because I forgot where I was starting from Or where I was going But again, like I and I We talked about this last two weeks ago When Absolute Batman came out And the idea of the ultimate universe And talked about the Maker And I said a lot of people heard Oh my God, this ultimate Spider-Man is great And they jumped in because of what they could get And I think there's a lot of people That are going to do that here So I do think that by the time And I think of the Ultimate Universe When we get to the point where the Maker comes back First up, I'm not looking forward to that But when it does, they're going to have to explain things So if anything, you could go with it I'm just saying that I think right now They're trying to say, let's tell these stories We're not going to deal with the ins and outs Of what it might mean with the overall continuity Of Dark Side and what happened But eventually they'll re-explain it And they'll make more sense later Because I think they just want people to read it I just remember my point of where I was going That whole rant about the Omega Effect Going and then creating the absolute universes But the idea was it gave time It gave all of our history to that world as well So it had already had a lived in history And again, I'm not going to hinge on I just want good stories And I hope that when we do get to the point where Whatever, an event or whatever it will lead to What they say will eventually that you end up Or like, okay, that makes sense And I'll tell them, I'll be like Erickson And they'll move them in the sense Because right now I'm just like, this is a really neat Wonder Woman This could be instead of just an absolute Wonder Woman As an ongoing other universe This could just be a black label book It could be an Elf's World's book of art It could be a what if It is an Elf's World's book about Gem I'm saying it is But it's also all in because it's connected to the deal And I just, I'm going to go with that Because I thought it was pretty good It is really good I think I like Batman more of the idea of In the here and now of okay, this is pretty cool Maybe the thing is, Batman we don't really know All of the things, like that was kind of brushless And he's there doing some stuff that we don't This ends up where, okay, I see where she's coming from Compassion and all that But she also has magic Like the whole concept is really cool It's a really neat way to do it And again, it feels to me a lot like the new 52 Asirello and just the kind of the gods and stuff Whatever it might be But I thought the art was pretty good Especially when you start seeing it develop I think it's a style that I did have to get used to a little But boy, when you see that turn And even when you see Wonder Woman The first couple pages Because you know, the world's being attacked There's that upside down pyramid Things are coming out And when she comes in, she just looks badass I do like, this is where again This is where I think that one of the things That Kelly Thompson came out and people were upset She said there's going to be like a built-in feminism It's going to be like, and people are like Oh, what that means is it's a female character That's raised by, like that's what it is And what ended up I It's her seeing Diana against the world It's not even like I got an argument with somebody But I said, I think that is something that's a given Why would you bring it up? And then this person said to me Well, you have to bring it up Because then people won't think I'm like, no, no, no When you bring it up It feels like you're trying to force something That has always been there You don't need to do that A Wonder Woman book does have feminism And it's Wonder Woman And the Amazons are not the Amazons Seriously, all that And so when I read this The only thing that you have is one line And it's right away He's diving, don't lose him I'm not sure that's what's going to say a guy A man, that's it That's all it was Because they see this badass And they think it's a man But it's not And then you even have a point Where she's taking your leader kind of deal And the one guy, oh, I see you're not the leader Let me go And she is one She's to the point again And bitch in charge And that's Cersei Again, Cersei and this is really a nice mom Cersei's always also somebody who demands to be You know, you get that feel of Oh, yeah, that's Cersei's daughter, all right Like, she's going to be nice She's going to do this But what she wants, something She demands to suspect She's saying, you tell me who it is I don't need to talk to you Tell me who it is And I like that as well And when you see everybody The sword was what people were upset about Everybody talked about it's like Oh, she's going to hold the That sword is badass She's cutting the heads off of these things That's a family of the issue Holy moly, it's the beginning And she's just wrecking the house And it does It looks like cloud sword from Final Fantasy VII You know what I love? Cloud sword from Final Fantasy VII I love Squall Final Fantasy VII Don't like Squall, get out of here with that That Final Fantasy VIII He was like That was like the 90210 version Of the whole deal of the Final Fantasy I love cloud And the sword's badass The reason why it was so huge Because it's badass, it's badass And the helmet, everything That has a very Aries look to it It really works Because she's on hell I think it's really cool But what would you give it? I would give it a 7.8 out of 10 I enjoy this issue I just wish we could stay with the origins more Than the main line You know, timeline Where she's coming to man's world And fighting harbingers From whatever doom is there about to bring The art's great And again, I have some quibbles About the idea of the gods And how they can exist outside of the Like the multiverse The way the multiverse works right now But it can either be here or there You can say it works this way or not But this is how I feel I have no quibbles And I'm way more positive than you I'm Sydney Krosby, 8.7 It's a score I don't think I've given in a while 8.7 is a weird score Because it's weird Usually we'll give an 8.9 Because it's not quite a 9 But I was gonna give an 8.8 I'm like, no, it's quite there But I love... Because again, there's things that mean you like this And one of the things that I like Is like this psychology of it You know, man But the idea of that Yeah, not you Never let psychology be here, you like it I know, I'm saying the psychology of her being depressed And then coming back It's the thing that I... I do talk about that a lot Of the moments where you get feel moments Because, oh, you know, the father and this and that But I got that from this I like seeing Cersei Ends up becoming nicer Because Diana and what Kelly Thompson does Is show the compassion and the love Even from other things In a way that isn't like I said, she does mention Like, oh, she like... But it's not like we had so many people On Wonder Woman in the regular continuity of Boy, you know, it's about telling the truth And that's all we get True, true, true, she's the truth She does this for the compassion And it has to be spelled out Every sort of panel in a narration box Instead of just showing it And I see that So I do my job and convince you that it's a good book? Yeah, I'm telling you And when I first started reading it And I did, the only thing that I was upset about Was the lack of a regular story in the here and now Thinking the idea of, well, Batman, we got that We know where it's going, we kind of do At this, you kind of end And you're like, I don't know what's happening with this whole And I really don't care about the regular in the deal But once we started, and I started looking at it again Especially in the art, yeah, I really liked it When we first started, I was probably at like a little Maybe an eight, but I did go up for like an eight, seven So I do like these I'm hoping Superman continues the deal We've even had, we've had some other things Being announced and things like that Some things look a little sus We'll see how that goes down the line But... You talking about Martian Man, Hunter? I am talking about Martian Man, Hunter And I'm not just talking about the look of that It's Dennis Camp who is doing one of my Least favorite ultimate books The Ultimate Universities doing the ultimates And I think it's complete another garbage So I'm worried, I'm worried about that book But we'll see, we'll see And the thing is too, what I should do Is not even look at anything from here Until it comes out, because everything I see Or what he's been saying Just gets me more and more angry Because he's, I just don't think he's done good But we'll see, everybody can write a good book And we, as I said, we don't love the Kelly Thompson stuff On the regular deal, but this is, I think, her best thing She has done here, let's keep our fingers crossed That it's maybe because she has a strong editorial presence here Maybe this is just something she's inspired with Because it's pretty cool But that is it, that is it for this Thanks everybody for listening And I hope that you enjoy the absolute deal What we'll do is we'll set up, as we get more books on the reg Where we would have, say, you know, a book a week or whatnot We'll start talking about it We take emails and things like that Usually that goes horribly wrong for us And then we never have a way But even if the idea of you could just get a hold of us To let us know, hey, do you like this, whatnot That would be kind of nice for us, we'll spell that out later One of the things I do want to mention before we leave though Is if you want to hear us talk about other things Especially if this is the first thing you've heard Or maybe just this and that And you're like, I like the Cutter Barak's Gib What you can do is first off, listen to our regular podcast That we do each week, we haven't missed a week in ten years or so It's nonsense, I've been getting held for that the past couple months But the idea where you can go and it's on the feed This very feed comes out every Sunday night If you want early access to this show And that each one a day early You can go to our Patreon, patreon.com Slash Weird Science Any level including the lowest one that's a dollar Thank you, Holler, you'll be able to hear this show And the other early access a day before each level gives you more Including what me and Erica are going to be going off to do In just a second, we have a spotlight each and every week Two of the books that come out each and every week from DC Are picked by the badasses to get fresh And they end up deciding what books they want us to talk about And that is on a Patreon exclusive spotlight show Like I said, every Thursday night usually A little earlier this week, Eric has a Halloween party to go to As he is going as the specter And we all want to see pictures of that But this week the badasses are here Power Girl number 14, I might be able to slip one in on the Facebook Sometimes you look at it, so Power Girl number 14 or somebody else does And also from the DC Vault Death in the Family Or as Eric says, Robin lives Number four, a book that we've actually been enjoying the ends this week So we'll be going off and talking about the mouth This isn't quite as long as the Batman absolute deal But again, we just talk as long as we do There's no set deal We used to say this at the beginning, I just want to point out New people listening, it's not like we're going to say we have to be a half hour And we'll cut things out, we just go until we are done And we're done now So Eric, what do we say at the end of the absolute DC podcast?
