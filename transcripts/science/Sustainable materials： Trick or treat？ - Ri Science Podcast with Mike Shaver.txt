 Tomorrow is Halloween, which means lots of sweets and chocolate if you're lucky. But with all those treats comes even more wrappers and therefore even more waste. I'm sure we've all noticed in recent years that an increasing amount of packaging is now advertised as sustainable in some way. But is it really? A couple of weeks ago, Polymer scientist and sustainability expert Mike Shaver joined us at the RI to give a talk about his work in sustainable material development. I managed to nab him for a chat a couple of hours before his talk to find out how to make my Halloween as sustainable as possible. Mike, thank you so much for joining me today. Your team up in Manchester look at sustainable material design, particularly concerning plastics. Obviously plastic pollution is a mammoth problem to tackle, but in order to create a better alternative, we need to fully understand their role in our society. In places like supermarkets and shops on the high street, why were plastics introduced in the first place? I think that's a really important question. I think the first thing to think about is what the alternatives were, right? And so you used to go to a shop and you used to buy something which might not have any packaging at all. So we think about some of the items we would have bought from a grocery shop. But actually the real benefit of introducing plastics and packaging were really twofold. So the first is that they could increase the shelf life of materials and that would prevent food from spoiling. And actually the carbon footprint of food is actually higher than the package itself in many instances, in most instances really. And so we were able to both prevent food from spoiling and get a really secure and more efficient supply chain for that food while keeping our carbon footprint low. And the second thing is actually spoilage. The consequence of that food going off is that food is a lot safer than it used to be. So we have fewer people who are going to get sick from food. We now see that food recalls are very rare. And that's because the plastic can offer a lot of protection for those materials. And because that offers protection while being a really efficient material to make and a very lightweight material, so an efficient material to transport, makes it very sustainable. And when you then look at the difference between purpose and what some of the marketing is on new packaging, it becomes a real challenge to unpick as a consumer. Yeah, I think plastic is often painted as all these questions are often kind of preaching, stop using single use plastics, but A, that's kind of impossible. But B, that might not necessarily be a good idea because they're there for a reason and they do help a lot of things. And I think that that's especially true when we look past the bit of our world, which we demonize the most in terms of plastic, the grocery store. So we think about hospitals and why they have plastics. They actually have plastics for really, really important reasons. And they, again, keep us from getting sick, keep disease from propagating and making sure that we can deliver health care in an efficient way. The same is in the built environment. And we've looked at the construction industry. You know, we used to be using lead pipes and now we're not using lead pipes anymore. We're predominately using really robust plastic types. And so the plastic universe is very intertwined. And that doesn't mean that we're not supposed to be thinking about how to make it more sustainable. But we depend on these materials and these materials are often the lowest footprint option to deliver whatever function we need them to deliver. So in the hunt to find a sustainable alternative, what does that kind of sustainable plastic landscape look like currently? What's the kind of current trajectory of what we think could come in to replace it? Yeah, I think the first thing we have to sort of address is that there are no panaceas. There's no silver bullet that we can go, OK, let's just do this, right? Because of the diversity of plastic functions and the role that they play, we really need to be able to have lots of different solutions that are going to work. And I'll give you an example back to the grocery store. So if I look at plastic wrap that might be over different food products. So that plastic wrap, again, is there for a reason. But if I look at the plastic wrap that is around meat, for instance, well, it's really important that that plastic wrap is impervious to oxygen because if oxygen gets into the package, then the meat will spoil. Yeah. But equally, if I were to take a courgette, that courgette, right, if that's packaged up, it has to be able to release moisture. It has to be able to be permeable, that same plastic wrap. And so the public might go and look at that and say, well, we have two wraps that look the same. But actually, they're very complex materials that have unique functions and we have to make sure that they are fit for purpose. So the first thing for any alternative is we have to make sure that it delivers the same function, right? And so that it can still perform what we needed to perform. The second thing we need to do is to make sure that the that this is not a solution that exacerbates another problem, right? So the law of unintended consequences to make sure that those materials are produced themselves in an efficient way and that they themselves are sustainable. And then the third thing is to really consider, and this is where a lot of our work sits, to really consider a multitude of different fates. And so how do we have a system in which we can incorporate lots of different things, right? And so some of those plastic items should be reused, right? Some of those plastic items should be recycled. Some of those plastic items maybe would be degraded or perhaps deconstructed in some way. But actually, it's about getting a system in place where all of those different potential fates can work in concert with each other to get a sustainable outcome. So rather than one kind of sustainable plastic, it's more of a new sustainable system. And that systems approach is really important across lots of different aspects of sustainability from our food system to our packaging system to our transportation system, that all of these options really don't work unless there is a system to enable whatever it is we imagine is going to happen to them. So going back to the Halloween sweets that I mentioned before, we're starting to see more products with packaging that's either recyclable or made from recycled materials or buy it agroedible, which I'm sure it certainly does for me influences your shopping habits and what you decide to buy. So in all these cases where there's kind of a sustainability branding, what does that process actually look like? And is it accurate that that is what's happening to the materials? I think that there is a lot of good work being done in the UK to provide a bit more authenticity around what those words mean. But the challenge is that it takes time to embed those processes. So we have a number of legislative measures in the UK, so stuff like the plastic packaging tax, which is mandating 30% recycled content in our packages to the upcoming extended producer responsibility legislation. And the challenge with legislation, however, is that it really lacks the nuance to address those differences and sort of integrate into a system. And that leads to a little bit of a Wild West approach where something can make a claim and it's not really clear how that's realized. And a good example of that is recyclable. So recyclable doesn't necessarily mean that that is recycled. And for some, I guess, actors in this space, those actors might be making a claim that something which is incinerated or incinerated for energy, perhaps, that that should be considered recyclable. And when you have a lot of vested interest, it leads to public perception of what those words mean, not matching the reality. And the same thing is true with recycled content. And so from our work, we can show that, you know, by far the best sustainable outcome. So if you have a product, the best thing for you to do is to increase the recycled content in that package. But that actually is technically very difficult to do because of the same variability that we talked about. So you had mentioned the Halloween candy, right? And so when you have Halloween candy or when you have Christmas, you know, quality street tins suddenly have a change in the composition of the waste. And so if that's going to the recycling industry, then suddenly the composition of their recyclet, which is what we've really called the material that's coming out, that we want to include back into the packaging ecosystem also changes. So we have seasonal changes. We have changes based on geography. We have changes based on media stories, which perhaps are giving the wrong messaging. And that creates this really complicated ecosystem because the companies that are trying to include recycled content, they might have a variable quality, right? And then they don't know that they can include this material with confidence. That leads to a lowering of trust, both with the public, because they don't believe the words that are said on the package and a lowering of trust in the industry people, the brand owners who are trying to incorporate that. And really that then comes back to some fundamental science. How do we go and develop the quality control tools that we need to be able to provide that authenticity, both to industry that wants to do the right things and public that wants to do the right things. And public that wants to do the right thing in terms of purchasing. And they want to know that the decisions that they're making are the most sustainable ones they can. I think it's so common that these issues come up and people, you know, in the general public don't have time to go and research. What process was behind the quality street wrapping changing from the kind of foil to the papery packaging, which I think was in the last couple of years. I wouldn't have time to go and for myself make the decision of whether or not that was actually an accurate sustainable change. So I think that trust in the organisations that are doing it is so crucial because people rely on it from a time constraint. And I think that that that the UK has been really progressive in pushing for that. The challenge is that it takes time. I mean, we have thousands and thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of products within the UK, that even if we just consider the packaging industry, that's a lot of change. And that change has to exist in an international ecosystem, not just with the EU in a legislative sense, but also also with the fact that we import and export so many different things from so many different countries. So talking about this kind of trust in organisations, labelling things as sustainable, that all kind of falls under a broad title of greenwashing. And on the topic of greenwashing, there was an example you used in a previous talk, which I really wanted to ask you about. And that was the Mastercard story. Could you kind of tell us about what happened there? Well, so just so that Mastercard doesn't get me in trouble, I think it's really important to highlight that there are two kinds of greenwashing. Right? There's greenwashing, which is really purposeful. And when an organisation knows that what they're saying doesn't match the reality, I think that that's a real problem. And that requires an intervention. But oftentimes, organisations that we work with, they really don't know what the most sustainable option is. And they're trying really hard. But if they don't have the information that they need, then they could go and say something, which then afterwards they're going to get accused of greenwashing. And I think this is the case with the Mastercard example, where one of their leaders got up and said, oh, this is the world's first biodegradable credit card. Well, you can imagine a credit card, right? We all have them in our pockets. And when that degraded, right, in the environment, well, what would it do? It would release the barium from the magnetic strip, it would release the 18 metals that are in the chipset, all into the environment. I mean, it's an ecological disaster waiting to happen. It's not ideal. But, well, what do they do about it? Right? They made an error in terms of, well, not understanding the unintended consequences. And they then came to us and asked us, well, what would a sustainable card look like? And the reality is, is those same metals, those same elements that are in that credit card are actually really valuable. And so you can actually go and redesign your card and say, OK, we're going to build that around deconstruction. We wouldn't be able to recycle that in the same sense, because again, all of those different materials would get mixed into the recycling and lead to an exceptionally bad product. And we did try that once or twice just for fun. But what actually that allows you to do is to then do what we call a de-plimerization, but really a deconstruction of that card back down to the original chemical units. And so we extract that chemical value from the system. But when we strip that away, actually what that offers is you can isolate the different metals that are in the chipset. We even did it once or twice where we recovered the chips. I can say with assurance that, no, nobody can get your data from those chips. No one's bank account was hacked. And I think that that really shows that you can go and create economic value by thinking about something as simple as a card. Now, what was really interesting, if I go into this a little bit further, is when you then think about the social context of that. Well, what am I really talking about? I'm talking about going and getting someone's credit card and then de-plimerizing that back. But everybody, and I'm sure you do it as well, not only do when you're done with a credit card, do you cut it up probably into six pieces. You then take three of those pieces and put them into one bin in your house. And three of those pieces somewhere else because somehow that is going to foil the economic masterminds who are going to go and steal your data. And I think that's the challenge is if we can't recover that material, then we have to be really conscious, right? That we're not greenwashing ourselves in the sustainable solutions that we devise. If we can't get that security of material supply, then we're never going to be able to de-plimerize those cards. And so where we're looking at that now is actually a very different space of the master card. And that's in hotels. Because of what you do is you check into a hotel, you've got your card, you beep it into your room, and then what do you do afterwards? You give it back. And now you have an ability to go and have a secure supply of those cards and people don't care because there is no information on it. But they still have the same elements that are on the inside, which can be valuable to those systems. And that's very much about showing that technology has to be developed for the right reasons, has to be developed with purpose, and then developed in concert with stakeholders from across the value chain to get something off the ground. I guess some of it also, particularly in the credit card example rather than the hotel card, is kind of ease of consumer, right? Because if you devise a process that's really reliant on someone doing something that takes a lot of their time and they need to go out of their way to go to this separate recycling point or something like that, then it's not going to be as successful as you want it to be. So is that a factor that also comes in when you're kind of devising these things? Hugely. And I think that this is especially true when you look at waste management systems as they exist when you're outside the home, right? And so as soon as you're on the high street, well, you know, do you really want to go and take all of your packaging and then bring it back home and then separate it into the different components? It creates a real logistical challenge. And a lot of the work we do is trying to make sure that the system is adaptable to the most common social practices rather than expecting behavior change. Because I think the valueless nature, like plastics are very much invisible to us. And that invisibility means that we're not thinking about them. And then to expect us to think about them and to change behavior is really, really challenging. It means that the behavior changes won't stick. And so building the system to adapt to behavior. So using behavioral understanding rather than expecting behavior change. So talking about kind of how people recycle, your kind of research project focusing on this is called One Bin to Rule Them All. What is this project looking at specifically? Yeah, so One Bin to Rule Them All started as a joke with some of our industry partners and now is probably going to end up on my gravestone. But the reality is that it's basically saying, you know, if the challenge is to secure supply, what will people do if you give them a bin and say, put everything that you think in plastic that is plastic into that bin? And then layered over that are three framings or three ways to look at the plastic that might come through those bins. So that's a social science aspect. So qualitative social science, interviewing the households who participated in our trial. That's a material understanding. So understanding not only the nature of the materials which could get put in there, but importantly, the contamination and then the economic opportunities which might be created from those material flows. And I think that this is probably the first time that those three things were looked at together in concert with each other. And lots of times people look at these challenges from a disciplinary bias, but to do something from a genuinely interdisciplinary space leads to very different decisions. And I'll give you just one example of that. So if we were to think about flexibles recycling, right? And so this has been a very hot topic. You know, you probably will have gone to a UK grocery store and seen the bins that you can shove your growth's flexibles inside. Yeah. And when we looked at social practice on this, what was really clear is that everybody took a flexible, shoved all of their other flexibles inside that flexible and then tied a knot in that flexible. Now, if you were to go to a modern material recovery facility or a plastic recovery facility, you would see that actually the way that the sorting works is that sorts based on whether or not this is a 2D material, so a two dimensional material like a flexible sheet or a 3D material. But what everybody did from social practice is to transform their 2D materials into a 3D material. Right. And so now we have a consequence on our imagined sorting system. And so we actually really have to think critically about making those sorting decisions. And the reality is, is that's very much how our project works. What are the sorting decisions that we could make? What are the sorting decisions that we should make? How should we make those? And where is the economic value hidden in those streams? Well, that needs to be informed by social practice. We can't go and say, oh, OK, everybody else do something. Do what we tell you to do, right? Because we know I'm originally from Canada. But in the UK, man, consumers are willful, right? Everybody wants to do their own thing. And actually the system has to adopt to that diversity of practice. And that system then has to make decisions based on that diversity of practice. So you can define different technologies or different solutions that work in concert with each other to create that sustainable system if you actually understand the behaviors that are going into that one bin to rule them all. So one of the behaviors that you looked at in this research was kind of looking through people's rubbish. Very gross. And I know there's at least every other day in my kitchen, there's a debate about, is this recyclable? Can I put that in the recycling or can I not? Oh, I'm not sure. So maybe we shouldn't because we don't want to risk it. What did you learn about how people recycle? So we had different household studies which were based across what are called the Indices of Deprivation. And that sounds very grand and also sort of mean. But like it means across different socioeconomic demographics. I think what was firstly really interesting is that there was a great appetite to do the right thing as long as that right thing was simple. And actually, as soon as that became more complicated, then people would get confused. And so the types of contamination would change, but the appetite to do the right thing did not change. And so there is a huge amount of potential material that could be available. But what we need is consistency, right? And that consistency comes from legislation. And so a lot of our recommendations, I guess, from a policy standpoint, were fed into what became the simpler recycling policy. And that policy is not perfect. But I think with an increased consistency and with an obligation on the people who are putting the packaging on the market to choose packages which are going to be recycled, you can really get to a space where the volume of plastic increases, the quality of plastic that's coming through the waste management system increases. And that's the economic tipping point that really goes and ensures that this happens on a much grander scale. And so the opportunity is there. It's just really with us taking it. What would your forward look goal be for this kind of almighty singular bin scenario? What would you say, kind of five, ten years down the line? What would be your ideal kind of outcome? Well, I'm, oh, gosh. Not to put you on the spot. What I would say, so what we call rigids, right? And so you can think of that like your milk jug or your plastic tray. Rigids, if they are clean and if they are segregated really well, they offer really good value. You can mechanically recycle them. It works very well. In our lab, we've done this hundreds of times. In the real world, you can't do that hundreds of times because there's the laws of physics you're competing against. But in that scenario, ridges are really recyclable. And so focusing mechanical recycling capacity, and so that is very much what the norm is now, I think can really take the bulk of those rigids and make them into valuable products. Those valuable products don't necessarily need to be in the same sector, right? And so it's a bit naive to say that the circular economy, if you've heard that phrase, is like, oh, we should take a yogurt pot and turn it into a yogurt pot. Why do we not see value in taking a yogurt pot and turning it into a car? Sure. Right? If you wanted, if I could give you one of two things, a yogurt pot or a car, you probably would take the car, right? The car holds a lot of value. Yeah, I lean towards it. And I think that that's the key is really opening up what we consider to be valuable and keeping those materials in its highest value condition. So reusing the things that we can reuse, transitioning those into recycling, potentially putting those in different sectors, and then ensuring that we are underpinning that with really good quality data that allow us to make those sustainable decisions. And so a lot more openness and transparency in terms of everything from the composition of materials to how they flow through our lives is key to allow us to make better decisions and a system in which really no plastic is released into the environment. What we have to do is to move away from an extraction focused economy, but we know that we have to keep using plastics. And so keeping them in the system for as long as possible is key. So for those listening who would like to get a car, are there any other kind of, obviously a lot of the change that needs to happen is at a much higher level and a kind of government need to implement certain things. But for people at home in their day to day lives, are there any kind of common misconceptions of things you can't, if you think you can recycle them, but you can't, or anything you can advise people that they could feel like they're kind of making a bit of a difference? I think that underneath all of this is if we're going to move away from an extractive world, we have to really buy things that are valuable. And so buying things which you want and which you need, which you can keep in your life for a long period of time is key. And so what we want to avoid is the reactive, oh, okay, I'm going to buy a soft drink in a bottle because I feel thirsty now and I've forgotten my refillable water bottle at home. I'm going to hope for the best, maybe check my recycled, my recyclable bottle into the bin. I've not looked at the package to see whether it has recycled content, but in the UK we do that very well. And then somehow that gets turned into a sweater that I buy off of some low-quality website and I wear it twice and then it falls apart. And I think that we really have to buy smarter. And that means that we're looking for, so the things that are sustainable now are items which have more recycled content in terms of packaging, items which you're going to keep and use for a long time. So something which is repairable or you're going to be able to reuse numerous times and avoiding those buy and throw away reactive purchases just because they provide you with a little bit of dopamine. So short answer, impulse control will help. So I know we keep linking back to Halloween, but I think we've spoken a lot about Halloween candy. And another thing that people might differently associate with Halloween is drinking. I'm going somewhere with this, I promise. I know your team have looked specifically at sustainability in the beer industry. What does that entail? So essentially one of the, so in Manchester we run what's called the Sustainable Materials Innovation Hub. And one of the first projects we did was to basically unpick what is the most sustainable way to package up your beer. And Manchester is home to just a plethora of absolutely fantastic brewers. And we host the Ditsbury Beer Festival where you can go and try all kinds of different ones. But I think within that framing it's like you have all of these different options for how to transport that beer. So you could have it in keg. And that keg could be made out of metal or made out of plastic. You could have it in cask. And most of those casks are metal now, although there's some movement in the industry. Or you could then package it up in individual things. So you could have it in a bottle, a glass bottle, or a aluminium can. And each one of those has sort of a different sustainability footprint. And we were really surprised because if you think about it, well you've got to go and transport that beer from the brewery to wherever. And the idea of putting that in something metal and heavy, well that actually has a huge influence on the carbon footprint of those processes. And so keeping that low, actually the most sustainable option which we looked at was using a plastic keg. And there's different brands for those and I'm not going to market those brands. But that is a decision that the brewing industry moved towards. Not because they had a sustainability setup, but because it was less expensive. They were using less petrol to move everything around. And so because they were paying for weight in terms of transportation, they switched away from glass to aluminium cans. And they switched away from big metal kegs for the most part to the plastic kegs. And that made their industry more sustainable. But they did it for an economic reason. And I think the really interesting space we're in right now is when we can tether an environmental outcome to an economic outcome, then everybody wins. And it's getting industry to really realise that that opportunity is present now and that they should take advantage of it. There's kind of a misconception that the more eco-friendly way of doing something is more expensive. But that certainly doesn't seem the case in that example. And there are many options where it is still really challenging to be eco-friendly. But that doesn't mean that there aren't opportunities. And often getting a business to reframe their thinking, identifying quick wins for them, which have that economic and environmental tether, that's the beginning of a journey for them. Because sustainability is never absolute. It's always a journey. It's always relative. And it's really about moving along that space and each year being a little bit more sustainable than the year before. There was a kind of pop-up by Uber a couple of weeks ago in London and they put up their first carbon negative pub. And I didn't go because I only found out about it after it happened. But from what I can understand, they basically got people to kind of pedal on bikes whilst drinking, which then powered the electricity of the pub. And they had other things going on that I think became a carbon deficit. So it was kind of overall carbon negative. Is that something you kind of see being more common going forward? Or do you think it's just a case of the kind of changes that you've mentioned with transportation and things like that just need to be implemented at first rather than making a cycling pub? Yeah, so first things first, I think we should make it very clear that these were stationary bikes and we're not at all recommending that people should cycle around London. And cycle. Yeah, don't drink and drive even under your own power. But I think what's really interesting there is it's a little bit of a gimmick, right? Because you know, that might be true that the operational costs. So we call those sort of the emissions that are associated with operating. But of course, what you have then is the embodied carbon and whatever those cycles were. And it's actually a huge footprint. So how long would they have to have driven those cycles around to recover the carbon that's associated with the production of those bicycles in the first place? Yeah, I think it was a two day pop up. Yeah, a lot longer than two days. There probably needs to be the Uber CEO needs to still be down there cycling away. But I think what those events do do is to bring a community together to start talking about sustainability. And even if that is a little bit gimmicky, if it brings sustainability up in discourse, up in sort of the narrative around which we how we purchase what we decide to do, that I think is important. And so even with a little bit of greenwashing of that, it still is a really good event because it's framed around sustainability and it gets people to think. I think it's also a case of instead of the narrative of making your lifestyle more sustainable means it needs to be worse, instead of being like you can still do this thing that you normally do. And it's a little bit like weird and quirky and fun. So instead of losing something in your life in order to be more sustainable, you're kind of gaining a bit of a different experience and not having to not go to the pub anymore. Yeah, no. And I think you're also sort of choosing your you choose you choose your vice as well. Right. And so, you know, the going out to the pub having a pint without purpose, I think is when you have the option to go out and do something with purpose. And that could be as simple as I'm connecting with people and I'm building up a social currency that is important and considering that we are all in this ecosystem together. I think all of those things are really key, but we should be thoughtful about our consumption and we should consider sustainability, economic, environmental and social sustainability and how we live our lives. I have a final Halloween link back and a final question for you. And this can be with a sustainability viewpoint or not. In preparation for tomorrow, do you have a Halloween costume planned or do you kind of have one on the back burner that's a good safe bet? So what I would say is that the most important decision that you have to make in the Halloween costume space is the same as we've been talking about with the rest of this in that you want something which is going to last. So something which is meaningful to you, but that you can reuse. And I find the best thing to do is to go to a thrift shop, figure out something that somebody has already loved and build the costume from there, but build it in such a way that you can reuse it again and again and again. And if anybody asks you why you're wearing the same costume as last year, well you can say you're trying to save the world. Also it's a good costume, so why not? And it's a good costume, right? So I think that's the key, reuse and buy something which has been discarded by someone else. On that note, thanks so much Mike and good luck in your talk. Yeah, thank you very much. Thanks for having me. That's all for this month. Thanks for listening. Make sure to keep an eye on our YouTube channel for Mike's full public program talk.
