i am a father of three and my kid are all in different stage of their education .
my oldest is in high school my middle child is in middle school and my youngest is starting elementary school .

thats great michael .

yes definitely .
we are looking forward to hearing your perspective especially since youve had to support your child at many different stage of their education .
and i know that many of our listener are parent who are also trying to figure out the best way to help their child succeed in school .
and i think one of the most important thing for parent to remember is that they do not have to be expert to make a difference .
sometimes being there and showing that you care can have a huge impact on a child motivation and confidence .
thats such an important point michael .
i think a lot of parent worry that they do not know enough to help their child with their schoolwork especially if they are busy or if they did not have the same opportunity when they were growing up .
but you said being involved and showing interest can make a big difference .
yes and thats exactly what we want to focus on today .
practical way that any parent can support their child education no matter their background or circumstance .
well be talking about how to create a positive learning environment at home how to communicate effectively with teacher and how to encourage and motivate child to do their best .
and of course well be hearing from michael about his own experience and the lesson he learned along the way .
well also have a qa session later in the podcast where well answer some question from our listener about this topic .

and do not forget if you have any question or comment during the podcast you can reach out to u on our social medium channel .
we love hearing from our listener and getting your feedback .
now let get started with our discussion on the role of parent in supporting childrens education .
weve got a lot to cover let dive in .
julia before we get into the main discussion i thought it would be nice for u to share a little bit about our own experience with education .
i think it is always interesting to hear how different people were supported by their parent when they were growing up .
what do you think ?
i think thats a great idea adam .
after all everyones educational journey is unique and it can shape who we become .
for me education wa always a big focus in my family .
my parent were very involved but in different way .
my mom wa always the one helping me with my homework .
she would sit with me at the kitchen table and wed go over my assignment together .
she wasnt a teacher but she always encouraged me to try my best and made sure i had everything i needed to succeed .
that sound wonderful julia .
it is amazing how much of a difference that support can make .
my experience wa a bit different .
my parent were both very busy with work they did not have a much time to help me with my schoolwork directly .
but they always made it clear that education wa important .
they set high expectation and they were always there to celebrate my success .
even though they couldnt always be there physically their support wa always felt .
they made sure i knew that doing in school wa my job and they were proud of me when i worked hard .
thats important adam .
i think a lot of parent feel they need to be sitting down with their child every night to help with homework but thats not always possible .
what matter is the message that parent send about education .
whether it is through helping with homework setting expectation or being there to encourage and motivate parent play a huge role in shaping their childrens attitude toward learning .
and i think thats something we can all relate to no matter where we come from .
parental involvement doesnt have to be about doing the work for your child .
it is about being a source of support and encouragement .
it is about creating an environment where learning is valued and where child feel confident to take on challenge and ask for help when they need it .
yes and that brings u to the bigger picture of why parental involvement is crucial .
study have shown that when parent are involved in their childrens education those child tend to do better in school .
they have higher grade better attendance and they are more likely to continue their education beyond high school .
it is not about helping with homework .
it is about being engaged in their overall learning process .
when parent show an interest in their childrens education it sends a powerful message that education is important and that can be incredibly motivating for child .
it help them see that what they are doing in school matter not to them but to their family a . and it is not about academic success either .
parental involvement can also help child develop better social skill and selfesteem .
when child know that their parent are there to support them they are more likely to take on new challenge and to keep trying even when thing get tough .
it give them the confidence to push through obstacle because they know they are not alone .
thats such an important point julia .
education is not about getting good grade .
it is about developing the skill and confidence to succeed in life and parent have a huge role to play in that .
by being involved they are helping to build a foundation for their childrens future success not in school but in everything they do .
exactly adam and thats why we wanted to talk about this topic today .
whether you are a parent a teacher or even a student it is important to understand the impact that parental involvement can have .
it is something that can make a real difference in a child life and it is something that we can all work to improve no matter our circumstance .
yes and thats what we are going to explore in more detail today .
well be talking about specific way that parent can get involved no matter how busy they are or what their background is .
we want to provide practical tip and advice that anyone can use to support their child education .
and with michael here to share his experience we are going to get some valuable insight that i think our listener will find helpful .
whether you are a parent looking for new way to support your child or someone interested in the topic stay tuned .
weve got a lot of great information coming your way .
we are getting started and we have much to cover .
let dive into our first key point how parent can create a positive learning environment at home .
now that weve set the stage it is time to dive into our main discussion .
in this section well be talking about three key way parent can support their childrens education creating a positive learning environment communicating with teacher and encouraging and motivating child .
let get started with our first key point creating a positive learning environment .
one of the most important thing parent can do to support their child education is to create a positive learning environment at home .
a child learning environment ha a huge impact on their ability to focus stay organized and feel motivated to do their best .
but what exactly doe a positive learning environment look ?
and how can parent create one ?
for starter it is important to have a designated study space for your child .
this doesnt mean you need to have a whole room dedicated to studying but there should be a specific area where your child know they can go to focus on their schoolwork .
this space should be quiet free from distraction and organized .
when a child ha a clean calm place to work it help them concentrate and signal to them that this is a place where learning happens .
thats a great point adam .
i know that when i wa a student having a specific spot where i could sit down and focus made all the difference .
but i also think it is important to make the learning environment not functional but also engaging .
after all learning shouldnt feel a chore .
parent can do simple thing to make learning at home more fun and interesting for their child .
for example you could incorporate your child interest into their study space .
if they love drawing have some art supply nearby that they can use during break .
if they are into science you could decorate the area with poster or book about their favorite scientific topic .
making the space inviting and relevant to your child interest can help make study time something they look forward to rather than something they dread .
thats such a good idea julia .
and it emphasizes the fact that a positive learning environment is about more than physical space .
it is also about creating an atmosphere that encourages curiosity and a love for learning .
michael youve been through this with your own kid .
how have you gone about setting up a good learning environment at home ?
adam and julia ive found that creating a positive learning environment is about finding what work best for each individual child .
with my three kid i quickly learned that what work for one doesnt necessarily work for the others .
my oldest for example need complete silence when shes studying .
we set up a quiet corner in her room with a desk a comfortable chair and a lamp with adjustable lighting .
we made sure it wa a place where she could shut the door and focus without interruption .
my middle child on the other hand like a bit of background noise when he study .
he often doe his homework at the dining room table where he can still hear whats going on around the house .
for him the key wa having a big open space where he could spread out his material .
we also keep a basket of school supply on the table he ha everything he need within reach .
and for my youngest who starting elementary school weve set up a little learning nook in the living room .
it is cozy with a small desk and some shelf where we keep book and educational game .
she love having a space that feel her own but where we can still keep an eye on her and step in to help when she need it .
thats insightful michael .
it sound youve put a lot of thought into creating space that suit each of your childrens need .
and i think thats such an important takeaway for our listener .
there no one size fit all solution when it come to creating a positive learning environment .
it is all about paying attention to what your child need to be able to focus and feel comfortable .
yes and i love how youve managed to make those space not only functional but also personalized to each of your child .
it go to show that even small change can have a big impact on how a child feel about studying .
when kid have a space that they enjoy it can make all the difference in their attitude toward their schoolwork .
and i think one of the most important thing is to involve your child in setting up their study space .
ask them what they need what make them feel comfortable and what they would to have in their space .
when kid have a say in creating their learning environment they are more likely to take ownership of their study time and stay motivated .
thats a great tip michael .
and it is a perfect segue into our next key point communication between parent and teacher .
setting up a good learning environment at home is important but it is one part of the puzzle .
staying informed about whats happening at school and working together with teacher is crucial for a child success .
exactly adam .
communication between parent and teacher is important and it is something that can make a difference in a child education .
when parent and teacher are on the same page it help to ensure that child are getting the support they need both at school and at home .
but i know that for some parent especially those who are new to the school system or who may not speak english a their first language reaching out to teacher can feel a bit intimidating .
one of the most important thing to remember is that teacher are there to help .
they want to see your child succeed a much a you do and they are usually very willing to communicate with parent .
it doesnt have to be a formal meeting every time .
you can start by sending a simple email or making a quick phone call to check in on your child progress .
and it doesnt take much to stay informed .
for example many school now have online portal where parent can log in and see their child grade assignment and any comment from teacher .
this can be a great way to keep track of how your child is doing without having to wait for report card or parentteacher conference .
but of course nothing beat direct communication .
setting up regular meeting with your child teacher even if it is once or twice a year can help you understand what your child is learning and where they might need extra support .
it also give you the opportunity to ask question and share any concern you might have .
and another important aspect of communication is sharing information with teacher about your child learning style interest or any challenge they might be facing .
teacher often have many student and while they do their best to get to know each child they can benefit from parent insight .
if your child is struggling with a particular subject or if there something going on at home that might be affecting their schoolwork letting the teacher know can help them provide the support .
i completely agree julia .
in my experience being open and communicative with teacher ha made a big difference for my kid .
for example my middle child wa having some trouble with math a few year ago .
i made sure to speak with his teacher about it and she wa able to recommend some extra resource and strategy that we could use at home .
we also set up a system where i would check in with her every few week to see how he wa progressing .
it wasnt a big time commitment but it made a world of difference for him .
and it is not about addressing problem .
regular communication can also help reinforce what your child is doing .
when teacher know that you are interested and involved they can share positive feedback with you that you can then pas on to your child .
it creates a positive cycle of encouragement that can boost a child confidence and motivation .
thats such a good point michael .
positive communication between parent and teacher doesnt help with addressing challenge .
it also help celebrate success .
and when child see that their parent and teacher are working together it sends a strong message that their education is important and valued .
yes and i think it is also important to remember that communication doesnt have to be all about academic .
teacher can offer insight into other aspect of your child development their social skill behavior and overall being .
by staying in touch with teacher parent can get a more complete picture of how their child is doing in school and can provide better support at home .
and for parent who might feel hesitant about reaching out to teacher i would say do not be afraid to start the conversation .
teacher appreciate when parent are involved and even a small effort to communicate can have a big impact on your child education .
it doesnt have to be perfect and it doesnt have to be formal .
what matter most is that you are showing an interest in your child learning .
i couldnt agree more michael .
communication is key and it is something that can help parent teacher and student work together a a team .
now let move on to our third key point encouraging and motivating child .
this is where parent can make a difference in their child academic success .
encouragement is such a powerful tool when it come to helping child succeed in school .
a parent you have the ability to shape how your child feel about learning and education .
when child feel supported and encouraged they are more likely to stay motivated even when the work get challenging .
one of the simplest way to encourage your child is by showing interest in their schoolwork .
ask them about what they are learning what they find interesting and what they might be struggling with .
even sitting down with them while they do their homework can show that you are invested in their education .
it is all about being present and showing that you care .
thats true adam .
and it is not about praising them when they get good grade or do something .
it is also about recognizing their effort even if the result are not perfect .
for example if your child is working hard on a difficult math problem but doesnt quite get the answer you can still praise them for trying and encourage them to keep at it .
it is important to let child know that making mistake is a part of learning and that their effort are valued .
exactly julia .
encouragement shouldnt be about the end result .
it should also be about the process .
when child know that their hard work is noticed and appreciated they are more likely to develop a growth mindset .
this mean theyll be more willing to take on challenge and learn from their mistake rather than feeling discouraged when thing do not go perfectly .
i can definitely relate to that adam .
in my experience one of the best way to motivate child is to focus on the effort they put in rather than the outcome .
for instance my youngest wa struggling with reading at the beginning of the school year .
she would get frustrated and start to avoid reading altogether .
but instead of focusing on whether she got the word we started celebrating every time she sat down to practice even if it wa for a few minute .
wed make a big deal out of the fact that she wa trying and gradually her confidence started to grow .
we also found way to make reading more enjoyable for her .
we let her choose book that interested her and sometimes wed read together a a family .
by making it a positive experience and showing her that we were proud of her effort she started to improve .
and most importantly she began to enjoy reading again .
thats such a great approach michael .
it highlight the importance of making learning a positive experience for child .
when they feel good about what they are doing they are much more likely to stay motivated .
and i love the idea of making learning a family activity .
it show child that education is valued and that it is something everyone in the family is involved in .
and i think thats key julia .
when parent are involved and show that they value education it sends a powerful message to their child .
it is not about telling them that school is important .
it is about showing them through your action whether it is setting aside time to help with homework attending school event or simply asking about their day .
these small action can have a big impact on how child perceive their education .
absolutely adam .
and ive also found that setting goal together can be a great way to keep child motivated .
whether it is finishing a book improving in a particular subject or even something simple completing their homework on time setting small achievable goal give child something to work toward .
and when they reach those goal it is important to celebrate their achievement no matter how small they might seem .
this reinforces the idea that their hard work pay off and encourages them to keep striving for success .
thats a wonderful idea michael .
setting goal can help child stay focused and motivated and celebrating their success big or small help build their confidence and encourages them to keep pushing themselves .
it is all about creating a positive cycle of effort and reward .
and i think another important aspect of motivation is helping child see the value in what they are learning .
sometimes especially with subject they find difficult child might feel what they are learning doesnt matter .
but a parent you can help connect their schoolwork to reallife situation or their own interest .
for example if your child love playing video game you could talk about how math is used in game design .
or if they are into sport you could discus how science play a role in understanding how the body work .
thats a great point adam when child can see the relevance of what they are learning it becomes more meaningful to them .
it help them understand that what they are doing in school ha realworld application and is not something they have to do because they are told to .
and when they see the value in their education they are more likely to stay engaged and motivated .
exactly michael .
and i think it is also important to remind child that it is to ask for help when they are struggling .
sometimes child might feel they have to do everything on their own but thats not the case .
whether it is asking a teacher for extra help working with a tutor or even talking thing through with a parent .
it is important for child to know that it is to seek support when they need it .
encouraging them to ask question and seek help can boost their confidence and help them overcome challenge more effectively .
thats such an important point julia .
asking for help is a strength not a weakness .
and a parent it is our job to let our child know that it is to reach out when they are facing difficulty .
whether it is academic or emotional support being there for our child and helping them navigate challenge is one of the most important thing we can do to support their education .
and at the end of the day i think the most important thing is to let our child know that we believe in them .
when child know that their parent are in their corner cheering them on and supporting them every step of the way it give them the confidence to keep going even when thing get tough .
thats a wonderful note to end on michael .
encouraging and motivating our child creating positive learning environment and maintaining open communication with teacher .
these are all essential way parent can support their child education .
by being involved showing interest and providing support parent can make a huge difference in their child academic success .
and i hope our listener have found today discussion helpful and inspiring .
remember supporting your child education doesnt have to be complicated .
it is about the little thing being present showing interest and encouraging them to do their best .
and with that id to thank michael for joining u today and sharing his valuable insight .
it is been a pleasure to talk about such an important topic .
thank you michael .
and to all our listener thank you for tuning in .
we hope youll join u again next time a we continue to explore way to support and enhance your child learning journey .
until then keep supporting your child keep communicating with their teacher and most importantly keep encouraging them to reach for their dream .
now let dive deeper into today topic by hearing from our special guest michael .
michael youve been involved in your childrens education for many year and i am sure you have some valuable insight to share with our listener .
could you start by telling u about a personal experience where your involvement in your child education made a real difference ?
thank you for having me on the podcast today .
i am passionate about this topic because ive seen firsthand how much of an impact parent can have on their childrens education .
id to share a story thats very close to my heart .
this story is about my eldest daughter emma .
when emma wa in the fourth grade she started struggling with math .
it wasnt that she wasnt capable she had a hard time grasping some of the concept .
at first she would come home frustrated saying that math wa too hard and that she did not understand what the teacher wa explaining .
a a parent it wa tough to see her upset and feeling she wa falling behind .
i realized that if i did not step in to help emma might start to lose confidence in herself and her ability .
i began by talking to her teacher to better understand what emma wa struggling with .
the teacher wa very helpful and suggested some resource that we could use at home .
after that we set up a dedicated study time for math each evening .
it wasnt always easy and there were time when emma would get frustrated or want to give up .
but i made sure to be patient and positive .
we worked on the problem together and i tried to make it a fun a possible by turning it into a game or using reallife example that she could relate to .
over time i started to see a change in emma .
she began to approach math with a little more confidence and the concept that once seemed impossible started to make sense to her .
by the end of the school year emma not only improved her math grade but also gained a new sense of selfbelief .
she realized that with hard work and the support she could overcome challenge and thats a lesson that ha stayed with her ever since .
looking back i am glad i took the time to get involved .
it wasnt about improving her math skill it wa about showing her that she wasnt alone and that she had someone in her corner cheering her on .
that experience strengthened our relationship and gave her the confidence to tackle other challenge in the year to come .
thats such an inspiring story michael .
it highlight the difference that parental involvement can make in a child education .
your patience encouragement and willingness to work alongside emma clearly made a huge impact on her confidence and academic success .
and whats important to note here is that it wasnt about helping with homework .
it wa about being present being supportive and creating a positive learning environment where emma felt safe to make mistake and learn from them .
michael i am sure there are many parent listening who want to be a supportive a you were with emma .
what practical advice would you give to parent who want to support their childrens education ?
i think the most important piece of advice i can give is to be present and engaged .
you do not have to be an expert in every subject or spend hour helping with homework but showing interest in your child education can make a world of difference .
here are a few practical tip that ive found to be effective .
one communicate regularly with teacher .
one of the best way to stay informed about your child progress is to maintain open line of communication with their teacher .
do not wait for parentteacher conference .
reach out periodically to ask how your child is doing what they are excelling in and where they might need extra help .
teacher can offer valuable insight and suggestion that you can use to support your child at home .
two create a positive learning environment at home .
a i mentioned earlier setting up a dedicated study space can help your child focus and feel more organized .
this doesnt have to be a big fancy room a quiet lit area with all the supply they need .
make sure it is a space where they feel comfortable and free from distraction .
additionally try to establish a routine for homework and study time .
having a consistent schedule can help child develop good study habit .
three be a role model .
child learn a lot by observing the adult around them .
if they see that you value education and lifelong learning they are more likely to adopt those same attitude .
this doesnt mean you have to go back to school yourself but showing curiosity reading book and talking about what you are learning can inspire your child to do the same .
four encourage a growth mindset .
it is important to teach your child that intelligence and ability can be developed through effort and perseverance .
praise them for their hard work not their grade and help them see mistake a opportunity to learn and grow .
when child understand that they can improve through effort they are more likely to embrace challenge and keep trying even when thing get tough .
five stay positive and patient .
there will be time when your child get frustrated or feel overwhelmed and it is important to stay positive and patient during these moment .
listen to their concern offer reassurance and help them break down task into smaller manageable step .
remind them that it is to struggle sometimes .
what matter is that they keep trying and do not give up .
six be involved but not overbearing .
while it is important to be involved in your child education it is equally important to give them space to learn and grow independently .
encourage them to take responsibility for their own learning and problemsolving but let them know that you are there to support them when needed .
finding the balance between being involved and giving them autonomy can help them develop confidence and selfdiscipline .
seven celebrate achievement big and small .
finally take the time to celebrate your child achievement no matter how small they may seem .
whether it is completing a challenging assignment improving in a subject or simply sticking to their study routine recognizing their effort can boost their confidence and motivation .
celebration do not have to be elaborate .
sometimes a simple word of praise or a special family activity is all it take to show that you are proud of them .
those are such valuable tip michael .
i especially love the idea of celebrating both the big and small achievement .
it is a great way to keep child motivated and to show them that their hard work is appreciated .
and i think your point about encouraging a growth mindset is particularly important michael .
it is crucial for child to understand that they can improve through effort and that mistake are part of the learning process .
this mindset not only help them in school but also in life .
exactly adam .
it is all about helping our child build the confidence to face challenge head on knowing that they have the support and resource to succeed .
and remember every child is different what work for one child might not work for another .
it is important to be flexible and willing to try different approach until you find what work best for your child .
thank you much for sharing your experience and advice with u michael .
i am sure our listener have found it incredibly helpful .
your story about emma is a wonderful example of how parental involvement can make a real difference in a child education .
it is been a pleasure julia .
i am glad i could share my experience and i hope it encourages other parent to get involved in their childrens education .
it is one of the most rewarding thing you can do a a parent .
absolutely michael .
and i think the key takeaway here is that being involved doesnt have to be complicated .
it is about showing up being supportive and creating an environment where your child feel valued and encouraged .
with that we are going to wrap up this segment .
but before we do julia do you have any final thought ?
that i hope our listener feel empowered to take an active role in their childrens education .
a weve discussed today even small action can make a big difference .
whether it is setting up a study space staying in touch with teacher or simply praising your child effort remember that your involvement is crucial to their success .
and once again thank you michael for joining u and sharing your valuable insight .
we appreciate your time and your commitment to supporting your childrens education .
it is been a pleasure and i am always happy to help .
and to all our listener thank you for tuning in today .
we hope you found this discussion helpful and inspiring .
remember supporting your child education is one of the most important thing you can do a a parent .
well be back next time with more tip and advice .
stay tuned .
until next time keep encouraging your child stay involved in their education and most importantly believe in their potential .
all michael weve covered a lot of ground today .
your insight have been incredibly valuable but i am sure our listener might still have a few question .
julia and i have a couple of question ourselves that we think will help parent who are navigating the challenge of supporting their childrens education .
michael one thing that come to mind is the balance between helping your child and giving them enough space to learn independently .
this is something many parent struggle with .
how did you manage this with your own child ?
did you ever find it difficult to step back and let them figure thing out on their own ?
and it is something i think all parent grapple with at some point .
when your child struggling the instinct is to step in and fix the problem for them .
but over time ive learned that it is important to give them the tool they need to solve problem independently while still being there a a support system .
for example with my son jake there were time when he would get frustrated with a difficult homework problem .
my first instinct wa to give him the answer or guide him step by step .
but i realized that this approach wasnt helping him develop critical thinking skill .
instead i started asking him guiding question to help him think through the problem on his own .
id say thing what do you think the first step should be ?
or have you seen a problem this before ?
how did you solve that one ?
this way i wa still involved but i wa encouraging him to take the lead .
it wasnt always easy to hold back .
but over time jake became more confident in his ability and more willing to tackle challenge on his own .
of course i wa always there to step in if he truly needed help .
but by giving him the space to try on his own first he learned to trust his instinct and develop his problem solving skill .
thats such an important point michael .
it is about finding that balance between being supportive and fostering independence .
and it sound your approach not only helped jake academically but also built his confidence in facing challenge .
now another challenge many parent face is managing their own expectation and pressure around their child education .
we live in a world where academic success is often seen a a key indicator of future success .
and this can create a lot of stress for both parent and child .
how did you handle these pressure ?
and what advice would you give to parent who are feeling overwhelmed by the desire for their child to succeed ?
you are absolutely adam .
the pressure to succeed academically can be intense and it is easy for parent to feel they have to push their child to excel in every subject .
but what ive learned over the year is that success is not about grade .
it is about helping your child develop a love for learning and the resilience to overcome challenge .
with my daughter emma for example i had to remind myself that it wa if she did not get straight a in every subject .
what mattered more wa that she wa trying her best and that she wa happy and healthy .
i made a conscious effort to focus on her overall development not her academic performance .
i encouraged her to explore her interest whether that wa reading art or sport and i tried to celebrate her effort rather than the outcome .
my advice to other parent would be to take a step back and look at the bigger picture .
ask yourself what person do i want my child to become ?
focus on nurturing quality curiosity kindness and perseverance rather than academic achievement .
and remember it is to adjust your expectation based on your child individual strength and interest .
every child is unique and success can look different for each one .
thats such a refreshing perspective michael .
it is easy to get caught up in the pressure to perform but it is important to remember that education is about more than grade .
it is about helping child grow into rounded individual .
now let talk about the challenge that come with balancing work life and being actively involved in your child education .
many parent especially working parent struggle to find the time to be a involved a they would to be .
but what ive found is that it is not necessarily about the quantity of time you spend but the quality .
one thing that worked for me wa setting aside specific time each day or week that were dedicated to my child .
it did not have to be long .
sometimes it wa fifteentwenty minute but during that time i would focus entirely on them .
whether it wa helping with homework reading together or talking about their day those moment became meaningful .
another tip is to involve your child in your daily routine .
for example if you are cooking dinner ask them to help and use that time to talk about what they are learning in school .
if you are running errand bring them along and have a conversation about something educational math when you are shopping or geography when you are driving .
finally do not be afraid to ask for help .
if you have a partner family member or even a friend who can pitch in that can make a big difference .
and remember it is to prioritize your own being too .
if you are stressed and overwhelmed it is harder to be present for your child .
make sure you are taking care of yourself a . those are such practical and reassuring tip michael .
it is all about finding way to be involved that fit into your life rather than feeling you have to do everything perfectly .
and i think what you said about quality time is important .
it is those focused intentional moment that make a difference .
absolutely adam .
and i love the idea of involving child in everyday activity a a way to stay connected and support their learning .
it is a great reminder that education doesnt happen in the classroom .
it is a part of life .
now let take a moment to see if we have any question from our listener .
weve received a few interesting one in advance .
here one from sarah a mother of two who asks michael how do you handle situation where your child is resistant to your involvement or help with schoolwork ?
my son often say he doesnt need my help and get frustrated when i try to get involved .
how can i support him without making him feel pressured ?
thats a thoughtful question sarah .
and i completely understand where you are coming from .
it is not uncommon for child especially a they get older to want more independence and resist parental involvement .
in situation this it is important to respect their need for autonomy while also finding way to offer support .
one approach ive found helpful is to take a step back and give your child some control over how and when you get involved .
for example you might say i am here if you need any help but i trust that you can handle this on your own .
let me know if there anything specific youd to talk through or if you need a second pair of eye on something .
this way you are letting them know that you are available without being overbearing .
another strategy is to focus on openended conversation rather than direct assistance .
instead of saying do you need help with your homework ?
you might ask how do you feel about the assignment you are working on ?
or whats the most interesting thing you learned today ?
this can lead to a more relaxed conversation where your child feel comfortable sharing without feeling they are being pressured to accept help .
lastly try to reinforce the idea that making mistake and asking for help are normal part of the learning process .
sometimes child resist help because they are worried about disappointing their parent or because they want to prove they can do it on their own .
by creating an environment where it is to ask question and make mistake you can help alleviate some of that pressure .
thats such great advice michael .
it is all about finding that balance between being supportive and respecting your child growing independence and i think sarah will appreciate your thoughtful response .
yes thank you for that michael and thank you to our listener for sending in your question .
we always love hearing from you and it is valuable to have these reallife question to discus .

it is been a pleasure being here and i hope that my experience can help other parent who are on this journey .

and do not forget to celebrate the small victory along the way .
wise word michael .
and with that we are going to wrap up today episode .
we hope you found this discussion helpful and that you are leaving with some new idea to try out at home .
remember supporting your child education is one of the most important thing you can do and even small effort can make a big difference .
every step you take a a parent to support your child learning is a step toward helping them grow into confident capable individual .
it doesnt have to be perfect consistent and heartfelt .

julia weve had a truly enlightening conversation today about the critical role parent play in supporting their childrens education .
let take a moment to recap some of the key point weve discussed .
absolutely adam .
we began by talking about the importance of creating a positive learning environment at home .
whether it is setting up a quiet organized study space or finding creative way to make learning fun it is clear that the atmosphere parent create at home can significantly impact their child ability to learn effectively .
we also touched on the importance of communication between parent and teacher staying informed about your child progress attending parentteacher meeting and maintaining open line of communication with educator can help parent better understand their child need and how they can best support them .
and we can not forget about the power of encouragement and motivation .
a michael shared celebrating your child effort recognizing their achievement and providing positive reinforcement are all crucial in helping child stay motivated and confident in their academic journey .
those are such valuable point julia .
creating a positive environment maintaining good communication and encouraging our child are all step we a parent can take to ensure our kid feel supported and empowered to succeed in school .
and now michael wed love to hear your final thought .
whats one piece of advice youd to leave our listener with a they continue to support their childrens education ?
if there one thing id parent to remember it is that your involvement in your child education doesnt have to be perfect or overwhelming .
what matter most is that you are present that you show interest in their learning and that you are there to support them through both the success and the challenge .
small consistent action can make a big difference .
whether it is a simple conversation at the end of the day helping with homework or attending school event every little bit count .
and do not forget to take care of yourself too because when you are at your best you can give your best to your child .
thats such important advice michael .
parenting is a journey and it is those small everyday moment of support and care that truly shape our childrens future .

welcome to the upclosed podcast .
your home for conversation about the present and future of public education .
on today episode we are going to explore one of the most critical issue facing this country and that is a teacher shortage and educator shortage .
now more than at any time in recent memory we know that educator are leaving the profession and alarming rate .
a national survey that wa conducted by the national education association earlier this year revealed that a whopping fifty five of educator are considering leaving the profession earlier than planned .
and yet we know that a quality public education start with quality educator .
we need quality educator and education support professional in our public education system .
i am honored to welcome and to introduce to some and to introduce to others president becky pringle president of the nea the national education association welcome becky .
it is good to be with you sarah .
becky ha the awesome task of leading more than three million educator and education support professional who are member of the nea in this country .
she is a former middle school teacher .
we are honored .
i will tell you that during her time with the nea among her other accomplishment president pringle ha cochair the neas task force on school discipline and a school to present pipeline .
but let me tell you something .
if i were to enumerate all of president pringles accomplishment we would be here all day .
at this point i am going to welcome becky again and once again say how excited we are to have this important conversation with you a we look to the future of public education .
earlier this year the nea published a report on the educator shortage that is gripping the nation public school and through that report you outlined a long list of researchbased solution effective at recruiting and retaining educator and most importantly reflecting the need and priority of educator themselves .
from where you sit can you tell u why you think educator are at this time rethinking their place in the teaching profession and the education profession and whether or not they can remain a educator .
sarah again it is good to be with you .
i want to emphasize the part of my bio that talk about experience and education .
i taught middle school science .
yes there a special place in heaven for me and other middle school teacher .
i taught middle school middle level learner the joy of science for over thirty year .
when i talk about the educated crisis i talk about it from a place of experience knowledge a an educator .
now a president of the nea not only do i have that experience a a leader in the association i am bringing to bear the full force weight power strength of the largest labor union in the country but i do it from that lens of being a teacher .
this is not a new crisis .
this is chronic .
it ha existed when i wa in a classroom and it exists now .
it is with everything else the pandemic made it worse because thats what the pandemic did .
and the pandemic .
honestly helped u shine a light on something that weve been talking about and trying to sound the alarm around for many many year .
and the report that we that the nea issue and it is one of the thing that i insist on because of the conversation that i had with educator all over this country when i did what i called my georgia since an excellent store .
and i asked educator teacher and support that .
notice counselor aspiring educator and we can educate this question .
ask question and help u . i am sharing with what their hope and dream were what the concern were helped me understand why we saw in our survey fifty five of our educator talking about leaving the pressure to help me understand that .
and not the why but what would what could change that would would change their mind about about leaving .
and the report is full of research based solution a you said and i want to emphasize it it is the voice and experience of our educator when we talk about those solution .
and sarah i am sure i know youve heard this work because educator everywhere are using this work they tell me that it is about respect and i get that .
i absolutely get that .
a a teacher we never had the level of respect and support that we should have had should have a the professional we are .
when i asked him to peel that away dig into that what doe that look ?
what doe respect look to you ?
they were very clear about what that looked to them .
and they started with being treated a the professional they are .
and for them that meant that they had the authority and the collective autonomy to make teaching and learning decision for their student .
but it meant for them is that they had a that they earned a professional salary that reflected the important role they played in our society .
what it meant for them is that they got to make professional decision about how they spent their time in a way that they could attend to the individual need of student could welcome and who parent a partner could collaborate with their with their colleague .
for them it meant u treating the teaching profession a a continuum of practice professional practice .
at the front end a they were preparing a aspiring educator to become teacher and to continue to focus on improving their professional practice .
and then having those opportunity to lead in their profession they talked about all of those thing .
and they talked about the reality that they can not do it by themselves and share responsibility .
we say every student that we mean every student will succeed .
we need all of the social system surrounding our child with them or they mean they are ready to ready to come to school prepared to learn every day .
thank you much becky for sharing all of that .
and there many thing that youve said that id to follow up on .
youve spoken about how educator want choice and autonomy a they lead in their classroom and the opportunity to innovate .
and i think that for those whove not been in a classroom they might imagine of course thats what educator do thats what educator have the opportunity to do .
but you talk about it a something that educator are hoping for more of what are the barrier now to exercise to exercising that autonomy ?
they are trained .
they go to school a you very know .
they have to graduate and be licensed and they have to have content skill knowledge skill and ability a a pedagogical skill all of those thing and it is continuous training .
all of that go in to making those key decision that we can meet student where they are and help them along their learning journey .
it doesnt suggest that we a educator do not know and embrace the responsibility for continuous learning with our colleague and with others .
thats why you use that phrase intentionally collective authority that we are making decision that are best for our student in collaboration with others other educator with our parent with the student themselves much need to be attended to around student agent in their own learning .
all of those thing go in for educator go into that concept of a professional authority and collective autonomy .
what do you think can be done a presentpringle to increase those opportunity for educator and to open the door and to let them know that they have the respect they deserve they have the support they deserve .
first of all they are in position with it making decision .
ive used this word a lot myself and we use it a lot .
we talk about we talk about educator voice and absolutely their voice is paramount to getting it for student but it can not be voice .
it can not be my goodness we are going to invite you to share what you think but we are going to make decision .
we are the designer and well be making the decision and there have to be in that scene of decision making and then say say before not an isolation but they have to be able to make those decision .
thats what it look for them .
they have to know that they have the resource that they need to meet the need growing need .
we could talk about that on a whole other segment .
it is always been true that student bring the all the ill and challenge of society to our school outsourced .
thats always been true but it certainly ha grown over the year and after the pandemic even more the trauma the social and emotional need all of that and in the school need that .
and we have to have the resource to do the job we love .
we have to address the fact that weve disinvested in public education for decade we can not make up with a onetime infusion of money .
weve got to make that up in a way that we imagine our system and a way that we fund it in an equitable way that all of our student all of them get what they need .
where educator have not been central in the formation of those idea and those practice and forth .
i think if there i do not know that there necessarily a question when i have said but it is further common on what you have said .
it is important that educator voice and educator leadership is shaping instructional practice and more in school .
i do not know before i am going to take a little bit of a left term .
i do not know if you want to jump in further .
i love the way you phrase that to u . i want to lift it up that educator are central .
central in the formation of idea and i would add because sometimes that happens and then it take on this other reality because then educator are not then central to the implementation and central into ensuring that the resource are there .
theyve got to be central in each of those piece because weve got lot of idea .
i do not know if you and i say or well talk about our one of our love that we share and that is community school but thats an example i can give you many because i said ive been around a minute .
i see good idea that educator promoted get implemented in a way that thats loosely are not founded or executed in a way that the educator would imagine or certainly would do themselves .
it is got to be central to the formation of the idea central to the implementation central to the assessment ?
and the learning where educator want to continuously learn and what we call it wa i could come up with a better term than this but what we call scoping and scaling and you and i are doing them .
i am not sure i want to use that phrase but what .
yes spreading the learning and in a way that we have identified those core or and key principle but not that we are lifting it from this place and clapping it in another place and saying do this and youll be fine .
no that fly in the face of that what theyve been collaborative autonomy that that school that community is a part of it ?
and they own it and it is about them and it reflects their highest idea .
i wanted to i love that you said it that way and i wanted to expand on that .
can you talk a little bit about what you learn through your report preparation of that report and what the neas position is now on this issue of the particular increasing teacher of color in this country .
you are that it is a long time issue .
there no question about that and i want to talk about it from this perspective and in your first question you asked about the attracting and retaining and especially in this conversation we have to pay attention to the to the retention piece of thing .
this is a question that the number of college student of color who are making the choice to go into education ha declined .
we know that is true .
and i am struggling with saying it out wherever they leave at such a higher rate .
yeah that it is the retention problem is almost more critical .
and i want to call attention to that and i am going to lift up the work of dr. ivory tolson who is an extraordinary work in higher education and ha supported our work around hbcus and msis .
and he wa the first one to grab my face and said becky we appreciate that you are lifting that up that we need more student of color to go in .
but you need to be aware of the retention issue because not aware of that .
not only are you not going to solve the retention issue you in looking at the retention issue it help you on the attracting piece of thing .
and we see dig down into that in his research which i encourage you to listen to to dig into it .
but doe expose some of those thing that we have to address on both side .
one of the thing with teacher of college student of color choosing teaching and then after they get into teaching if they choose it staying in teaching .
and i believe that in this country we have never and it is gotten worse .
addressing issue of the cost of higher education .
we we have student of color who are graduating passive amount of debt .
why you not uniquely impacting them in a debt at a rate .
thats because of student of color ten to come from the family that do not have generation or thats an overstayment .
and they do not they do not have parent that maybe can step in and take over those loan .
they are starting their career where they have mountain of debt .
they are putting off having family they are making choice about where they live or what they can do .
and they then say i can not do it .
and they leave .
and student in college are making that decision too .
and looking at teaching and saying wait a minute i am accumulate knowledge that and i can not i can not i can not choose teaching .
it is a rare cause i know i am not going to i am never going to earn the pay thats commensurate with the work that i do .
and i am directly that address it at the same thing .
the other thing that i do the other thing i want to highlight we talk about diversifying the profession .
yes oftentimes and we point to the impact we have research on this .
the impact that a teacher of color can have on a student of color especially multiple teacher of color having them in a room .
but we also have evidence sarah that that having a diverse workforce impact why student too .
got to tell both both side of the story .
and then the last thing ill also i think go on and on about it .
but the last thing i want to lift up is and this come directly from our student our spy rage occupators a a our early career educator of color .
and that is that they get into the profession or they are aspiring to it .
and they do not have that support system .
that now work in the unique circumstance they find them .
and those are the kind of thing that we heard from them .
and those are the kind of program that any a is putting in place .
we know also becky this another dimension of that which is grievous and which our listener may not be aware of folk now talk about is the lifeo issue the fact last and first out .
and of course thats counterproductive to our desire to see a growth in teacher of color across the country .
what is the position of the nea on that ?
and what what do you think can be done that this doesnt become a two step forward one step back phenomenon ?
and the reason i bring that up in this context is because it is all lifeo .
it is always brought up in a way that the union are the reason why because of contract thats why we have to let the last thing go first .
when we know that for u we are about collaborating with others to absolutely best the job we possibly can for our student and for our educator go always tying back to the fact that we need more educator and we need to support them .
first of all the way we approached it they are in another place is why why why why why we are doing that we need more teacher .
let why why is anybody leaving ?
why is that happening ?
that shouldnt be happening .
what are we doing to resource that to that district ?
then they are not letting go of any educator .
the west side bayer and come together and collaborate together to get the resource that we have we can lower those class eye .
nobody leaving .
we are bringing more in .
there that .
additionally we know when we use it when we talk about it from that contentious place we talk about it a though other educator are expendable that thats not true .
we need our middle we need our midcareer teacher our world ha a midcareer educator a mentor .
thats why it is important to build the processing system and structure to support collaboration throughout the system that we have all of the educator .
the new new mid and veteran educator there a color in every category .
educator are bringing a wealth of experience to you geographically in other diversity in other way and not track this issue up a a false choice in which it should not be .
but we have the collaborate together and it should never be used a a way to suggest that we are not working to diversify our profession .
we are using strategy to address the issue of teacher pay .
we know that public education is the foundation of this democracy and for those people who have made that choice to educate america student weve got to collectively own that responsibility to elevate the profession .
i wanted to say that .
for u at the n e a it is about using a variety of strategy .
it is a union of course we are going to use our strategy of collective bargaining where we can and we have work with our local to use that to not only be strongly for increase in pay but to do a couple of thing .
using collective bargaining to pay for higher salary is a strategy of course that weve used before .
not all of our state have the ability to use collective bargaining weve been using strategy the one we use in louisiana where our affiliate there use the legislature to teach your salary and pay salary and we benefit .
and we use a variety of strategy to advocate for and demand higher salary .
we can not teach your pay if our school are not being adequately resource .
we have to address that at every level have to address it at the local level .
fighting to raise revenue at the local level changing how public school are funded and having them tied to the housing .
we know automatically set up a system of inequity .
we have to address it at the local level .
we have to address it at the state level .
the majority of funding for our school come at the state level .
we have to absolutely fight that at the state legislature fight for that at the state legislature and then of course the federal government role .
one of the thing that people do not always tie to what i said is the federal government promise to fund the fund idea which is the individual with disability education act the provides resource for our student with special need at a rate of forty .
and they never did that .
and that mean that the local and state have to pick that up .
and the federal government ha a role to play not in general education funding but specifically in special education funding .
funding is a key piece of the work we have to do to raise salary for educator .
and then lastly i want to mention this weve talked about which which we call a wage penalty gap which is existed again forever .
but after the pandemic we saw it rise throughout the pandemic .
it went from around twenty to now it is a little over twenty five .
that mean that similarly situated profession in term of experience and education teacher earn twenty five le .
thats not .
that is a societal issue that we have to address from the highest level of our government .
it is a societal issue .
indeed and there are many thing you said id to pick up on .
you said quickly but id to go back to something that the nea foundation is also fierce about .
and that is that the preservation and furtherance of public education is in the public interest .
public education is a public good .
i believe that a the nea doe such powerful work in collective bargaining and forth is building public will for public education .
and i am interested in your thought about that of course this is this also is not new .
it doe seem that a midsomony other pressing issue the country is facing .
there is this question of public education a a public good .
can you talk about absolutely and i would add a public good and thats the foundation of this democracy ?
yes we know .
yeah and thats why thats our founding more principle that that every every one of our student ha access to a quality high quality public education .
and we know that an educated citizen of student who are prepared to think critically and make and solve problem collaboratively we know our absolutely essential to our country living into it promise .
yeah we the people we the people we the people all of u have that to pursue happiness to be truly free .
for that to be a reality for everyone weve got to ensure that all of our student have that high quality public education .
and it can not be based on the zip code .
it can not be based on the family generational or current economic status .
it can it can not be based on race .
it ha to be based on their birthright a an american or for those whove come to our country a immigrant making sure that they have those opportunity .
they are not kept from those opportunity because they do not have fund to do it .
our country wa founded on that .
because if we do that if we create a system that work for our most marginalized student it will increase the opportunity for all of our student .
and that is how our country will live into it promise .
i believe that very much myself a doe the whole of the nea foundation .
i am trying to say in the most hopeful of perspective what are we looking for ?
we are we are looking for racial social and education justice for student for educator for community .
thats at the core for me it is at the core of everything .
and when people say to me becky thats a big old aspirational vision you all student all school all educator are excelled again everyone know it .
and for u to do that to first a a country to truly embrace that first of all to union honestly to the work toward that you you you always hear a common theme whenever i talk and you heard it today .
and that that is a core that core value of partnership .
we can not we can not do it alone .
within even within our own our own association sarah ive been talking about the concept of dynamic alignment that i love to say with a large slavery union in this country .
we have fifty one state affiliate .
we have fourteenzero local .
we have three million member .
unless and until we are lined in a way thats dynamic it is it is a constantly learning and with within among each other we are reaching across and helping each other and way that that that magnify that strength and power .
in way that we can win for our student all the time every day .
until unless that happens we are not going to reach that that full potential .
you always hear that .
and everything i say when you when you talk about a wish list it is that we continue that work together in a dynamic and aligned way toward racial social economic justice in this country .
and and that is and everything we do and i will tell you sarah every decision i make is steeped in that .
everything we do reflects that collaborative and collective responsibility for every one of our student .
what a wonderful vision and certainly one that that we share in a . and it is a good place to to start to turn toward home in the in this time together .
they want to be involved in solution making and they are not all educator .
they come from all walk .
i always to ask those who are on our podcast if you could speak to the listener that there something that everyone can do a pertains to this issue of a teacher shortage .
what how can the average person who not in the classroom or or if someone is what what would you hope we would be doing to support this important vision of education justice and education in social justice generally ?
because again we believe there is a role that everyone can play .
i would ask everyone whether you are in education or you are not in education to understand and own the responsibility regardless .
id to recommend that you could take that individual journey learn and read and i would i would appoint folk to pay a side at justice because it ha lot of resource you can do that .
and then reach out to others and have critical conversation that you can continue that learning and building up your your muscle and and that thing .
build partnership thats one of the thing that any a ha been focused on at the federal level .
yeah i mentioned the department of education ill mention the department of labor .
one of the thing that we are proud about is our partnership with them in establishing the the registered apprenticeship for teacher .
thats something completely a hundred million dollar of partner laborer put in to partner with u to have registered apprenticeship that educator inspiring educator whether they are in education or not can earn while they learn and be mentored by teacher .
thats part of the attracting and retaining piece of thing .
think about what partnership you can engage in in your community whether it is with with civil right organization or with parent or organization create space for student voice invite student into the conversation and give them that space and support them in their fight .
i am proud of them and the fight that they waged to around gun violence huge huge wa they did with u . create that space for for for student and then ill go back to something i said earlier asura we have to a participant in this democracy .
we have to pay attention to the people we put in position of power .
that necessarily mean asking question and holding people accountable .
yeah not holding a accountable .
i to say being that wind beneath their wing they can they can govern in a bold and righteous and focused and compelling and wait .
those are the kind of thing people can do now today .
but is awesome and response back .
yeah my goodness .
thank you much for that .
present pringle i always to close these podcasts by asking those we are interviewing .
if there is anything that they might to add .
id to see is there anything that i have not asked you or that you would want to add to this important conversation a president of the nea ?
say i shared earlier that i wa in the class for over thirty year .
and i have to tell you that in these last two and a half year a we all struggle through a pandemic and try to keep our student and educate a a community safe and continue to learn and deal with the trauma of being in a global pandemic .
i have never never been more proud to call myself a teacher .
be an educator .
a i am in this moment a i had the opportunity to not only honestly hold in my arm teacher from all of this country a a cry .
and i gave space for them to share their fear and challenge but to see the light in their eye .
and i would ask for everyone to celebrate our educator and what they have done in this moment what theyve always done honestly but it is one of the highest need how they stepped up in way who could never imagine .
take that time please to celebrate them to lift them up to say thank you .
and to let them know we got you .
wow president pringol it ha been my great honor to have this time with you and to bring your voice to people through this podcast your passion your conviction your commitment to public education and to educator across this country .

i am an american but i live in germany .
ive lived in europe most of my adult life .
and i speak three different language fluently .
of course english .
and spanish and german .
because i live in germany .
german is the language of communication for me .
i am a professor at several university here in germany .
a a working in many other university across the world .
i do a lot of online learning online teaching .
and i have a company in the netherlands called syntax solution .
and we are educational consultant helping midsize to large company .

and we also consult university a too .

and he is an educational rock star .
yes there is a comment about you .
yes thank you very much .
it is a very good job .
and all .
thank you .
what wa your training point or point in your own education ?
ive had a long career .
i studied education .
but did not start teaching until later on in my life .
because i moved into the corporate world where i did adult learning and worked for a very large company in london out of new york .
and i worked in the personnel department human resource management human resource development .
got to see learning and education from the corporate world .
and i think that wa the debate my theory that i learned in education wa a good basis for me to start .
but i had to do a lot of learning in order to do my job .
and that job took me all over the world .
i wa able to work in new york san francisco hong kong buenos aire virginia switzerland and london of course .
and that wa great .
by the time i wa twenty eight i had traveled a lot .
for year a lot about adult education .
that wa one of the milestone in my education .
but that wa pretty early in my career .
and then i decided to take a job in germany for two year a a consultant .
and wound up staying here and ive been in germany now since one thousand nine hundred and ninety .
wow wonderful great .
it is wonderful i am sure. . let move to another question .
and would you that anything else ?
in the time that ive been here ive held a lot of different job .
pretty much helped many job already in the academic world .
and i did my phd here in germany and of course that led to me coming into the world of academia which i had never planned .
that wa not a plan .
it wa something that happened that way .
and soon after i opened up my first business here in germany .
and that led to me opening up five different school .
i wa also the owner of school throughout europe .
i had two school in germany .
i had a school in the netherlands a school in spain and also a school in greece .
up for our school in greece and spain we were doing medical english which wa not medical english medical german .
we were working in the european community project .
and my school in germany were geared more towards teacher education .
and i did that for about eighteen year .
and it wa before corona that we decided that we would slowly cut those school down because what we felt that the market wa moving more towards online learning .
and that wa a very great decision because that decision wa made before corona .
you are lucky then .
do we do the field that we needed office space anymore ?
because everything we were doing wa online anyway .
and i wa doing a lot of online learning a . it wa a great decision .
i am glad we made that decision because then corona came and we realized that if we would have stayed open we probably would have gone bankrupt .
yeah i am sure you answered and you would have lost of time the school time about it because many had i think .
yeah many school closed because of but for u the decision wa the strategic decision .
it wa a great decision .
god you were the group .
we made a great decision .
thank you very much .
thank you ron .
and you have a huge experience about teaching and learning learning of course .
and i am sure that during this experience and year you have tried lot of methodology and try strategy and also use them in your lesson or try to transfer these to the other teacher during your training .
and probably you have a a philosophy .
what is it ?
what is your philosophy of teaching ?
i think when you go to school and study education you learn a lot of theory .
but a a young teacher you got to get in there and start doing it because you are not going to have a highly developed teaching philosophy .
it take a while to develop that because youve got to have some experience classroom experience .
and youve got to be around other teacher a because being around other teacher help you to learn what they are doing .
you exchange information but coming from the corporate world learning work in a different way for adult .
and pretty much constructive approach to learning is very important for adult .
adult have to have handson experience .
they need to have task and adult understand what task are because thats what they have every day at work .
and they know that they have to be responsible to fulfilling those task .
the level of responsibility is already built in to how adult learn in the corporate world .
and that developed my teaching philosophy a i moved into the academic world .
and i have always been a constructiveist take constructiveist approach and for teacher teaching in academic situation at school whether that be primary school secondary school university a good example of constructiveist approach would be taskbased learning yes projectbased learning phenomenonbased learning all the pbls .
i wrote an article about get your pbls which i keep posting on my linkedin site a a my facebook site because i have a lot of follower on social medium .
and it is important to know your methodology but if you want to take constructiveist approach to learning and teaching you should know the minimum of taskbased learning and know the difference between a task and an activity because they are not the same .
and know all of your pbls and you are going in the direction of being constructiveist in your classroom .
thats influence my teaching philosophy because i do believe le i said in the beginning that lawyer need to be the creator of content .
and through constructiveist approach that will definitely happen .
thank you very much .
thank you very much for the information that to give about your philosophy of teaching .
if i am not wrong you are providing a consultancy to the school or the teacher when they need it .
you give them a support if i am not wrong .
why do that on social medium every day ?
yeah you do that .
and how do you for example when they ask you teacher or school when they ask your support and how do they help them and what do they need most ?
and in every time when you help them and are you successful about it or sometimes do you fail about it ?
can you tell u about it ?
there are a lot of thing that teacher need to know to be effective in the classroom .
and technology is one of them .
the integration of technology into teaching and learning is extremely important .
we can go back to the experience that teacher had worldwide when it come to when the pandemic started .
we could see that many teacher were not prepared for the pandemic because they had no experience with online learning and with technology .
and another discovery that teacher that wa one of those rude awakening and that teaching online is not the same thing a teaching in the classroom .
this requires a different pedagogical approach .
technology is one thing that teacher need to have and knowing the difference between facetoface learning and online learning and the different pedagogical approach that they need which lead to again them understanding framework .
tpack is a framework that i think many teacher need to be familiarized with and knowing that thats one of the thing that i think is very important .
if you do not know what tpack is you can google that .
i do not think we have a time to get into the detail of that .
they got to learn all of those thing .
and yes i do help private language school i have before but they are not my main client .
it is mostly university .
i work with a lot of professor phd student who are doing their phd they have to learn how to research they have to speak english they have to learn a lot of different skill .
and the professor that i work with thats why i have my job at the university that i work at is i am involved in an emi program which is english a a medium of instruction .
i work with specialist expert who are physicist scientist and i do not math the mathematician and very complicated science taught me .
now at the university i work at we have a language department .
i do not work in the language department and i do not work with any professor who ha not reached very high b1 level entry b2 level .
theyve got to get the basic of language behind them that we can work together in a onetoone coaching session to help them to improve their english because they want to deliver their class in english and help them with methodology a too .
thats the answer .
thank you .
thank you adam i understand that this is a support that youve given the teacher or the school .
i do work shop at for teacher organization and travel around the world doing that .
it is very hard to take something i try to be very general in nature when i am working with teacher and teacher organization because of the different context that they work in .
it take a while for them to accept that teaching and learning .
i understand it is sometimes hard for them to adopt it .
and far because we are here an a hard for the student .
the board exactly thank you very much .
thank you very much ron .
i would to ask i am sure that you have a i mentioned before that you have a huge experience and also you have lot of story .
i am sure that you have a success story too .
is it possible to tell u one or two success story of yours something inspirational what would to share ?
i think i am sixty five year old and i have to say ive been very blessed in my career but i work very hard .
and i am one of those people who threw themselves into work because i what i do .
and ive learned a lot in my journey a being a teacher .
weve had i think all of u could tell story of success but we probably have more story of failure than we do with success because thats the reality of teaching .
i think .
we learning by doing but yes there are a lot of thing that i can say i am very proud of .
i am very proud of the fact that i am a risk attacker and leaving the united state leaving my friend leaving my family leaving my culture and moving to another country permanently wa a big move in my life .
but i did it when i wa young and i stood a lot of energy .
and glad i did that when i wa a younger because it wa a great move a very very great move .
and i am very proud of that that i had enough nerve to do it .
and i think the other thing that i could say that i am also very proud of in my career is the fact that i took the risk of opening up a business and not knowing what wa going to come .
i had a lot of idea of how i would want to do thing .
and every day wa a learning experience for me .
and the first two year were very difficult but i had a fulltime job .
i did not always get my wholetime job .
and once the school became successful when we started to grow and started to learn a lot about business and i studied business .
i have an mba in international business administration .
and all of those thing i learned were theory but when you have your own business you start to see the thing from firsthand .
i learned a lot there .
i am glad i survived that .
and i could probably write a book about that .
owning a business in education is fun .
but i wa glad when i closed my school .
and i am glad now for the where i am at now in my life .
my life is a little bit easier not stressful .
and i can enjoy all the thing that ive worked for in my life my garden .
thank you .
thank you very much aron .
and i would to ask you that another question something related with the education and a we all know that the artificial intelligence is getting bigger and bigger and take the huge part in our the daily life especially the social medium .
and also i think it is it is moving to every part of every part of the the the job .
and also it is also in the education .
and what do you think ?
what do you think about ai and the language education ?
whats going to happen with it ?
those are several question .
but let me start by saying that everybody seems to have their all in an uproar about ai but ai is not new .
it is been around for a long time .
and weve been using ai and ai is integrated into everything that we do .
now i have been using ai for many different reason .
work time many different project .
teacher training is not new for me .
ive been doing that for closer thirty year .
and one of the thing i had biggest problem i had there in teacher training wa teaching teacher how to use technology in the classroom .
and without even thinking that it wa ai a too .
but ai a we know it today a lot of people relate that to chat gpt .
and i think weve it is exploded in the last year that we have gotten past chat gpt because there are many different chat box that we can go to .
there different we have different alternative now .
for ai we do not need chat gpt .
we can use many others .
and i think that teacher do need to get on board .
they needed to get on board with technology integration into the classroom that they needed to get on board with online learning and situation developed that we realize that we get need those skill .
theyll probably be able to get a lowerpaying job but i think company in the corporate world need instructor trainer and some teacher who are up to date with their ai skill .
it is not a game it is again not a warning not something to instilled fear into teacher because there nothing to be afraid of .
it is another skill that you have to add to your skill skillset to be an effective teacher .
they should be getting on board .
and any of the teacher here today follow me on social medium theyll see that i always post a lot of information about ai and different site to go to to learn more about it .
and of course ill be doing a series of webinars about ai and lesson planning and instructional design and how all those thing fit together .
ill be doing a workshop this coming weekend for the german association of community college .
they are having there and all that .
and yeah i think it is a skill that you have to add to all the other skill that we need to effectively teach in the classroom .
i understand thank you thank you very much rome .
i wanted to ask you another question it is not something about ai but differently it is the to term instructional design .
this is i should i know either about it .
what is it ?
what is the instructional design and what is the role of in education ?
a i said earlier i came from a corporate background and in the corporate world of learning and adult learning we use the term instructional design .
that is not new .
it is not a new term .
when you are a trainer and you are working with adult in a corporate learning environment you do need to know how to put a course or a workshop together .
and that mean that you are going to youve got to have some skill that you bring to the table and youve got to be very organized .
you have to know how to organize a workshop or some a course at a company .
and that mean that you have to know how to do need analysis .
and youve got to know what knowledge and skill those people at that company need .
and youve got to develop skill .
are you got to develop task and project around those that they can learn because adult need on hand learning and they need task in order to learn something .
and they do not have a lot of time .
and you also have to know what skill and competency they a participant need to bring to the table to learn effectively a a getting a sense of learning successfully .
this is important .
and this is what instructional designer do .
they know that .
and they also know that the learner are there to fulfill a need .
a gap that they have that they need this to go further in their career .
it is very connected to their work .
and they understand how people learn adult .
and we sometimes a teacher use term interchangeably that is wrong pedagogy .
and we do not realize it .
pedagogy is about how young people learn primary school secondary school maybe even university .
but people and company and adult we use thats andrew gaudy .
and thats different principle of the idea of teaching and learning .
how we teach adult might not work for how we need to teach young people .
this is why i never talk about young learner primary school because i do not know anything about that .
but i do know about secondary school about i do know .
and thats very different because what happens in a primary school is different than what happens in a secondary school .
and what happens in a university is also different .
but instructional design is it is i do not want to say it is a science .
it is a but you can get a degree in it .
you can go to school and learn it .
but i do not think you have to these day .
there many great thing on linkedin and social medium google .
there online course that you can take .
i think it is better if you specialize in something .
and whatever that you want to do an instructional design course in .
because before you collect and you still can study at that university .
again you do not have to .
i did study that i wanted to learn more about that .
and i did that in my mid 20 because this kid wa part of my job .
now teacher working in state school and language school private language school they probably know a little bit about instructional design because they are doing le in planning .
but le in planning is the beginning of instructional design .
but now with ai you need to know what instructional design is because you need to be able to put together a three hundred and sixty degree lesson plan .
and thats different than these lesson plan that you can find online which are cookie cut and you you are going to have to tailor them to your need and change them .
but and again this is something that i havent talked too much about .
but i will be talking about that in the next couple of month .
this what is the three hundred and sixty degree lesson plan ?
because instructional designer know what that is .
they have to know what that is .
again instruction design is a skill .
it is a job .
and it is a job for adult learner .
but you can use it for primary school and secondary school university .
it is mostly about the corporate world .
but teacher need to start learning how do they teach and learn in the corporate world .
because this is what we are preparing our learner for especially at university is to enter the corporate world .
and of course that lead u to another topic of the future learning future proofing many idea that come with where are our student going to be in five year when they leave our class at the university .
i am very much into future proofing and integrating that into what i do in the classroom with my business student .
because i do teach business student a . and i want to make sure that they are learning the skill that they need to survive and to work effectively and have success in their career .
and i take a very instructional design approach when i put those class together .
thank you .
thank you very much for the information that you provide u here about instructional design .
thank you very much .
and also if i am not wrong we can find more information in your linkedin page .
i think about instructional design .
you could go to i am not going to say that i am a specialist in that but i know what it is .
but if you want to go and learn more about that go to youtube and google instructional design .
and you are probably going to come up with the name devlin peck .
and he ha some of the best video on learning about what instructional design is and all the different step of that .
and if you take the time if you are a selfdirected selfregulated learner and thats who i cater to on social medium is that you will listen to those video and learn much .
theyll answer all your question .
devlin peck on youtube is the best teacher for instructional design .
and they are free .
the afterdecessions are definitely going check because i wonder what do you think you are much for the information about it ?
and you mentioned a term i wa going to ask you but you mentioned it is selfdirected learning you said .
and this also another very important term .
what is that ?
what is selfdirected learning ?
and yes .
let me give you a little maybe an analogy .
and that is that when a teacher walk into the room and no matter they are going to be teachercentered or studentcentered .
but it should be the goal of a teacher to make sure that their learner have a little bit of voice and choice in what take place in the classroom .
selfdirected learning is we might not see it but there are a lot not everybody learns the same .
and there are some people who are highly motivated .
and they do not need people to tell them what to do .
they know that intuitively .
they are instinctive with that .
and we can see that a teacher and state school and maybe even language school that people who are selfmotivated and always do the homework always do the task .
they are always there .
they are motivated .
we do not have to motivate them .
but selfdirected person empowers themselves .
they want to learn .
they learning and they have their own strategy of learning and they make decision for themselves .
they create activity and task for themselves to learn .
and they go out on into google on the internet .
and they find resource for themselves to learn .
and they to learn in group a lot of time .
some selfdirected learner learn by themselves .
but for them it is important to learning group .
theyll form little study group or something .
and we see that a at school .
and they are very effective in their learning strategy .
they know what work for them .
they know what doesnt work .
they know what they .
they know what they do not .
and they are very critical sometimes about what they are learning and how they are learning .
and they are usually the first one to give you feedback in the classroom .
because they know what they want .
and it is great to have learner that .
but not everyone is that way .
and maybe from what i said you might think that a selfdirected learner is an extravert .
but not always .
a lot of time they are introvert .
a lot of people think that i am some big whatever extravert in life speaking whatever .
but i am a very quiet person in my private life .
and it take a lot of energy and nerve for me to get up and speak in front of people even though ive done it many time .
but i am a selfdirected learner .
ive always been .
ive always made decision for myself and found way for myself .
and i always find other people me who learning who are selfmotivated we do not have to motivate ourselves .
and when you are a selfdirect and i think teacher dream of having a classroom filled with selfdirected learner .
but if you have if you are lucky enough and i have in my life in my career to have a lot of selfdirected learner i turn those learner into my assistance in the classroom because they want extra task .
they want something else to do because they already know whats happening .
they are in touch with everything .
they have a very high sense of reality .
and again they know what they want .
and they are always the one who step forward and ask if you need any help or anything .
and i always take advantage of that because we are going to have different kind of learner in our classroom .
and you definitely want to seek out the selfdirected learner .
and do not think that they are the extravert because sometimes the extravert are not always the selfdirected learner .
but it is the great thing to have a selfdirected learner in your classroom .
you became also if anything about the teacher site also teacher become motivated .
i think if i am not wrong we also become more motivated to see this have directed learner in your classroom .
i think we want to believe that maybe it is something we do in the classroom that lead them to selfdirected learning .
and then they want to be part of their learning process .
and when you are working with the adult adult do not usually talk about all those thing especially in the corporate world .
but student there is a social aspect of learning where they do share private thing with one another .
and this is why collaborative learning is extremely important to keep student motivated .
and hopefully if who you are highly motivated selfdirected learner are and you make sure that you separate them correctly in group when you are doing collaborative learning you can make selfdirected learning contagious if how to work with that .
but it take a while i think to understand how that work .
and again it is not something you are going to learn one day after leaving university .
you got to get into the classroom and start learning what learning is about and the dynamic of learning .
but definitely selfdirected learning is one of those phenomenon that happens in learning .
something that we all wish for because in the end i think it is important that we see that our learner are doing thing by themselves .
they are making good decision for themselves .
and we have to be on the side guiding the and managing the process of learning .
and when you get to that point when your classroom can manage itself then youve got a group of selfdirected learner .
thank you .
thank you ron for giving a lot of information about selfdirected learning to u . thank you very much .
and i would to move to another question .
i know that you have youve been giving lot of presentation or training session in your career far .
when you think about them session or presentation physically face to face what wa over the most interesting situation or situation that you faced ?
this interesting doesnt always mean something positive .
but maybe i said that interesting but if you want to say something vice versa another problem .
because i can say something on both side there .
i think it is interesting that a lot of teacher i have a face book side called webinars for english teacher which we have about thirty fivezero teacher there all over the world who come there and i always post free webinars that are taking place and whatever .
now during corona that wa important because a lot of teacher got to get a lot of information that they needed to to help them get through corona .
and i met a lot of great people from that site all over the world .
and i have to say that one of the thing that is something i noticed that maybe i did not wa that teacher signed up for a webinar and they do not even know how zoom work .
they do not know how to work microsoft .
they do not know how to work word .
they do not know how to work google .
and they do not realize that if you are going to be doing online learning especially you a a teacher you have to have those skill .
you have to bring those skill to the table and you do not have to be a master at them but you should know the basic .
this make it complicated and frustrating .
and i am going to be quite honest with you .
i throw those people out now because i can not deal with it anymore .
i get impatient with it .
and on the good side there many teacher out there that this is the one thing that make me feel that i do feel i am filling a niche in the market .
i feel very uncomfortable asking for money and making people pay for thing .
but and i know that everybody there part of africa north africa the middle east india and southeast asia south america central america and the other teacher that follow me come from these country and these geographical area of the world .
and they do not have money to pay for all these expensive webinars .
and i believe that if you are a teacher and you your job it a a career for yourself that you are going to take the opportunity thats offered to you from some of the website that i run .
and i make sure that i run a clean ship .
i do not let a lot of spam on there .
i check whats on those side .
you will see that even on my social medium site mean personally .
i do not put private thing there politics picture of meme that are crazy or whatever of cat and squirrel and dog or whatever .
it is focused about education and pedagogical thing a technology ai .
and free webinars where you can learn because i do believe that if you want to be an effective teacher in the classroom money is not a barrier .
there are many thing out there that are for free .
take advantage of those thing .
and i know i have me .
and i want to make sure that teacher know that that you do not need to have a lot of money to learn and to get better and be a better teacher in the classroom and to learn how to improve your team back .
and even your content knowledge i think teacher we are teaching grammar syllabus oriented class .
they definitely are going to have a problem because this morning i googled english online grammar and got i think two hundred and fifty million result .
why would somebody teach you to teach them grammar when they can get it for free on google on the internet ?
and ill go to youtube .
now i know there a lot of influencers out there who are making money from that .
but usually they are making money not because they are selling the class .
it is because they have some great grammar lesson that are free and they make money from the advertising .
but they are not trying to exaggerate .
you are a agree .
and wrong there a question from the follower .
can i ask it ?
i will divert into the screen .
brack is asking how do you blend culture and realize context into language teaching ?
i am going to have to turn that question around in is how do you not deal with culture and you are doing language teaching ?
because language is about culture .
and if you are teaching english this becomes more difficult because it doesnt make a difference if you are doing arabic or spanish or german .
german is the most widely spoken language in europe .
on the continent .
english is there is german a language forunk there english a language forunk spanish .
look how many country spanish is spoken in .
there many .
and if you look at spanish id to start with spanish .
not everyone who speaks spanish share the same culture .
not everyone who speaks arabic share the same culture .
not everyone who speaks english share the same culture .
you do need to understand cultural aspect of language .
and learning about learning a new language is definitely going to open your eye to how other culture work how people see themselves .
you can not separate the two .
you can not try to do that .
but i think it make for a very dry learning experience because culture is a very integral part of language learning .
and teacher make that decision for themselves whether they are going to teach british english .
and i always think that thats strange because if you are going to teach british english have you lived in a country ?
what do about the culture ?
is it theoretical ?
i think i am always shocked if how many people have these idea of the united state but it is all from hollywood movie .
it is not reality when they start to realize what it is .
they are shocked in a lot of way .
ive traveled throughout the north africa in the middle east .
and i know that there a big difference between morocco and egypt saudi arabia and united arab emirate these are different culture .
and a lot of them in under their different dialect of arabic .
youve got to know about culture .
and you should always teach about culture and not the difference that we have but the similarity that we have a to .
i think thats important .
thank you .
thank you very much for the answer .
let move to another another question for one .
ron how do yourself in ten year ?
will you still be doing this job or are you going to throw in other job ?
i noticed that there somebody there in her name is grace .
i noticed that we came to something .
and grace life in mexico .
shes from argentina .
and i lived in work in mexico .
and i have a home in the united state .
i have a home in spain .
i have a home in germany a . i hope that if everything go to plan i will definitely enjoy my retirement and travel to my different home .
and definitely make sure that i get a house a . a little apartment in mexico .
it is part of what i to do .
and i am going to probably retire in a few year .
but i do not think i am going to quit teaching .
i think thats somebody blood after a while .
i that .
but i know ill probably do webinars still .
but germany cold .
and i do not the winter here .
thats what i our house in spain .
and it is getting our my house in the united state in texas .
it is very hot there .
i do not think i am going to retire there .
but definitely what travel .
i think maybe even in five year i am going to enjoy my retirement .
there also another comment there from anthony .
i know antonio is a friend .
he say thank you to you .
and for the thing that you have taught him .
it is a wonderful to see this comment here .
and let me ask you another question room .
it is sometimes people whod to have in some difficult situation all irish i could have that superpower and to deal with this problem with people sadist .
when you think about yourself if you could have one superpower to use in the class victor a a teacher what would it be and how would it help you ?
i think i wish i could have a superpower of mind reading .
that i could read the mind of my learner and understand them .
not because i want to know everything about them but definitely well to know whats in their mind ?
what did they want ?
because our learner do not always express what they want .
and all the year that ive had in experience in the classroom what they say to you might not be what they want .
and i think if you had the superpower of mind reading that you are able you do not need to do what need analysis .
i think you should start going with what they want .
yeah what they need .
the learner do not always know what they need .
theyll tell you what they want .
but what they want is not always what they need .
and also getting into the mind of people to understand how what is important to get motivated into the learning process .
i think it is a lot easier with adult .
i think anyone who a primary school teacher i do not think that we a other teacher recognize the very difficult job that they have .
because they are doing more than teaching .
they are socializing young people .
their job is different than what we do in secondary school and at the university or the corporate world .
it is important to i said we are talking about superpower here .
i definitely would to be able to give you a reminder of my own .
thank you .
thank you very much for your superpower to tell us. . and by the way two question left .
the time fly from this the wonderful moment we are having here .
thanks to you .
and let me ask you the first question before the last one .
let finish this interview and you step outside the home and find a lot of ticket and up with the ten million what would you do ?
first of all chen nili is not very much money .
i think money is good .
it wa not a long money. . but i probably would give half a bit away .
but do not need that much money .
you i already planted my tree and already have my car and have my house .
and i thought it is not a if i need to buy a new furniture or anything nothing that .
i probably would get a personal trainer and i am nutritionist and a cook to cook for me in my retirement .
but i know probably i would probably give half of it away .
and i know where i would give it away too .
but it would all be to people who one thing i learned during corona is i did not realize everybody think germany a very rich country .
and it is .
it is the economic powerhouse of europe .
but there are still a lot of people here in germany who do not have access to the internet who do not have a laptop who do not have an iphone .
here we are talking on an iphone .
i am talking to you for my iphone .
but corona made me open my eye to that and i worked on a project to make sure that we could get a many laptop to a many teenager a possible to make sure they had the same chance to learn a everybody else .
and that wa an eyeopening experience for me .
i think that we should not forget that no matter where we live at there going to be people who need to have access to the internet need the equipment and we need to do what we can to help them .
and not in the sense that i pity them but because i want to give to people what wa given to me i to get back what wa given to me .
ive met a lot of great people in my life whove been great mentor great teacher and they gave a lot to me .
and when i am in the classroom i try to remember them .
and i know that one of my mentor i do not think she ever let me pay for lunch .
she always paid out of her own money .
sort it it would be giving back .
if i am on the ten million yes i would probably give after that .
thank you .
and here is the last question and i think the the real difficult one .
and what is your motto ?
if you follow me on social medium you probably should already know the answer to that question .
and i believe that when you are grown up and act a grownup that youve got to be critical about thing .
youve got to scrutinize thing .
youve got to break thing down and ask question and not accept everything thats thrown at you .
and if you make decision for your own selfdevelopment and personal growth .
and this is why i have on my linkedin side learning for the discernment .
because we need to be more discerning about what we learn and what we need to learn and make good decision in that way .
and thats my motto is learning for the discerning .
ive made some mistake in decision that ive made for myself about learning .
but i think ive made more good decision than bad decision .
i think the bad decision were based on i made them in the last minute .
do think about it .
and the one that i think about i do it .
i consider myself a discerning person .
and i think we a teacher need to be discerning about our learning .
thats my motto .
learning for that sir .
this learning .
thank you .
thank you very much ron .
thank you very much .
thats all my question ron .
and before ending our last session would you to add anything else ?
i have to thank you for inviting me .

but definitely it wa an a lot of the name that i know .
and if i load to all of you and for those who do not know me follow me on social medium .

hello and welcome to a special podcast about an extraordinary time .
my name is ro taylor and ill be talking to some of the people who helped transform early childhood education in eastern and central europe starting in the 1990s how they did it and what they learned .
well be discussing a new book early childhood education in social and political transition which take an indepth look at the groundbreaking stepbystep programme .
joining me is one of the author sarah klaus who is one of the leader of this open society foundation programme and is now affiliated with georgetown university centre for child and human development .
along with iveta silova associate dean of global engagement at arizona state university .
hello and it is great to be here .
thanks for having u . and also with u is carmen lika director of the stepbystep centre for education and professional development in romania .
thank you .
it is a great pleasure to be here .
let begin at the beginning .
after the fall of the berlin wall george soros decided to make a major investment in early childhood education probably the biggest ever .
that wa the stepbystep programme funded by the open society foundation .
sarah what did he hope to achieve ?
at that time across the region in central eastern europe the open society foundation had a network of independent foundation established in almost every country .
and the aim of these foundation wa to hasten the transformation to vibrant open democratic society .
george soros always invested heavily in education programme and at the time that this programme wa established he wa interested in starting a university .
he wa convinced by dr fraser mustard who ran a social science institute in canada that he needed to be investing in young child in order to transform these society .
there wa incredible brain research coming out at the time and he wa very convinced by that and made a commitment to invest one hundred million in the stepbystep programme .
come in early childhood education wa very different in eastern central europe and eurasia at that time .
give u a sense of what it wa to be a pupil in those classroom to be a small child in those classroom .
it wa different from what we did and what we accomplished with stepbystep .
although early childhood education wa a very strong component of the education system at that time across the eastern bloc it had multiple function and most of them were social function .
both the nursery and the preschool programme provided protection for child and the place for parent to leave their child .
it wa a way that the state freed the parent in order for both mother and father to be able to work .
they mostly provided healthcare and social protection a ive already said and not many child development and learning opportunity .
also it wa a very very big focus in getting the child ready to go to school .
it wa about shaping the child to be behaved and a good citizen but there wa very little emphasis on the child personal development .
yes the individual child did not exist .
it wa a model that all the child had to fit and had to accomplish .
stepbystep drew on the head start programme in the u . sarah tell u about that because you were heavily involved in it .
yes at the time when mr. soros came back from his meeting in canada liz laurent at the open society foundation wa tasked with developing the stepbystep programme and she contacted colleague that she had met at georgetown university who were providing technical assistance to the head start programme .
now head start turned out to be a fantastic model for the stepbystep programme .
it is a programme that emerged a the national programme to support early childhood development under president johnson a part of the war on poverty .
and it is a programme that support holistic childcentered inclusive early childhood development .
and it is a programme that provides the state with block grant to do that and allows them a lot of flexibility .
it wa a great model for stepbystep which we were trying to implement initially in fifteen country and later in thirty country .
in the book a we were doing the interview we asked one question that interested jan very much wa why we did not pick one of the democratic pedagogy in europe of which there are many .
but the head start programme i think wa first of all accessible to the foundation .
but it also had the capacity to do what we needed to do .
we needed to start in fifteen country at once .
we needed thirty trainer .
and it also had a wonderful focus on social justice and inclusivity that underpinned the programme .
yves when you first began to work with stepbystep in central asia what were some of the challenge you encountered ?
central asia wa a fascinating place .
and i wanted to maybe from the very beginning remind everybody that the whole area of the former soviet union eastern central europe is not one homogeneous blog the socialist blog a many people refer to .
but it is a diverse place and with very deep local history and culture and different political trajectory .
and central asia wa a fascinating place to be in .
but it also probably wa one of the most difficult place to work in because the preschool or early childhood education infrastructure wa already fairly modest compared to the other country in the former socialist blog .
but it completely collapsed after the soviet union collapsed .
and maybe the reason one of the reason wa because the early childhood infrastructure wa in large part supported by private industry .
the enterprise owned kindergarten that were very popular .
and during the transition period the privatisation of industry affected also this infrastructure of early childhood education because a enterprise began to be privatised preschool were the first one to be shed and sold off .
the building would be sold off .
and that resulted in very devastating effect for family and for child .
that early childhood education infrastructure probably wa the first one to collapse in this broader education sphere .
and the teacher were leaving because the salary were low .
and it wa quite a dire situation from the get go .
but it also wa a fascinating place to work because on the other hand there wa also a major political will and the desire maybe more broadly among the public to bring back some of this infrastructure ?
that wa important .
that wa i would say that central asia maybe had more political will compared to other context to engage with the step by step programme but also with other education transformation programme and explore all of the possibility that were on the table at that time .
it wa both very dire situation but also an exciting the one with lot of exciting opening .
you found that education minister were quite keen to help you in the end .
wa that why ?
because they were keen to build up this the early childhood infrastructure that had been broken down ?
that wa one of the reason .
i think another reason wa because the philosophy of the step by step also resonated very deeply with many people both academic and politician who were brought up maybe only these more philosophical idea of bigotskis that they recognised almost immediately in a step by step programme a ?
i think there were some element of the programme that resonated immediately and very deeply with academic but also politician in the region .
this ability to connect maybe the key element of the programme with the historical context with some of the maybe philosophical idea that would resonate .
i think step by step had amazing people that were able to make a lot of bridge and lay the ground for successful implementation of the programme .
in the book there a vivid sense of the excitement and purpose around step by step which youve youve alluded to there .
in the early day carmen what wa that to be a part of ?
it wa quite an adventure .
i wa a student and my colleague at that time wa a dentist we were known a the student and the dentist when we first started .
we after the initial training that we participated at in the united state we went to the ministry of education to inform them officially about the programme and the plan and the ministry of education wa a student come to ruin the tradition .
and all the teacher in the first nine preschool who were excited to learn more and to change the practice and what they were doing that they could offer the child they were working with the best opportunity to learn and to reach their full potential .
it wa a curiosity a professional curiosity and desire to do more to do better and to get the child ready for the life that wa opening in front of everybody .
tell u about some of the change that the programme made in these setting .
it changed the whole approach from the teachercentred to the childcentred approach and that wa a real a huge challenge .
i would keep in mind the professional curiosity and desire to learn and change the life of the child .
child with disability and rom child were very much marginalised in the education system in these country .
sarah give u a sense of how they were treated .
there wa a profound structural barrier for both group of child to participate even to participate i will not even say to participate equally in education system .
and for rom child i would say it is even a profound if not more profound but especially there wa an enormous and remains an enormous amount of discrimination against rom child across and here i would say not only central eastern europe but also europe a a whole .
and i do want to emphasise that many country in europe were also around this time trying to figure out how to integrate and include rom child and traveller child for example in the united kingdom where i live now into education system .
rom child many rom child speak a different language at home and they would go to school when they were entering they did not have opportunity to participate in preschool education .
the number of rom child participating in preschool education in the 1990s wa very small .
many child dropped out a because of the discrimination that they experienced in school .
it wa a dire situation .
and to emphasise some of the country that step by step wa working in romania where carmen is bulgaria hungary czech republic slovakia these are country with very high number for high percentage of rom people .
having them not participate in education is hugely detrimental to the whole society .
carmen how did step by step try to change all this ?
it wa introduced a an inclusive program from the very beginning from it very first day to the ministry of education to the county school inspectorate who are the local authority to all the teacher and parent that we worked with .
we understood very quickly that the early childhood is the best entry point to reduce the difference to recognise and reduce the difference in approaching rom and child with disability .
a sara mentioned child with disability were not even considered to be enrolled in regular classroom .
they were either kept at home or enrolled in special classroom .
we made it very clear that we open enrolment for all child with partner with social service in the first nine city we started and that wa a practice that continued .
child with different vulnerability were enrolled in the step by step program while we supported the teacher with training and working with child that come from different cultural background child with disability and we also offered them onsite support coaching besides the training .
the training focused on the democratic value such a inclusion and tolerance and diversity and recognising the difference and understanding that it is to be different .
for young child it wa natural to have different colleague to work to play with different kind of child and it became natural for parent .
and this is how we built a critical mass of people both professional and family and social service that rolled on and moved forward with this idea .
and we came to a point where the ministry of education used to refer parent of child with disability to go to step by step classroom because this is where they will get the best opportunity for their child .
of course there were setback .
not everything changed a much a you wanted it to a quickly a you wanted it to .
i would say that this wa a program of persistence and learning in the fall after the first training took place over the summer when u.s. trainer went back to visit program in central eastern europe .
everybody wa excited .
it wa a huge change in all the classroom but they started to notice that teacher were still asking child who were lefthanded to write with their hand or child were still standing in line to go to the toilet .
they werent being treated a individual .
and we realized that there were still a lot of thing to do .
a new methodology a whole new training package wa created and delivered to support teacher to think about these nuance of democratic education that maybe we hadnt thought about at first .
i would say that we werent able to change everything that we wanted to change but we never stopped trying .
we had a saying who say we can not change the world ?
and that wa the motto that the whole program lived by with this expectation somehow that an education program in early childhood could make a huge difference .
and step by step eventually moved out of preschool and primary school and it sought to influence inservice training and preservice training in university and training college .
sarah how did those institution which had often been doing the same thing for a long time react to that ?
we included representative from the university in all of the training from the beginning but only in small number .
and we realized after a few year that that wasnt going to change the university system and wasnt going to change how teacher were trained .
it wasnt going to change what we call the inservice training system which is how teacher get participate in retraining .
and in the region it wa often every three or four year they would participate in a retraining program .
we started a higher education program part of the persistence program and developed eight semesterlength course for university and then provided those course through training to about twozero people in the across university and pedagogic institute and inservice training institute .
and here i would say i think it inspired individual professional to change their course .
in a few university we know that it inspired a particular certificate program or a change in the training program but it did not have the huge effect that we wanted .
and i think in retrospect maybe we could have focused on specific institution of higher education and focused on training those .
but i do think it changed and introduced some new idea into the academic of early childhood education a a whole .
and i think that that ha served a a foundation for other work going forward .
and in the end you moved far beyond europe and eurasia did not you ?
yeah the program at open society foundation ended up a a global program working around the world .
and the stepbystep program wa one project that wa influential in some of our activity .
i think in the book we write about the work of the open society foundation in bhutan and also in liberia .
i would say that what we learned wa that the program wa hugely influential or had had relevance even in context where the education system wa very different .
i should mention also that the program wa operated from the early year in haiti and for a time also in south africa where open society foundation had and still i think ha national foundation .
this book is a reflection on stepbystep what it did achieve what it did not .
looking back ivetta what might have been done differently ?
this is a huge question and probably another book could be written about this question alone .
but i wanted to pick up maybe on the question on the discussion that sarah started a little bit earlier about the preservice and inservice teacher education in school .
i think this perhaps could be one area that could have been done could have been approached differently ?
but a sarah said it wa a major learning process for the program itself .
but i wanted to point out that this wa a problem that wa very typical for most of the international development project at that time .
many resource in the early 1990s and beyond went into school to offer direct support to teacher and student and offer this very direct immediate assistance on the ground .
and higher education institution became an afterthought in a lot of international development assistance program ?
they were perceived by many people a these black hole where nobody wanted to invest any money because nobody would know what would happen with this money and these huge bureaucracy .
but in a way i think that international development assistance replicated maybe some of the also problem that we have in western europe and north america or western education more broadly which is based on this research to practice divide ?
this logic maybe wa automatically transferred also to international development context ?
where the school and preschool were separated from what wa happening in term of research or in term of teacher education program .
and i think when people started to not only in step by step but in many other program started to realize that school are changing fast .
but preservice teacher training institution are producing exactly the same teacher a they were fifty year ago .
i think this is when this maybe realization became more pronounced and also the urge to address it became more urgent .
but i wonder what would have happened if from the very beginning the teacher and researcher and faculty member in high education institution work together and owned the program and the transformation together a a collective .
i wonder if thing would have been different .
and i think that it wa a unique moment in time because everything seemed to have been thrown up in the air in the early 1990s when many institution were collapsing .
i think it wa a unique opportunity to try something different but we did not but we did it later ?
and i think there were lot of a sarah mentioned earlier opportunity to learn and also opportunity for these western expert who were part of the program to learn how program could be done differently including at home in the united state or in europe .
i think it wa a good learning experience for everybody involved both people in eastern and central europe and the former soviet union but also all of the colleague from the west a . it wa mutual wasnt one way .
carmen you run an ngo which wa established through the stepbystep program .
what wa your experience of setting it up ?
that wa a learning and growth experience .
we had a change in management of the national soros foundation in late one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven .
and when the new management team came in they called me and they said you have about three month to put together an ngo .
i did not have experience in running ngo developing ngo .
i put together a team of people and we had to go through a legislation that dated at that time from one thousand nine hundred and twenty four in romania .
that wa how the civil society organization were legally organized .
and we started early one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight .
probably the biggest challenge throughout the whole process wa to keep expanding the stepbystep program and maintaining the high quality of the program while developing the ngo and building a strategy for the ngo a a whole not only for the program .
and that wa one of the biggest challenge .
i am very grateful for all the support that we received from the early childhood program with all the training and the coach and the mentor and the resource and also from the national foundation .
i think it wa a learning opportunity for everybody .
and where is stepbystep in romania now ?
it is an ngo celebrating twenty five year of existence and thirty year of stepbystep .
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four we started with the preschool program .
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five we were amongst the few one who said yes to the parent who wanted their child to continue in stepbystep program and we started with one classroom of primary school program .
and the number of group of preschool classroom and primary school classroom ha grown steadily ever since .
we are now active in six hundred kindergarten nationwide and over onezero primary school classroom .
we also adapted the stepbystep principle and value to public school who wanted to transform themselves in stepbystep school .
we are also working with the first five big university in romania in developing a course on alternative education .
stepbystep program is officially recognized in romania since one thousand nine hundred and ninety five a an educational alternative .
and we are also working with the national association of the pedagogical high school which are the institution who train the educational professional for nursery .
this is in a nutshell where stepbystep is now in romania .
it is everywhere in other word almost everywhere .
and we also i think we were very very involved in advocating and designing the legislation for early childhood in romania .
eveta you mentioned earlier this is a stepbystep is a remarkable example of eastwest policy borrowing .
what did you personally learn from it ?
stepbystep is a fascinating case study .
for anybody who interested in comparative education i think this would be a interesting case to explore by reading the book which ha many excerpt from interview with different stakeholder that were involved .
it wa listening to a lot of familiar voice to me when i wa reading .
it is a great case study .
but i think that and there are many lesson that could be learned from it but for me personally let me step back for a second .
policy borrowing and lending is often critiquing this prepackaged education reform that are transferred from the west to the east or north to the south .
but i think this case of stepbystep program is interesting where the reform ha been transferred but it ha been extremely adaptable and on an ongoing basis adapting to the local context ?
changing in response to the concern or the interest of the local stakeholder and community ?
much more i would say open ended and reflective program that kept learning a it wa going a sarah mentioned also earlier and carmen a . i think also what it program showed is that this borrowing process is not one way transfer ?
but it is an ongoing mutual learning process where both the called quoteunquote expert and the local stakeholder learn together and create something new in the process .
but i think maybe one of the most interesting lesson to me wa how this program created dense network of academic and practitioner not only regionally but also on a worldwide scale ?
now we have you can see collaboration that are happening across the four socialist region .
you can see collaboration that are happening worldwide .
it ended up changing the culture of education and created these absolutely powerful network that exist now and that continue to advocate for policy change for even broader cultural change in the context where they are working .
sarah open society ha stopped funding step by step but the program left an indelible mark on the country that took part a a on europe and eurasia a a whole .
do you still see the step by step imprint there ?
i think one of the big achievement of the program wa developing or supporting the development of a vibrant civil society in early childhood education and development .
and it is become the goto professional association in the field and is advocating and holding on to the value that underpinned and underpinned the step by step program when it wa established in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three one thousand nine hundred and ninety four .
and we see element of the program woven in .
and i think these network also helped knit together east and west europe in a early childhood education academic sense .
i think thats also been a important part of the program .
and i think also one that show how eastern europe can lead in bringing those academic and practitioner community together which is not always seen .
i think a ivette wa mentioning we also often see this idea of western europe coming and doing thing with eastern europe .
but this wa an example of eastern europe taking an initiative and seeing it through to create something for all of europe and eurasia .
it is been a fascinating and quite inspirational discussion .

ive man my life is filled with much favor .

and then when i look around when i take a moment you say the pause and look at where i am i am i am amazed by all i got some step to my front door at my house .
and when i pull up at night and i pull my car and front of them step there thirty three step up to my front door .
eleven step then it is a platform eleven more platform landing and then eleven more downstairs at door .
and i call them that my thank you jesus step .
because when i am going up to them step man i thank him them whole time i am walking up to step .
now keep in mind now this is the end of the night .
i am beat i did not done a full radio show that day .
i did not done a full day of family feud and you are on your foot all day and i am walking up to him step .
and it is and i call them that thank you jesus step .
and i say it every time because the house i live in i i professed that house .
i got halfway up to those step and turned around and looked back at the fountain and i said man one day one day i am going to get a fountain that .
and for a call ill visit and buddy of mine at that house. ?
and i stopped and i turned around .
he said man stop i can crazy .
come on i said man you got to be kidding me man .
and thats the house i live in today .
but you used to visit that house .
i used to visit that house .
i saw the house when it wa being built .
i wa i wa a part of it .
and i saw that house when it wa being built .
and i told my wife i said one day and she told me she said see not this house .
we can not do this .
we are going down side when the kid move .
and i do not know what downside in this for .
because i do not know how you get god to give you more and then you give it back .
i aint never been into that .
they are saying my thing .
i had a guy on my show of clark howard and this aint nothing negative .
but he on the show .
kept telling everybody how to cut back .
cut your cable off to save money .
instead of driving your car to work car poo .
and i sent that for about a month .
i listened to that and i couldnt take it no more .
because i am doing the cutback business .
i am in the if god blessed me i to keep the blessing .
i am a wife told me we wa going down side .
and that wa the first major argument we ever had because i am not in the downside and business .
yeah they did not seem your personality .
i do not see a wife .
whats the cremvious place youve ever lived ?
you think back to the can you think of the cremvious place youve ever lived ?
yeah what car wasnt ?
i do not suppose it wa new .
that wouldve been nice .
i lived in that and i lived in a bonneville .
that wa the worst place .
i when i think back in a poorest place ive lived a a house i grew up in .
but at the time i did not know that .
it wa poor for the course .
it wa one of the house on the block .
everybody lived that .
i thought it wa i thought this how you live .
you thirteen people in one bathroom room .
you are not thought that wa it .
but because you did not know any different at the time .
because i wa saying i grew up poor .
but at the time if youve never ridden anything but at fifty eight volkswagen if youve never been in a cadillac you do not know the difference ?
you think this is the way it is .
hey who went to church in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight bell last stationway ?
and that wa my first car in seventy five .
my daddy gave me a one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight bell last stationway .
and that wa my first car .
hey it wa a car went to church in it. . you were born in west virginia .
and it wa that wa not a real affluent time in your life .
but there were seventy all ?
how many kid were in your family ?
it wa five kid .
there were seven in the family .
did everybody work in contribute when you were growing up ?
yeah that wa a must .
wouldnt have free rise in my daddy house .
when you we did not have a lot of thing tough that .
ive had a ive had paper route .
and and pop bottle hustle every since i wa ten .
ive wondered many time if thats the reason you and i got along fast .
because weve talked about before and i threw paper route .
i picked up pop bottle and you get a nickel for some and you get a dime for others .
and put them together .
and weve had some of those same experience .
i do not know about you but i would not want my kid to go through that .
but i do not mind that i did .
it is with me that i went through that at the time .
i wouldnt want to do it again .
but and i wouldnt want my kid to do it .
you look at everything youve gone through .
i used to oftentimes question god all the time man .
why is my life this ?
a i got older when i wa a kid it wasnt the question .
but when i got older and homeless and all thats a god what is this about man ?
look come on .
enough is enough .
but everything you are going through is preparing you for whats to come .
you and i needed the pop bottle moment the paper route .
you and i needed that .
we could become who we are .
now we grew up and we do not want our child to have that .
they do not have to go through the same thing that we went through .
and then thats a challenge i find for a lot of people who are doing better now .
because you give much to your kid that they miss some of them valuable lesson that you had to learn along the way .
and then you start thinking to yourself did i give them too much ?
whats the cutoff point ?
and i rattle with that all the time with my kid .
because my kid did not fight on the way .
my kid went to school with a jacket that had a patch on it .
with the blue shirt and uniform .
they got the merit .
and they went to detention .
and it wa over with for me .
school over with for me my detention that the mayor wa somebody had to demere it waiting on me in the playground .
because when the bail rang i am kicking some tail .
and yours is it today ?
my kid did not have to go through that because they had a room with a bathroom with it .
they owned bathroom .
yeah they are owned bathroom .
i one of the thing that you told me long time ago we talked about it on on microphone one time that ha stuck with me .
and ive told a lot of people about it .
you had when you got older and got out into comedy you told me about what you called your turnback moment .
when you you were living in an addict .
and it wa a turnback moment that and i wish you would talk about that a little bit .
because it seems to me that you were within hour of having to go back home and get back into an hourly job instead of going to the apollo .
because no look man i said it before .
everybody i do not kill who you are is going to have that turnback moment .
everybody is on path on track to a destination .
everybody nobody is without dream and vision .
but somewhere along that dream of vision you are going to have a moment where you can either continue or you turn back .
the sad truth of the matter is too many people turn back .
my turnback moment wa i wa out there doing comedy .
i wa homeless .
and i had had enough that day .
and i wa washing up in a hotel .
and i wa in there and i used to go to fancy hotel to wash up because they had actual wash clothes rolled up in a little basket .
and i used to wet them and take them in the toilet and put soap all over my body .
and i went to the coast clear and i went to the coast clear and i went to the mountain and go back in there and wipe off and then put my clothes on .
and that wa my bath .
that morning a convention wa in town .
when i got to soap i went in there to soap up .
a convention wa in town and i guess they had let out for a break and people kept coming in the bathroom and i am sitting there .
and i got this soap on me and it is drying .
and i can not get back out there to get no fresh get no fresh cloth to wash. and the soap is drying on me and i flipped the toilet lid down and i sat there and i started cry .
i said this is it man .
i can not do this no more .
this comedy thing aint working out .
i aint making enough money to take care of my family .
i am gon na call my father told me once you leave here you can not come back home .
call my own man and cut a deal with him .
see if he let me come back home for six month and get me a regular job .
let me give up on this comedy thing .
and when they are bathroom finally cleared out i wa able to wash off .
i went to get in the car and before i called my daddy i had an answering machine up in the attic at my mother and father house .
they let me plug up and i called that answering machine and i wa about to give up and i said i called the machine and it said hey this is chuck sutton from show time with your apollo .
i saw a tape of you and i wa wondering if you can make it to new york on sunday and i put you on tv .
your funny guy hoped to hear from you .
this wa a thursday .
i got thirty five dollar and the apollo theater in harlem new york .
i am gon na be able to get there .
and all of this time man ive been wanting to be on tv since i wa a kid .
here this tv moment and i can not even get there .
and man i wa devastated .
i said god look at this guy to be a sign from god show enough to give up now .
because i get to one crack to be on tv and i can not even get there .
i set out in the car man and tear is coming down my face man .
let me go and call my father .
now went back and i said man let me call him and make sure he did not say this sunday .
and i call back hey this is chuck sutton from showtime at the apollo man .
i got an openknit on showtime at the apollo sunday night of you can make it .
please give him a call man you are funny guy .
it is this sunday .
and i wa about to hang up and the old fashioned machine they said poop it beat the game .
i picked up the phone .
he say steve harvey this is tom sober from the comedy caravan .
i do not know where you are but i got to gig and jack some vehicle floated it pay one hundred and fifty buck .
if you can get there the gig is friday night .
ill pay one hundred and fifty buck .
let me know .
i call tom sober said man i can get there .
i got there friday night .
i made the one hundred and fifty buck .
the club owner said hey can you stick around tomorrow night ?
i pay another one hundred and fifty .
i got three hundred now .
i get on that phone and i call showtime at the apollo chuck said and i say hey man you still got that opening .
he said yeah i got that opening man .
i said ill be there .
eastern airline wa in business back then because ninety nine .
flopher jacksonville new york i called it ninety nine .
the flight my first time ever on tv showtime at the apollo .
i still got to shirt .
i walked out .
i got a stand in ovation .
i can not stop cry .
and i thought about it .
and the reason i couldnt stop cry because two day ago i wa finna turn back .
two day ago i wa finna call my daddy and give up .
two day ago had that happened .
i am not here talking to you today .
and that turned back moment man that gave me the faith and understand and how god work .
but if you are hanging there you do not know who in god going flip the switch .
and he flipped the switch ?
because he saw me finna call .
he knew i wa serious .
he said this dude finna give up .
but he had orchestrated the whole thing .
and i did not turn back .
and that moment changed my life .
because when i got on tv on showtime to apollo that wa to be getting everything .
man ive been on tv every six .
you hung in and you did not do it .
and that three hundred buck you could have taken that and gone home .
but man thats why i say to people all the time .
quit and guarantee you one thing .
it aint going to happen .
thats the guarantee of quitting .
hang in there .
resides this little thing thats required .
all you need is a check the hope .
the hope .
faith is the substance of thing hopeful and the evidence of thing not seen .
all you hope thats all faith is .
it is hope .
and the harder you hope the more faith you got the more faith you have the more faith you have .
but you got to put a lot of elbow grease with it too .
i want to ask you let take a quick break .
and then ive got to ask you a question that play into what you are saying .
and it is about something i want to tell you that stephen i have in common here in a minute .
and i want to do a shameless plug again from merit street medium because it is a new network where the rubber meet the road .
this is not a new network .
it is a revolution in common sense television .
and it is straight from the heart of america to you .
look this is a network thats founded on the principle of meritocracy .
and thats what you heard steve harvey talking about before we took this break .
meritocracy rewarding hard work rewarding hanging in there .
and it is the spirit of main street .
we are here to deliver content that speaks to you about you and for you .
and dr. phil primetime is the beginning .
we are rolling out the red carpet for show that cover every angle of life a we know it from family and relationship to the burning issue that are shaping our world today .
and if you are ready for television thats a real a you are .
it is time to tune in to merit street medium .
because this is our story .
this is not our story to tell .
it is yours too .
this is not my network .
this is our network .
let make television that matter .
and let make it together .
i want you to discover a whole new era in television with merit street medium .
this is not a lot of other network where there one show .
and then you go to the next show .
and they do not have any to do with each other .
weve created a whole new ecosystem here where the news is involved with my show .
and my show is involved with nancy grace show .
and nancy grace show is involved with the behavior panel .
all the show are involved with each other .
and steve harvey is going to have something to say about that in a few minute .
to get involved go to meritstreatmedia.com to find your local channel .
there a channel finder there .
and youll see exactly what i am talking about .
this is a passion for me .
and i think when you tune in you are going to see why .
but i do not want you to tune in .
i want you to call everybody and tell them about it .
ive written a new book called weve got issue how to stand strong for america soul and sanity .
and it is the blueprint for this entire network .
it is a blueprint for our news .
it is a blueprint for dr. phil primetime .
it is a blueprint for everybody involved in this network because we have shared value .
and i think youll share them too when you tune in .
now steve you were talking about faith being hope and real hard .
but you put action with that too .
and you said you wouldnt be sitting here today if it wasnt for that .
ive been friend for a long time ?
and i said before we talked about some thing that we can not talk about with anybody else because there are very many people that do what we do .
we are both out there every day .
we are in people home every day .
people feel they know u because we are in their home every day .
you are in my home almost all day every day .
i think you were in my house one time .
i pulled up the record guide .
i think we had what four hundred and thirty episode of family feud recorded .
because robin record them all .
and watch u them all .
and people see you .
and you are you have a great gift for humor and banner with people .
you go back and forth with them .
thats why family feud is it is got to be the most successful game show that ever .
i do not know if anything else ha had the longevity youve brought to it the energy everything that youve brought to it .
because you are authentic with the people. ?
you do not know you do not have a clue what you are going to say when you walk out there .
because you do not know what they are going to say .
you let yourself come through .
and thats a big part of all the comedy youve ever done .
ive seen your stand up .
ive seen everything you do .
and you have comedy that you work out where the beat are timed .
and they are exactly what they need to be .
but a big part of it is you interacting with the audience .
where do you get the confidence to do that ?
i do not know if it is the confidence a more is though .
look man authenticity is a big part of our brand .
mine and yours .
i think thats a big part of our friendship over the year .
it is authenticity .
i couldnt believe it wa another dude in the business that wa what real dude .
you couldnt believe it wa another dude in the business .
that wa a real dude .
because what we want to be into out here .
you got your brand manager you got your pr person you got your attorney .
you got all these people being stuffed to their toll to be .
you aint never been that .
and i aint never been that .
i i they call me a country bumpkin in all .
what you i am from whats whats virginia what you want me to be ?
what whats what you want me to do ?
you can not i am not finished speaking grammatically correct .
i got high school diploma .
that wa it .
graduate in class of six hundred and ninety five .
i graduated six hundred and ninety .
you werent after bottom ?
and five people out after me .
i gave them the blue when i saw them too .
i tried to encourage them hanging at the dog you could six hundred and ninety four and ride around the corner .
i tried to be on the moment .
but it wa an authenticity man .
i can not fake the funk man .
i can not hold the line .
and if i am out here faking man i am not going to be able to hold the line .
i aint going to be already know that .
because the real me going to come out .
see it is starting to funny man .
if i do not you i i stay on the other side .
and me and you do not need to talk .
because it is going to come out .
because i am not going to be able to hide the fact that i do not care for you .
because the moment you say some contrary to what i am going to hear did not hear it come .
i am going to let you have it in the teeth .
and ive always been that way .
i wanted to stay authentically me .
and i think people responded to that .
i noticed why youve been on tv for long man .
i told you but my favorite moment on tv i wa watching your on tv talk to this guy .
and you frustrated with this dude .
and he wa whining .
and you say man you are you are going to have to man up .
and i went .
you could feel the brake going .
he going to get some call on that one there .
a lot of email coming in .
dr. fielding insulted him by telling him he needed to man up .
man that made all the sense in the world of me .
and thats pretty much how i try to be .
when i turned that corner at family feud you said i never met these people .
i do not know who they are .
i try to be relatable .
but if i can not relate i am going to tell you that part too .
it wa interesting to me in watching that unfold .
because if you remember you and marjorie were at our house the night you had to make the decision of whether to do family feud or not .
you were thinking about talking about it .
we were back in my office .
and that wa a night .
it wa a deadline .
you had to tell him whether you are going to do it or not .
and they were pushing you hard .
and we talked about the fact that the game show the game part of it .
thats part of it .
you said it is a survey .
but it gave you a chance to be you .
the game is a backdrop .
it wa a platform for you to be who you are .
and let them keep score .
you go down the line .
and you it is you work in the front row of a comedy show. . thats all it is .
man family feud a huge part of his success is i i turned it into a comedy show instead of a guy .
and nobody had ever done that with a game show .
a game show ha a set format and thats it .
family feud is a game about a survey .
top one hundred people survey said here would they think who care ?
i am and ill tell you what wa making me have that trouble at your house that night .
they had sent me a tape of the guy before me .
and the question wa do you send me a tape for me to see the show ?
name your favorite pet and the guy said a cow .
and the whole said let see if it is up there .
and i said to myself here you talking about what do you mean let see if it is up there ?
you want to say it doll puppy cat chicken fish bird turtle .
some people got who got a cow walking around they live in room ?
the lady said you would say that to the contestant ?
yeah i am not going to turn and say let see if it is up there .
the first of all i know what aint up there .
and thats second lady find out why you thought that ignorant answer would be up here .
she said you can not make disparaging remark against the contestant .
watch me .
who i am my tape ?
lady i am an observational humorist expert .
i made an observation that you say in a stupid answer .
what i do is i now say what everybody had to house this thinking .
and thats what i did .
and man they told me that will not happen .
and you told me you said man why do not you go in there and be you ?
and i said and then i took the gig and that wa it .
that wa it .

and i went thats where you are going to go with it now .
and that wa it .
and then he sent a stuff over and i couldnt believe it man .
and all honesty this is what you call favor .
this is man when you are going along and god do a solid for you .
this one you this is see i can not give nobody credit for this .
it is up god because it wa no doing a man .
i say he what you are working on now .
i got to call out of nowhere it wa you look we see each other on vacation .
do call me and here i want to do this with you .
and the reason i called you and a ive said to you nobody else .
there not anybody else on the list .
is this you and me ?
thats it .
because i said i take this real serious .
and there is you and i have a very a line value system from the very beginning .
and i am going to sound mutual admiration society for a few minute here .
but people know you from what you do and what they see on the air .
but i know you a a real person .
i know you a a husband and a father and a real person away from the camera and who you are and what you believe and what youve struggled to overcome .
and i know who you are and i know how much you have to offer to this country and keeping this country on track and online .
and i did not name this network by accident .
i did not reach into a bag and pull out a name merit .
this is merit street medium .
a and i think this country is built on hard work and talent and added value .
and i know that about you .
ive known that about you for year and year and year .
and it is not about being a victim .
it is about second it up and doing what you got to do to get ahead .
and that defines you .
you and ive talked about it a hundred time .
and i know what father you are .
i know what family man you are .
i know ive seen you in march .
we vacation together .
weve had serious conversation .
weve problem off together .
weve fought them off at the gate together .
i thought this is somebody that we have shared life experience and shared value .
and i said man this is somebody that ill go into fox hole with .
and thats why i picked up a phone call to you .
and man i appreciate man you talk about how thing have gone in this country and everything .
the symbol for this country is an eagle ? .
all the foreign eagle and fly proper .
you got to have a wing and a left wing .
i do not go all the way with what nobody say .
i am not the far guy .
and i show it to fall left guy .
because i to get it man where i care about my family .
i care about my grandchild .
i care about my kid man .
and i am trying to figure out the world that they are going to be in .
and if we keep going at the pace we are going .
got to taste something my son linder wa crazy to me .
because we have the issue now .
we got all this pro now picking .
thats cool .
but this wa a guy i saw this online that made me a laugh but it threw me .
had a little boy in front of this table and they put two oreo cooky in front of me and put five hundred on the other side and told u little boy to pick .
all the boy looking at them cooky and looking at five hundred and let me tell you something .
he wa good at it because he did not cook it .
and that five hundred .
they doubled down and they put four oreo cooky in front of me one thousand .
i saw this little boy .
he had made up his mind .
the ripping wa over .
it is a done deal .
he picked them for cooky .
he wa through .
he wa solved it for me .
the money on the cooky .
and then a lady came up and said and this is why kid do not need to be picking a sex at school .
and i laughed but that hit me a hammer man .
i am gon na say what are we going with all this ?
hold up man .
we got slow down a little bit .
because this little boy clearly took them for cooky .
he a thousand .
it is a thousand wa here .
you do not know the thousand .
you could have bought how many pack of cooky .
you could have got a bike .
boy you could have got your sister new school .
you could have bought the girl down and straight some cooky .
you could have bought the girl and scout box of cooky .
how many girl you had after that ?
that boy picked them for cooky .
and i said man thats what we got to start thinking about .
and man i am with everybody making whatever decision they want to make .
but you got to be when somebody ha a counter now .
you got to be with a counter too .
if youve free to think and feel thats fine and then .
but you got to be open to the counter now .
because you can not publicly think and feel one way and expect publicly not to be thought of another way .
and i look at stuff that man .
and i think it is a fair to be able to talk about stuff that and say it out loud without you say without cancellation .
because i am trying to cancel nobody .
you and a dope person man .
do you but we got to take a shot look at where we let in our kid go .
i couldnt agree more .
and i think that we are in a real bad spot when we can not ask question without getting labeled a a hater or some foe .
we are in a real bad spot when we have people afraid to speak there .
mind or ask question or disagree for fear that they are going to get canceled .
and i always thought about college is somewhere you went to hear other idea .
or you went to the town square back in the old day where you had different point of you and you went to hear what they were .
now thats not the case .
if somebody disagrees they get shouted down .
they call it the hechlers veto .
they are going to shut you down where they do not hear the other side .
and what i want to do at merit street is i want u to own the debate lane .
look this is where you can come to talk about both side of an issue and then let people make up their own mind .
thats what i want our news department to do .
you turn on one cable news and you hear everything on the wing .
you are on the other hand you hear everything .
and left wing .
here a novel approach .
let tell people what happened and shut up .
tell them what happened and then shut up .
let them make up their mind about whether it is good news or bad news .
it is an insult to people .
we do not need to tell people what to think .
we need to tell people how to think .
we do not teach kid how to think anymore .
we do not teach critical thinking .
let teach kid how to think .
instead of what to think .
let them decide what they think .
let teach them how to do critical thinking .
let them decide what to do .
they do not need to be told what to think .
thats whats happening in college now .
we are teaching kid what to think instead of how to think .
we need to teach them how to go through the thought process .
thats whats important .
i want to be able to look man .
if you have a different subappinion from me i am fine with that .
i am cool with that man .
you do not have to think me .
i aint got to think you either .
and hold on man .
i am going to allow you to say what you want to say .
but can i not be allowed to say what i want to say ?
now what i want to say is not lined up with you .
why i got to bite the bullet ?
why you got to cancel my show ?
because it did not line up with what you said .
thats the trouble that we have in now man .
and it seems that cancellation thing is winning now .
yeah but i think you are starting to be a swing back .
and i certainly hope thats the case .
must go to do another commercial here .
this is live .
i got to do another commercial across this great country .
from coast to coast youve told me about the crossroad we are facing .
what steve wa talking about .
thats exactly why i wrote .
how you can stand strong for america soul insanity .
now this book is not a conversation starter .
it is a road map for standing strong in the face of adversity .
for embracing our core value when they are needed most .
now we are talking about real strategy for real people dealing with real issue .
and i am talking about from navigating the complexity of today polarized world to fortifying our family .
and i think that family in america are under attack now .
weve got to focus on strengthening our family .
and i set forth in the book ten principle that i think are critical for a healthy society .
this is not about politics .
do not want to be a politician .
do not know enough about politics to talk about it .
i think most people that talk about politics do not know enough about politics to talk about it .
i am willing to admit it .
i do not know enough about it .
but i talk about cultural issue because i do know about that .
and i think that if people want to have a conversation about that this is a place for them to go .
and we are going to be you and i are going to be doing a lot of thing that i think impact the family .
weve got one great project coming up that i love .
we are going to be doing a thing that youve been at for a long time .
we are going to put it on television and hopefully inspire people because you work with young men that do not have father in their world .
they do not have father in their life .
and we are going to do .
we are going to shoot a retreat about that .
we are going to do that in georgia .
yeah you are going to do that at my ranch down in georgia .
it is going to be a great man because it this is what i need .
because i need people to understand the severity .
we talk about it is one thing to discus a problem .
it is a whole other thing provide a solution for it ?
if you work for me and you come to me and you go mr. harvey we have an problem here .
if you do not have to fix for it please do not bring me the problem .
please do not do that to me .
because i got enough .
i got stuff stacked up to here .
if i want to hear whats going wrong i do not need you to come in here unless you have a fix .
we have a problem with our young men today .
my my foundation ha worked with young girl marjorie doe the girl and i do the boy .
and this is my 14th or 15th year doing this .
and we ive done over three thousand young men at the ranch personally .
ive done three million virtually every since covid .
three million young men .
ive done three thousand life that i bring to my ranch .
and what i do is i bring young men to my ranch who do not have active father in their life .
they are from single parent home headed up by woman because i know the daunting task that woman have in raising a young boy .
because how do you get this woman to possibly turn this boy into a man ?
thats got to be tough when youve never been one .
i offer my assistance .
and i get thousand and thousand of request every year .
this year will have three hundred boy .
our tv network is coming down there this year .
itll be the week leading up to father day weekend .
i picked father day because they do not have them .
and i bring a lot of men down there .
it is all men volunteer all male speaker to put the image in front of these young boy they need .
and i teach them two thing in the five day that i have them .
first of all a flying ball in that coming from fifteen different city this year .
i fly them all in a housing .
i put them up .
i feed them and i clothing .
now these young boy learn two thing .
the principle of manhood and dream building .
and i got some pushback from certain corporation .
what about the education ?
some of these kid go to college .
some of these kid go to the army .
some of these kid go work at home .
where and load .
i got all type of stuff .
that aint my job .
i am trying to say these young boy life .
i am trying to turn boy .
i am trying to turn these boy into better men .
and if i can teach them the principle of manhood to get them to understand who it .
that manhood is not a video in any chain .
it aint to size the old room .
it aint some girl in the background shaking .
that aint got nothing to do with manhood .
real men go to work .
real men obey the law .
real men respect woman .
real men go to work every day .
see i got to get that in their head .
and if you give them to me for five day i got a program thats set in stone that is proven to have maximized result .
i have turned out of this program .
young men who are in the military .
young men who are manager in department store .
ive turned out young men who are engineer .
ive got minister from this program .
ive got young men who are in medical school .
ive got many college student .
ive got the track record to show you that if you put a dream in front of these young boy and teach them how to dream .
see the dream will inspire you to get an education .
thats the problem we have .
see we keep beating these boy over the head .
come on go to school go to school .
let talk about the dream .
i had a young boy four year ago came to the camp and told me he will not defy our plane .
he wa a d student .
today is young men a a pilot .
because once you told me that you will not defy plane i put some pilot in front of him .
i got him to go down and get on the airplane with some pilot .
and they talked to him where he found out .
i got to do better in school because i am not need to be good at science and math .
because i put the dream in front of him .
i had two boy that wa gang banger .
and these cat wa at it man .
there crypt in the blood .
and these two boy are couldnt separate you .
every time they saw each other them two little color rig wa at it .
now one of the little boy i couldnt save .
and i can not tell you where he is today .
but one of the young boy come back to the camp .
he one of my top junior counselor .
and he an engineer today .
see i aint gon na save everybody .
i aint no miracle work .
but the church aint saving everybody either .
but i can get most of these boy on track .
and out of the three thousand thats come to the camp .
out of the three thousand ive only lost one .
who wouldnt stay at the camp .
and when you come down there there some of field .
and you bring these camera .
and we get a real light on this .
maybe somebody would turn around and help me with this .
because i spent a lot of money on this ranch .
myself marjorie and bartit and donated it to the foundation for one .
i could change these boy life down in barnesville georgia .
and look i got a build .
some dormitory now .
i put up temporary housing with tent .
and i bring in the of vip shower .
and all this on movie set .
they can get up .
but i got a build .
dormatory is down there .
i got a build a theater down there .
i want to build a stem center down there .
i want to build a gymnasium .
maybe some people understand what they are doing .
i do want people to see it .
we got a video of any of this .
this is what i live for .
this one god made before .
all that frame for you .
i live for this .
i could teach somebody else .
or i saw you over there .
how many boy at the time ?
two two three hundred each year .
each year .
all at the same time .
all at the same time .
it is a truck load man .
and how old are they ?
from thirteen to eighteen .
and how do they how do they sign up ?
how do you pick the one that come ?
they write a letter. . they write a letter .
that let u know if they interested in .
sometimes the one i pick .
i pick mostly trouble youth .
we got some straight a student down there .
do not have a father active in their life .
and then i got some cat and they doing at all .
thats usually who i pick .
i want that little boy that looked that they trying to write him off and tell him he aint gon na be nothing .
because i heard that before .
and thats what we get .
and how long do they stay ?
they stay about four day for that .
and they are all i need to ingrain them .
see it is real easy man .
because to get to a boy i know the way .
first of all i want to know what you are dreaming about .
and then i want to know what type of girl you want .
see once i find that out .
and then i start telling you what this girl going on .
and then thats going to tell you what you are going to need to do .
i have they undivided attention .
because i know what it is done .
it is real simple .
you got to get down the basic .
you talked about all the time .
you talked about common sense tv .
see yall good they going about this and wrong way .
man if school would implement a dream building course they could save they self a lot of trouble .
if you could ask the kid what do you dream about ?
you got to stop and talk to your kid every four month about what they dream about .
if you talk to them about what they dream about what they want in life you have their attention .
but you can not keep beating them over the head .
but you got to go to school .
it wa i do not have a lesson .
now what are you talking about ?
we can not even eat now .
these light resolved .
thats what they deal with dealing with some real situation .
and then you get out here in this world and you got instagram and tiktok showing the flash and presans a life without showing whats happening .
and these kid try to find a shortcut to that to that meal ticker .
and then they will not .
ill talk to many of these gang banger .
now ive talked to some that have been up in the hierarchy of the gang and a few that have gotten out .
and they tell me straight up that when they hear me say the number one need in all people is acceptance that thats what the gang use to turn these kid head .
they do not have father in the home .
they do not feel a sense of belonging .
and thats what the gang sell .
they say hey listen we got your back .
we love you .
you belong here .
and here this big authority figure thats real powerful to them .
and they say hey we love you .
well protect you .
this is a family .
you belong here .
we accept you .
they say i am in .
and thats how they motivate them .
and if somebody will give them an alternative if somebody will say look whats your passion ?
let me help you go after that .
but a kid that doesnt have a dream doesnt have a passion doesnt have hope .
how do you ever expect to motivate that young man ?
youve got to have i say that to adult too .
if you do not have a passion in your life what a horrible existence .
if there nothing you are passionate about in your life can you imagine ?
i would that be to get up every day .
and it be going through the motion gray .
every day the same is the last .
nothing you are excited about .
nothing you are passionate about .
what a terrible way to live .
it is .
and my one of the thing that helped me is see i bring back kid who have graduated from the program to help me with these kid that sleep in the barrack with them .
when i am not with them they go on hey man listen to me .
what this man saying is this is how you get out .
i bring ex gang banger down to talk to the boy .
but i tell you man i had to police in that one time .
i had to police talking to the boy .
they wa they wa they were because they some they they some tough kid .
and i wanted the question to the police officer .
we here to serve and protect .
and a handful of boy kept raising their hand .
why yall keep killing u do not they ?
why yall kill u . and thats a conversation that had to be had .
and all police do not do that .
you have the news this is what we are doing .
this is what we see .
and this is what we saw before .
that wa phone camera and stuff that out there too .
it is a real conversation that we have in dealing with real life man with some real solution to it .
and you coming there to some of them and going to be a big shot in the arm .
i believe that man .
i can not wait to do it .
and i am excited to do it .
i am excited to meet these young men .
i am excited to turn the camera on and let people see the amazing work that you are doing and get people to step up and support it .
thats what we want .
we want people to make it where you can not work with three hundred boy but you can work with three thousand boy .
thats what you want to do .
that you can have the facility and do what it what you want to do to show them that there something else in life besides what they come from .
because some of them come where hope is it is a word .
bro you do not want to highlight .
it wa last year for me .
wanted to guy it came back .
he a minister .
he came back .
and he wa having prayer out in the lodge with about fifty at a boy .
and i do not know what wa going on out there .
and he had him in the circle praying .
and i am looking at the kid .
and i did not recognize him .
but i wouldnt pay any attention because it is many kid come through the camp .
sometimes they drive down .
it is hard .
i wa here four year ago .
i know it is camp time .
and for this dude to be doing that and then helping these cat out man it is such a moving thing .
and the program work man .
and how it is .
hard to ask for money when you rich .
youve tried that .
youve tried to ask for some money in you rich man .
thats a funky conversation .
because first of all everybody when you talk and the whole room is doing this here because they think you got it .
why do not you give it some more ?
nobody want to factor in the effort .
i have one hundred employee .
and i have pay for the ranch .
and i have pay for this food and all this here .
and then i got a company to run .
and i got some employee .
it is waiting on the check .
and they think it is a bottomless pit of money .
it is hard .
and then i am not that i am not that guy either .
it is hard for me to because of my pride level .
because ive been pulling myself up by the bootstrap a long time .
it is that i do not ran up into .
i know three hundred boy that need boot now .
and people either help or they will not .
and if they think it is not the thing to do it is not the thing to do .
but well ask anyway because the boy deserve it .
and you can not do it for everybody .
and then you got to get some help .
and well ask for some help .
i am never thought i could do everything by myself .
you can not do everything by yourself .
but those people that want to help will help .
and those that do not will not .
but i think when they see whats happening here they are going to be part of that .
maybe they give their time maybe they give their money whatever .
but we are going to give them a chance to see whats going on .
thats good work .
the thing i love about this conversation is people love you .
they love your persona .
they love your comedy .
they love the way you deal with people .
and that you always interact with them and never in a mean spirit .
and why even if you are cutting up with them joe can make him fun or whatever .
you are always fast to make sure you are the butt of the joke .
instead of it somebody else ha experienced .
but i love for people to get to see another side of you .
and know what you are all about .
and the depth and caring that you have and how deep steve harvey run .
and i am glad for people to get to see that .
and i am glad to get a chance to pull the curtain back and let them see who you are .
this is my calling man .
i am in the calling part of my life man .
i took me a while to get here .
and now i made good money man .
ive had it .
ive got a great career .
we are going to do some wonderful thing .
but it is all gotten me to this point here .
my purpose is my mama used to tell me something .
when i wa little and i did not get it .
she said son one day god i am going to give you a big house up on the heel .
you can not get up on the heel and do not tell nobody else how to get that .
i aint know what shes talking about back there .
i got it now .
thats what mentoring is all about for you .
i got a house on the heel .
and now i am trying to teach a many people a i can how to get up there .
and this mentoring campus and merit street is another part of it which is going to let me be able to get to a whole lot more people .

we knew that chocolate wa something you enjoyed .
we were motivated to figure it out .
it certainly is a deflaver profile that normally go with your green .
but what we decided to do wa import chocolate flavor from europe .
and we imported a ton and tried them out to see how we could get it to combine .
and we found a way to combine it in a lot of trial and error .
thats john lyon .

the message in our society is wrong .
you are not stuck with the brain you have .
you can make it better and i can prove it .
meet dr. daniel aiman the celebrity psychiatrist the brain health expert and a twelvetime new york time bestselling author .
if i am and i am me braimen being need to love your brain .
mission is to end mental illness by creating a revolution in brain health .
today we discus all thing brain health dementia alzheimers and adhd .
and to bunk the few month along the way .
come on we need to get into the 21st century .
psychiatrist are the only medical doctor who virtually never look at the organ they treat .
think about that .
if you want to keep your brain healthy or rescuer you have to prevent or treat .
the eleven major risk factor that steal your mind .
today episode is brought to you by the awesome organization that make this show possible .
dr. aiman is a pleasure to meet you .
thank you for making your way on a very rainy day here in los angeles to spend time with me .
i am looking forward to discussing all thing brain health optimizing brain health focus memory cognition preventing thing cognitive decline dementia alzheimers .
i am interested in the mutability of the brain and brain health .
and we are going to talk about your new book also .
of course raising mentally strong kid .
i am a parent of four kid .
this is very interesting to me .
but i think the two primary motivating thing that made me most excited about sitting down with you today is first a little over a year ago .
i wa diagnosed with adhd which came a quite a surprise .
many question for you about this .
it wa not something that i thought would be something i would be associated with .
the second is that my mother is currently in the throe of dementia .
obviously a quite devastating situation a all too .
and i want to learn a much a i can about how to help her how to help my dad a you also might imagine is in a very challenging situation .
and of course to do everything i can to avoid a similar peril for myself .
and a much a that might sound i am trying to make this about me i am not .
maybe a little bit with the adhd part but when you consider the statistic on dementia and alzheimers it is about all of u is not it ?
i looked up some statistic about an hour ago .
and it is quite devastating the extent to which these disease of dementia are taking over and growing at alarming rate .
in two thousand and twenty three six.seven million american over sixty five have alzheimers one in nine fifty five million around the globe .
two third of these people are woman which is fascinating .
and it is very much on the rise .
i saw some statistic by two thousand and sixty the cdc predicts a sevenfold increase .
and globally from fifty five million to one hundred and thirty nine million by two thousand and fifty .
this is a problem that is going to leave very few people untouched .
if you are blessed to live eighty five you have a one in two chance .
a beam diagnosed with dementia .
one in two one in two which mean it is either you or your partner .
and thats horrifying .
but what most people do not know is you can have an impact on that .
and it is two thousand and five a road of book with my friend rod chankel called preventing alzheimers .
and i updated it in two thousand and seventeen with memory rescue .
and the big idea is if you want to keep your brain healthy or rescue it you have to prevent or treat the eleven major risk factor that steal your mind .
and you talked about your mom having it .
the namanic that well talk about is called bright mind .
and the g in bright mind is genetics .
but we do not think about it properly .
overweight because my family overweight or i have hypertension because it run in my family or i have diabetes because it run in my family or i have alzheimers disease or i am vulnerable to it and there nothing i can do about it .
and thats a lie .
jean increase your vulnerability .
and they teach you what you should be doing .
for example i have six child three of them are adopted .
we adopted because their parent couldnt stop with drug in alcohol .
and it wa a disaster for these kid .
and i tell my niece if you never drank or do drug you are never going to have a problem .
but if you do it could be serious .
you need to be on an alcohol drug prevention program every day of your life .
i have obesity and heart disease in my family .
i am going to be seventy this year .
i do not have heart disease because i am on an obesity heart disease prevention program every day of my life .
if you have it in your family a soon a you should be serious about preventing these eleven major risk factor .
i want to get into all those strategy .
but let talk a little bit about whats driving this .
what is causing this ?
i would imagine a portion of the spike that we are seeing this increase in incident is related to the fact that people are living long and baby boomer are aging up .
but also i suspect that lifestyle habit are contributing to this a with the increase in type two diabetes obesity hypertension and the .
whats causing cognitive decline ?
are unhealthy lifestyle and undisciplined mind ?
did depression double the risk of alzheimers and woman and quadruple it in man ?
what is the relationship between depression and dementia ?
many people think if you are an older person and you get depressed it is a precursor to dementia .
they are both brain disease or brain problem if you will .
and it is critical in the m in bright mind mental health stuff .
i have excited about this because what i came to realize i started looking at the brain in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one and weve looked it over two hundred and fiftyzero scan .
but early on i came to realize you are not stuck with the brain you have .
you can make it better and i can prove it .
and if i look at your brain and then you have a car accident your brain is going to be worse .
if i look at your brain and then you go on a drug bender your brain is going to be worse .
if i look at your brain and then you all have a sudden you stop sleeping or you go through divorce odds are your brain going to change in a negative way .
but i also did the big nfl study .
when the nfl wa lying they had a problem with traumatic brain injury and football .
eighty of my player got better .
i could see the damage but when they go on a brain healthy program eighty that brain looked better anywhere from two to six month later .
thats exciting .
i wa a consultant on the movie concussion .
and i wa bummed because the movie a downer .
is it the will smith one ?
the will smith one .
remember that ?
and it is wheres the hope ?
and the message on football dementia or cte chronic traumatic and selflawfully the message in our society is wrong .
it is you have this .
it is chronic progressive untreatable .
and player do not come and get help because they feel hopeless .
it is get help early probably while you are still playing .
that you can begin to reverse the damage .
it is the big exciting lesson over the last thirty year in neuroscience neuroplasticity .
you are not stuck with the brain .
you have you can make it better .
there an area of the brain called the hippocampus .
collect seahorse .
it is great for seahors .
it is shaped seahors .
every day you are making seven hundred new stem cell in the hippocampus .
or i think of them a baby seahorse .
your behavior is going to grow them .
or it is going to shrink them .
and if you are vulnerable to dementia thats the area that get hit early in dementia .
and you want to love those seahorse nourish them feed them teach them rather than get them drunk or stoned or shrubble them .
your main protocol in evaluating people brain is this imaging technology called spectre .
can you describe what that is ?
can i tell the prestory to put it in context ?
when i wa eighteen vietnam wa still going on .
and the government had a draft .
and i became an infantry medic where my love of medicine wa born .
but about a year into it i did not being shot at .
it is not for me .
it is for some people .
it is not for me .
i got retrained a an xray technician and developed a passion for medical imaging .
a our professor used to say how do unless you look ?
and then one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine i am a second year medical student .
i get married and two month later my wife tried to kill herself horrified .
and i take her to see a wonderful psychiatrist and i come to realize if he help her it will not help her .
itll help me .
itll help our child our grandchild a they would be shaped by someone who happier and more stable .
forty five year ago i fell in love with psychiatry and ive loved it every day since .
but i fell in love with the only medical specially that never look at the organ it treat .
and i knew it wa wrong and i knew it would change .
i had no idea itd be part of it .
one thousand nine hundred and ninety one i am now a psychiatrist for about a decade .
and i went to a lecture at my local hospital on brain spectrum imaging .
itll photon emission computed to my birthday .
it is a nuclear medicine study that look at blood flow and activity .
it look at how your brain work .
and it show u three thing .
healthy activity to little activity or too much .
how is it doing that ?
what is the process by which thats revealing itself ?
again it is a nuclear medicine study .
what we do is we take a radio pharmaceutical .
we take one we use is called technician .
and technician ha selfesteem problem .
it doesnt being who it is .
and it change shape .
and when it change shape it produce a photon or a little packet of light that we can measure .
we combine technician with hmpa a medicine thats easily taken up by cell in the brain .
combine them and inject them into your arm .
and it is called a firstpass extraction .
seventy of it is taken up in your brain in that first pas or with it about two minute .
and then it is part of the procedure .
a little tiny needle into a vein in your arm .
and inject the medicine .
it light up your brain .
and then we can measure it .
have you lay on a camera table ? ?
it is not claustrophobic .
people lay on the camera .
the camera head come around your head about fifteen minute .
and we get about ten million count or ten million time that little piece of light hit the crystal in the camera .
and then we reconstruct it .
it look a brain .
and we then conceive in your brain which area are most active which area are healthy which area are sleepy compare it to our massive database .
and my eightyearold grandson can look at a scan and go healthy or not .
and it is helpful to look .
and off camera we talked about controversy .
i start looking at the brain .
and we never make a diagnosis from a scan .
thats important .
we make a diagnosis all doctor with all of the information .
take detailed history .
if you came to c youd feel out of about an hour worth .
the paperwork doctor or a story end for a couple of hour .
we get to know you .
and then we would test your brain .
we do a computerized neuropsych assessment .
and we would scan your brain .
and when you put that puzzle together it is powerful .
the first patient i ever scanned .
i went from the lecture on brain spectrum imaging given by the head of the hospital where i worked into sandys room .
she tried to kill herself the night before .
and a i wa talking to her i am thinking she ha adult add .
impulsive suicide attempt after a fight with her husband the she caused .
iq of one hundred and forty four but never finished college when i go .
tell me how you studied .
i wa the one who wa the one i prefer the test .
i put on a pot of coffee .
say up all my duty test .
in my mind i am feeling pretty confident about this .
but when i broach the subject with her shes adult can not have add .
and i am thinking i am the doctor .
she wa resistant .
and i had been doing a study called quantitative eeg up to that point .
i knew i needed to do a twice once it rast .
once while she did a concentration task .
and then after i got the result a couple of day later i am in her hospital room .
she ha a table .
i put the scan on the table .
she had a healthy brain at rast .
and when she tried to concentrate her frontal lobe and her cerebellum which well talk about dropped of it is clear .
what doe that tell you ?
the harder she try the worse it get .
it is classic .
it is what i wa predicting i would see .
because thats what i saw in quantitative eeg .
and when i showed her the scan and explained them to her she start to cry .
and she said you mean this is not my fault .
and it is people who need glass .
they are not dumb and crazier stupid .
people wear glass .
i wear glass to drive .
our eyeball are shape funny .
and we wear glass we can focus .
people have add .
they are frontal lobe and cerebellum often turn off when they should turn on .
medicine or supplement or other strategy well talk about you can focus .
i could see with the image that her shame melted away and her compliance went up .
and she took the medicine .
her relationship were better .
she ended up she wa underemployed a many add people are finished college .
and it wa in touch with her for about ten year .
this wa an inciting incident that allowed you to see the benefit of using this a a diagnostic tool this imaging technology .
i it when my patient get better .
i went into psychiatry and it wa personal for me .
and i loved it .
but i wa already getting criticism from it .
it is we do not do this .
it is not what we do .
but one thousand nine hundred and ninety two all day seminar at the american psychiatric association brand backdimaging in child cytree because i am also a child psychiatrist .
i am excited because i am meeting colleague who do it .
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three i teach with that group .
i am all in on the technology .
but it wa one thousand nine hundred and ninety three lot of pushback from the american psychiatric association .
because it doesnt fit the current diagnostic paradigm .
it is stop giving people the diagnosis of depression .
the person symptom cluster it shouldnt be a diagnosis .
chaspane is a symptom .
it is not a diagnosis .
if you have chaspane it doesnt tell you whats causing that .
and it doesnt tell you what to do for it. . it is in dishatolookdeeper and use other diagnostic tool to confirm whats happening .
but that wa twenty year ago is there a sense that the medical establishment ha changed it tune because if you look at your wikipedia page it is a diatribe on the lack of scientific efficacy with respect to this imaging tuck .
yeah i do not know what to do about wikipedia .
two thousand and sixteen january published eighty study .
people always never publishes work .
it is doderead .
discover magazine listed our research a one of the top one hundred story in science for two thousand and fifteen .
thats pretty excited about that .
two thousand and twenty one the canadian association of nuclear medicine wrote procedure guideline on spact a if i wrote them .
and five of the ten author had been my student at some point .
ftenzero medical and mental health professional referred to our eleven clinic .
and two hundred and fiftyzero scan that you reviewed .
thats a people from one hundred and fifty five .
it is a massive dataset .
what are some of the general trend that ?
what can you extract from that giant dataset that speaks to brain health the mutability of brain health and the type of condition that most consistently in the patient that end up in your clinic ?
can i say with the controversy a little bit longer because it irritates me ?
the people who criticize me say he only due it for money .
you can not see these thing in the scan even though they are not expert .
but let see alternative .
psychiatrist are the only medical doctor who virtually never look at the organ they treat .
think about that .
and obviously if you have a brain dysfunction thats going to dictate a mental health outcome .
if we agree that your brain control everything you do ?
how you think how you feel how you act how you get along with other people .
and when it work you tend to work .
and when it is troubled you are more likely to have trouble in your life .
if you are brain the moment by moment function if you bring creates your mind then why wouldnt you ass the organ that you are working on ?
and a little more history in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three i start to get anxious because i have to big flaw .
and ive worked on them a lot but i people to me .
and you can not change a medical specialty if you are anxious about what people think of you .
i hate conflict .
you and i both .
i hate conflict .
and i people to me .
and all that changed in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five .
i spent from one thousand nine hundred and ninety three to one thousand nine hundred and ninety five anxious because i knew i had to do this ?
there not a choice .
once you look you can not unlock .
and one thousand nine hundred and ninety five i get a call late one night from my sister and ill share it who told me my nineyearold nephew andrew had attacked a little girl on the baseball field .
but no particular reason .
and i am what ?
and she said danny he different .
he mean .
he doesnt smile anymore .
i went into his room today and found two picture .
one of them he wa hanging from a tree .
the other picture he wa shooting other child .
if you think about it he columbine or sandy hawak or parkland florida waiting to happen .
and i am i want to see him tomorrow .
and they lived eight hour from me .
they brought him to me .
and he uncle tanny i am mad all the time .
is anybody teasing you ?
anybody touching you in place that shouldnt be touching you ?
nine hundred and ninety nine child catariss out of a thousand would put him on medicine and therapy .
and because of my experience i already scanned a thousand people at that point .
i am he got a lefthand prolow problem .
and i am i held his hand while he held his teddy bear and got scanned .
he wa missing the function of his lefthand prolow .
ive seen it a hundred time since then .
i learned how to get a cyst the size of a golf ball occupied in the space of his lefthand prolow .
and i told his pediatrician i said you find somebody to take it out because he wasnt in my neighborhood .
and he talked to three neurologist .
all of them said they wouldnt touch the cyst until he had real symptom .
at which point i lost my mind .
and i start screaming at the pediatrician of a homicide or suicidal child who attack people for no reason what do you mean real symptom ?
he got anxious and he said i think they mean seizure or he loses consciousness .
and in my head i am neurologist neurologist neurosurgeon neurosurgeon will do stuff .
i called ucla talked to the head of the pediatric neurosurgery department jorge lazar .
and he said doctor amen when these cyst are symptomatic .
we drain them .
he obviously symptomatic .
and after the surgery i got two call .
and for my sisterinlaw who said the surgery went and when andrew woke up he smiled at her .
she said danny he not smiled for a year .
and then i called from dr. lazar who said my god dr. m. and that cyst wa aggressive that put much pressure on andrew brain that thinned the bone over his left temporal lobe .
his skull had been thinned .
he said if we would have been head and head with the basketball would have killed him instantly either way would have been dead in six month .
thats an amazing story .
whats interesting is the idea that our personality are not static that something in this with the brain could completely change a person outlook on life how they show up in the world the thought that they are entertaining .
and within the case of that example a simple procedure not a simple procedure but a procedure could completely change that .
it can go the other way .
but after andrew and it is now thirty year later twenty nine year later andrew married ha two child ha his own business .
he normal .
and it wa that moment i lost my anxiety and my need for you to me .
thats when the war began to try to change psychiatry to become it is come on we need to get into the 21st century .
and one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine when i told my dad i wanted to be a psychiatrist .
he asked me why i did not want to be a real doctor .
yeah he wasnt happy about it .
why i wanted to be a nut doctor and hang out with nut all day long .
but that he wa reflecting what society belief that your weak if you have a mental health problem you are bad if you have a behavioral problem .
and the image clearly taught me free will is not zero or one hundred .
thats free will is gray .
and i ended up testifying in some duct penalty case .
if i am and i am that mean fortyzero psychiatrist and hundred of thousand only practice doctor obgyn internas that they are practicing witchcraft by making diagnosis based on symptom cluster with no biological data .
last year three hundred and thirty seven million prescription frantic depressant .
thats insane .
whats happening in our society is tragic .
and we need a different way .
in the mission i have in my life is crazy but the mission is to end mental illness .
creating a revolution in brain health which is why i am excited about brain .
it is a bold statement .
it is a great mission .
i think ancillary to what you shared is there a lot of misnomer when it come to mental health language is important in the word that we associate with some of the thing that people experience are perhaps not in the best interest of healing and welfare .
can you talk a little bit about that ?
the idea of talking about disease in general with respect to mental health .
of the three hundred and thirty seven million prescription written for antidepressant virtually no one wa talked to about their diet about their sleep habit about if they turn on the news first thing in the morning .
i love the idea of getting my patient excited about making their brain better rather than you a borderline personality disorder and you are probably not going to get better but here are the thing to do .
or you are bipolar you are going to need to take this medication for the rest of your life .
i am in justin biebers docuseries season and he came to me diagnosed with bipolar disorder on lithium .
i scanned him .
thats not what he had .
but can you imagine being twenty three and people saying you have a mental illness you are always going to have this mental illness .
you need to be on this medicine for the rest of your life .
thats insane .
with no biological data or one of my favorite story a adriana who dearly love normal sixteen year old beautiful go to yosemite .
they think it is a magic moment when they are surrounded by six deer .
ten day later she becomes aggressive .
she start to lose an age shes paranoid shes hospitalized given a diagnosis of schizophrenia .
after three hospitalization multiple medication the family spent one hundredzero .
adrianas a shell .
she come to our clinic shes one of our doctor her brain on fire way of brain on fire .
we see inflammation turned out she had lyme disease on an antibiotic .
within a year shes normal .
she graduated from pepperdine .
shes got a master degree from the university of london .
shes normal .
i think infectious disease and we can talk about covid because it is part of it is a major cause of psychiatric problem .
and nobody know about it because people are not looking at the brain .
and you ask me what are the big lesson ive learned ?
my ultramatic brain injury is a major cause of psychiatric illness .
and nobody know it because they do not look .
one of my friend wa mountain biking and had an accident .
he fell broke his helmet did not lose consciousness .
never had an anxiety disorder panic attack depression .
never in his whole life he in his 50 . all of a sudden he having panic attack .
and for the wrong brain it is a big trouble .
he became suicidal .
he saw me on tv and i came to see him .
he had a dent in the left front side of his brain .
his left frontal lobe is left temporal lobe .
i am gentleman brain injury ?
what i found is youve got to ask people multiple time to ever have a brain .
when i see it on the scan ill generally find it .
it is ever fall out of a tree off of fence diving to a shell who pull car accident cautioned playing sport .
he my god two week before i had my first panic attack i had a mountain biking accident .
and i broke the helmet .
i did not think anything of it because i did not lose consciousness .
consciousness is a brain stem phenomenon .
finius gage the famous case in neurosurgical history wa a railroad construction worker in one thousand eight hundred and forty eight .
and his job wa in explosion .
hed explode out the rock they could lay the railroad track .
and one day there wa an accident that happened .
his three foot tamping iron he wa tamping down the fuse and sand and gunpowder .
and he dropped the rod caused a spark that an explosion .
and it went through a missile underneath his left cheekbone .
he took out the left front side of his brain landed thirty yard away .
and he looked to his friend and said did that ?
and then he looked to another friend .
did that ?
he did not lose consciousness but obviously damage to his brain .
change this personality .
he wa conscientious and a man of good character before that .
and then he got fired because he couldnt stop swiping .
and he did not show up and he had these crazy idea .
and then he wa a stage coach driver and then moved to where all these people move which is california .
every athlete i know is going to tell you that having the gear is key to performance .
if what you are wearing is poorly crafted it is going to put distance between you and those goal youve set .
you owe it to yourself to invest in the best and the best is on .
i am obsessed with the cloud ultra on the trail .
and i got the new next gen cloud stratus three for the road of loving those .
but on also ha this incredible line of lightweight high performance apparel that it is beyond anything ive previously done .
it is this second and none second skin .
i love to rock the sweatwicking ultratea and the ultra short which have this pocket at the base of the spine that perfectly anchor your phone .
i am proud to partner with on .
and i love their vision for the future where their gear is engineered for circularity .
check out their amazing lineup of super comfortable sleek and durable piece for yourself at on.com .
in the case of somebody who suffered a cte some brain injury or in the case of someone justin bieber who being diagnosed with bipolar disorder .
not for nothing .
how about the fact that he young and famous and wealthy ?
how do you not have some dysfunction being young with a young brain trying to navigate that type of world ?
but i guess they almost killed that boy .
he wa pretty out of control for a while and he seems to be great now .
thats all i know .
i do not know him personally .
and if you read his mom book it is public knowledge .
he grew up with a lot of uncertainty and trauma and anxiety .
her parent did not want her to have justin and chanted up going in salvation .
army home from wet motherland .
there a lot .
there some childhood trauma stuff there .
childhood trauma .
and then you think early fame which is one of the worst thing for brain because you wear out your pleasure center .
in the brain all of that excitement and then unlimited money with very poor supervision in a brain that doesnt finish developing until twenty five .
see yeah it is a recipe for disaster dysfunction .
and one of my other patient i dearly love my least i wa god the grammy this year for a song .
make me emotional because the song about love .
and loving yourself .
but wa a shit show for a long time .
shes been on a journey .
shes been on a journey proud of her because shes in charge of her life rather than fame in charge or drug are in charge or other people are in charge .
i work hard with my patient for them to become good ceo of their life .
but you have to take care of the executive center in your life which is your prefrontal cortex largest in human and any other animal by far if you damage it with head trauma drug alcohol bad food not sleeping social medium .
it is not a good prescription .
what are some of the top line most important lifestyle protocol or intervention that you recommend when your patient come through and something lighting up or not lighting up in these scan and realize that there work that can be done to course correct .
it depends on your brain .
there are thing everybody should do .
love your brain and i horrified myself i do not know i guess about ten year ago when i went brain health is three thing .
got to care about it .
nobody care about their brain .
because you can not see it .
you can see the wrinkle in your scanner the fat around your belly and you can do something when you are unhappy with it .
i also think we are not taught to care for it .
it is not something that we think about .
we know we should eat better and all the and we know we can learn thing with our brain .
but there is not a broad sense that we can improve our brain health through certain lifestyle choice that we are making .
immediately your brain worse if you are drinking alcohol or if you are smoking pot .
immediately your brain worse if you do not prioritize sleep if you eat crappy food .
i am going back to these eleven major risk factor but it is three thing .
when i started one thousand nine hundred and ninety one i scanned everybody .
and i scanned my mom .
she wa sixty .
she had a beautiful brain which reflected her life .
she ha seven child fifty four grandchild great grandchild .
she know everybody .
still ninety two .
she know everybodys name .
she know whats going on in their life .
and shes someone that she brings people to her .
i scanned myself a week later .
and it wasnt nearly a good a my sixty year old mother .
and that irritated me .
but i played football in high school .
i had men in gydas twice a young soldier bad for the brain .
but i wasnt sleeping .
i thought i wa special .
i could get by on four hour of sleeping .
i am stupid because sleep is critical .
i am a double board certified psychiatrist .
top in our science student in medical school .
and i do not care about my own brain .
i saw it and i cared .
pymis and b not the cause .
you need to love your brain .
and thats where brain health start .
it is i have this organ .
the creates me .
and then a void thing that hurt it got another list and do thing that help it .
and again you have to know the lesson .
we do the bright mind .
it say what to avoid and what to do .
those eleven principle that are built into that yeah and they are everywhere .
and my head b for example for blood flow .
low blood flow is the number one brain imaging predictor of alzheimers disease .
if you have it in your family and i scan you we are going to look .
spacked is a study that look at blood flow and might a chondrel activity .
forty nine of the tracer take him up in the mitochondrion .
we are going to look at blood flow and energy .
and if it is low we are going to go why head trauma his drug alcohol caffeine nicotine nonsleeping having high blood pressure being overweight .
and we are going to target the reason why it is low .
and then we are going to do exercise increase blood flow .
ginko is one of my favorite supplement because the best plan ever see have taken ginko or regular cayenne pepper beat increase blood flow .
know your risk factor and then know what to do .
and the trick with exercise is coordination exercise .
people who play rocket sport live longer than everybody else .
this is a replicated study unlike ninetyzero people because what coordination doe is it activates your cerebellum little brain ten of the brain volume in the back half the brain neuron .
and if you activate that it turn on the rest of your brain .
i am a huge fan of table tennis and pickleball tennis .
it is bad news for me .
i am very athletic but when it come to anything involving ihand coordination i am terrible at it .
and ive avoided it my whole life .
but thats good news for you .
because there more to be gained ?
yeah get a good ping pong coach .
and do not judge yourself .
go and learn to be good .
and do not have to beat people .
if you spend a half an hour twice a week itll have a major impact on your ability to think .
because you got to get your eye hand and foot all working together .
you think about the spin on the ball .
i think that is a roebig chest .
i have this thing which i think might be fairly common which is this idea that perhaps i am past the point of no return .
i wa a competitive swimmer growing up .
between the age of fourteen and twenty one i wa training four to five hour a day waking up at four oclock thirty in the morning and walking around overtrain a zombie .
i always felt fatigue during that period of time .
alcohol became quite the thing around age eighteen and from eighteen to thirty one a progression into alcoholism .
and during that period of time maybe getting one good night of sleep .
the rest of the night were blackout or recovering from blackout .
i get sober at thirty one but from thirty one to forty i transfer a lot of that addictive energy into my lifestyle choice .
i wa sedentary and subsisting on hot dog french fry pizza mcdonalds jack in the box not exercising .
at around forty i have a come to jesus moment .
i changed my lifestyle habit and many thing about my life and i am a much healthier person now .
i am a playbased diet .
i am very fit and active .
i am engaged mentally through the process of doing this podcast and other thing that i do .
and my life is good but i can not shake this sense that i have done much damage over the course of my lifetime .
that no matter how many good thing i do now that at some point i am not going to be able to overcome that damage .
it is going to catch up to me .
and whats the point in doubling down and investing in all of the thing that you are saying ?
and i think on some level that might be common people are thinking ive treated myself terribly .
that song ha been sung .
it is a lot .
mutability is your whole thing .
we can not but is there a period at which i would suspect it is more difficult than it is for others .
but what would you tell someone myself or someone who of a similar mindset or a similar type past history ?
one we should look ?
and many people go no i do not want to know .
yeah i am scared .
if you a little scared if you knew a train wa going to hit you wouldnt you at least try to get out of the way a long a there wa a possibility to get out of the way ?
of course .
if i couldnt get out of the way let it hit me and i am not the wiser .
i want you to be on it .
scan my brain on youtube and instagram .
and one of my favorite guy troy glaus two thousand and two world series mvp played third base for the angel .
love him daryl drinking way too much for concussion to press suicidal .
he wa in a dark place did not think there wa any hope .
and i got him to do my show .
i do not know how bad happened .
but he did what i asked him to do .
and his wife anne who i dearly love she wa a good partner .
he stopped drinking ate better exercised took the supplement lost fifteen pound in two month .
and i am let look again because i could tell he wa better .
it is brain significantly better .
in a two month period .
two month .
and then i scanned him sixteen month late .
how old is he ?
forty seven ?
now and there were ups and down ?
when you are an alcoholic doe you do not stop ?
some people do but there wa some bump for u . but we are in the fight together .
and sixteen month later his brain is good .
and i know five year from now if he continues on and he ha brain envy .
his brain going to be freaking normal .
you have a choice .
but if you do not know if you do not look you do not know .
and why would you ever be in that position ?
i want to know which is why every couple of year ill get a whole body scan because if trouble coming i want to get it early .
i do not want to wait until late .
many of the lifestyle illness that we are seeing now are track to chronic inflammation .
what are some of the thing that we can do to ameliorate that that have implication in term of brain health ?
in bright mind the first diet is inflammation .
and some surprising thing is ninety eight of u have low level of omegathree fatty acid .
if you are not taking an omegathree supplement or focused on eating lowmirkory high omegathree fish thats a problem because lowmagatree increase inflammation .
if you are not a bit obsessed with your gum and your teeth youve more likely to have brain disease and heart disease .
and i did not tell you down on that a little bit it is always amazing to me that that doesnt get enough bandwidth in term of our overall health .
because i now have had parodontal disease and gum problem my whole life .
and i wa educated early about the implication of not treating that because that tends to lead to arthrochlorotic issue and brain health obviously it is a circulatory situation .
it ha to have implication in term of brain health .
because your brain is two of your body weight but us twenty of the blood flow in your body .
twenty of the oxygen in your body go to your brain .
and if you have gum disease infection in your gum parodontal issue abscess and the how doe that translate into circulatory issue ?
what do you have a higher risk of alzheimers disease ?
it increase inflammation which many people think is the mother of all illness .
i do not know about that but i do not want to have inflammation .
and for a long time i did not care about my own gum until study after study gum disease heart disease gum disease brain disease .
no got ta take care of them .
become a flossing fool .
in term of blood work what should people be paying attention to ?
you mentioned omega 3 but if someone doing a blood panel and they get the result what are some thing that would jump out to you ?
if we look at some of the important number for bright mind blood pressure would be for blood flow retirement and aging you do not want high iron level .
iron accelerates aging .
do you do not want low iron because ill make you not sleep and be anxious .
and i tend to accumulate iron i go donate blood twice a year and that seems to help .
good for other people good for me .
for inflammation you want to know your c reactive protein for genetics .
you probably should know your apoe for gene type .
i am a two three .
is that the gene thats connected to that increase the crisshampsworth situation ?
he a double or a lealer whatever ?
yeah yeah he a e44 which mean he ha a ten fold risk .
but a ten fold risk mean about twenty five .
and it mean be serious and exercise the exercise you are doing decrease the risk if you have one or two e4 gene .
for head trauma system number of head trauma you have toxin hows your liver function ?
liver function test mental health that your ace score adverse childhood experience .
how many do you have ?
my wife wrote a book called the rolentons courage of scared child .
shes an eight .
not of ten .
my niece is who i adopted her both nine .
if you have four or more it increase your risk of seven of the top ten leading cause of death .
if you have six or more you die twenty year now .
my niece is in my wife are not dying twenty year early because there are thing you can do to extract the past trauma which is super important .
the second eye is immunity and infection .
know you are vitamin d level and get it above forty people who are above forty have half the risk of cancer of those who are under twenty .
when i first tested mine when i figured this out twenty year ago i wa seventeen .
because i exercise but i exercise at night because i am working during the day and i realize i need more sun and i need to supplement to have a healthy level not too much but a healthy level .
and then and is neuroharmones get them tested every year .
we are living in a society where low testosterone level are rampant in young male and ive never seen anything quite it .
what is contributing to that ?
head trauma and toxin .
are more young male having head trauma than they used to be ?
with football and soccer and skateboarding maybe the other thing is toxin on their body .
the product you put on their body .
i have all my patient download the up thing dirty and scan all of your personal product to see the healthy g thing it .
it is similar to it .
for example it is to shave with barbersaw fifty year and on a scale of zero a lowlong ten is kill you early .
it is a nine and now i shape with something called kiss my face which is a two .
it is insane the extent to which there are many chemical in our everyday product that were unaware of and the lack of regulation on this .
ive had plenty of guest in the past come on to talk about i can cut from uwg .
my friend darren oleen wrote a book called fatal convenience and you read it .
it is very solution oriented but it is quite an eyeopener to realize the amount of toxicity in our personal care product and thing that we take for granted and assume our safe .
and what happened during covid ?
it is all of a sudden these toxic hand sanitizers that have parabens and dalades and fragrance that are bad for you .
people are lathering themselves they are child with this stuff which is why i am a fan of earth friendly product because they make these claiming product that i know interest in them except i love them .
i am now being sick is expensive .
this is about love .
why would you put something on your body or your child body that is pleasing ?
get your hormone checked and then your hemoglobin a1c obviously and your bmi .
they are very important number to know seventy two of american are overweight forty two are obese .
it is the biggest brain drain in the history of the world .
then i did an nfl study healthy weight nfl player versus overweight nfl player love frontal lobe function and i am no and can you talk about it without somebody being mad at you ive had lot of people mad at me but it is science ?
i am making the connection if you are overweight of these eleven risk factor you have seven of them because it decrease blood flow promotes aging increase inflammation change healthy testosterone into unhealthy cancer promoting form of estrogen and you got ta get serious .
now being underweights bad for your brain being overweight bad for your brain .
if you do not love yourself it is pretty hard to invest in get that person to invest in healthier lifestyle habit .
there is a mental health thing a much a it is a rational logical information thing .
and there are many people who had or childhood trauma for example who developed real rage about what happened but then guilt about the rage because i still have to be with these people .
they still house me and feed me .
and it go unconscious .
they started attacking themselves .
it is hard for me if i believe it my core i am bad to do the thing out of love because you do not love yourself .
and that is a brain problem because trauma get stuck in your brain but it is also psychological problem .
i think of all my patient and four big circle .
it is the biology which is brain health .
why we got to look at your brain and those important number we talked about .
how is your psychological health ?
it is your mind whats the quality of your thought the level of the trauma you have whats the chatter in your head .
there also a social circle .
whats going on in your life now with your kid with your spouse with work .
and there a spiritual circle .
what is your deepest sense of meaning and purpose ?
and in my mind when i evaluate my patient all four circle all the time i want to have an exercise called the one page miracle .
relationship work money physical emotional spiritual .
what do you want ?
you can look at it on a regular basis .
are you noticing what you about the other people in your life more than what you do not ?
and whenever you feel sad mad nervous or out of control down with your thinking .
and i have this great process thinking in honest accurate way .
i am not a huge fan of positive thinking .
i am a fan of accurate thinking with a positive spin .
thatd be worth chatting about .
and i am going to get your brain healthy .
if i give you these strategy and you do not do it i want to bond with you you come back and trust me .
and then i want to work on perhaps the past trauma .
i love a therapy called bmdr specific psychological treatment for trauma stand for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing .
and i love another one called istdp intensive short term dynamic therapy .
and the foundation of that therapy is people struggling .
they will not do the thing that could do to be healthy .
it is attachment problem that led to rage and then guilt about the rage and selfattack .
it is they are living that i did something wrong .
even though everybodys done thing wrong .
and most people forgive themselves .
they are living with this selfattack .
and that take sometimes intense therapy but doesnt have to be long .
thats why they call it intensive short term dynamic psychotherapy .
and youve had success with that great success with that ?
yeah it is interesting .
because you can show that person is not a many scan a you want but until you want to tie that knot and get to the root of whats driving that disposition thats preventing them from making change it is not going to matter .
ive never seen anything a powerful a showing somebody there brain with addiction .
when i first started ordering scan a the director of a dualdiagnosis unit psychiatric hospital unit that take care of substance abuser their brain were bad .
and i wa here healthy brain here your brain .
your brain control everything you do which brain do you want ?
i think anybody with an addiction should get their brain scanned .
and i came up with a wrote a book with david smith called unchained your brain breaking the addiction that steal your life .
and giving everybody prosaxons saying there are many different way to get depressed .
give everybody a twelvestep program .
it is a bit insane because they are impulse of addict they are compulsive addict they are impulse of compulsive addict or sad addict or head trauma addict .
it is no the type you had .
and if somebody diagnosed you with add which we will talk about thats our impulsive addict group .
it is you want to do the thing but you do not have enough of a break to stop .
and that could go with low frontalow activity .
our compulsive addict they get the same thought in their head over and over again .
and sometimes clinically it is hard to tell the difference because they go i am impulsive but what they mean is their compulsive .
they get a thought the impulsive person get a thought and doe it without thinking .
the compulsive person get thought over and over again and ha to do it .
and one is a dopamine intervention .
the other is a serotonin intervention and how would unless you looked ?
hey everybody .
today episode is brought to you by seed .
good health .
i talk about it all the time on the podcast .
it is important if youve even listened to a few of my podcasts .
i think ive maybe devoted i do not know it doesnt .
two dozen episode to the micro biome .
you got to take care of your gut health if you want to have optimal health .
your nutrition your lifestyle habit sleep all of these thing play into that but it is also important to find a good free biotic and probiotic .
there a lot of nonsense out there .
you got to follow this science and the best evidencebased product that i found out there is seed dso1 daily symbiotic .
ive been taking it for i do not know over three year at this point every single day there a tremendous amount of science behind this product .
i urge you to check it out .
and now it is a great time to do that because you can get twenty five off your first month of seed dso1 daily symbiotic .
hit the link in the description below to visit c.com slash rich roll and use code rich roll twenty five .
a little over a year ago i did a week long intensive therapeutic process that wa intended to be traumaoriented childhood traumaoriented and it wa incredible .
and over the course of that week i spent time with a wide variety of psychiatrist .
and at the end of that week there wa a consensus among all of these psychiatrist that i had adhd .
a i said at the beginning that wa news to me because i had always thought of this a a condition associated with hyperactivity .
i wa not a hyperactive kid .
i did not feel i had any of the symptomology that at least in my mind wa associated with that condition .
but through the process of being diagnosed and working through it ive developed a whole new perspective on this .
and i realized the extent to which i developed coping strategy to deal with this that allowed me to overcome that predisposition .
i would have never known .
i did not think that i wa that person .
swim and ill treat it .
yeah thats how i did it .
i would exhaust myself through exercise and that i could calm down and sit .
i did not have that experience of not being able to focus because the exercise gave me a different baseline .
can i talk about the five homework symptom of add and you tell me which one you have ?
they are more the diagnostic criterion includes eighteen but i think of one thats short attention span but not for everything .
it is short attention span for regular routine every day .
thing school or homework paperwork chore for thing that are new novel highly stimulating or frightening people with add compared attention by because they have their own intrinsic dopamine .
love is a drug especially new love is a dopamine drug .
if you love your teacher we are going to want to please them .
and you do fine in that class .
but your attention span is erratic and thats what fool people because they are no but i am interested .
i heard president george w. bush say this and he said now i did in the class i wa interested in and i am not another add president we came off of bill clinton who clearly had impulse control issue .
doe that resonate with you ?
the thing that i am interested in i can be completely obsessed by .
and i have a huge capacity for persevering and determination .
and i could force myself to do the work that i wasnt interested in but it becomes very exhausting .
and i thought everybody wa suffering through this in the same way that i wa rather than the truth which wa i wa this round peg trying to jam myself into a square hole .
yeah that you did not love it .
and if you have add one of the thing i tell my add patient is find something you love that you can make money up. . too often find thing you love that you then depend on other people .
thats prescription for misery .
the second symptom is distraintability .
too much .
you feel too much you sense too much .
it is the world come at you quickly .
and you want to sit down and read a book but then you get distracted by the email or by your phone or because you are hungry or something .
but also is not that everybody ?
no my best friend in medical school had add .
and i loved him dearly graduated top of our class .
i wa second .
he wa first but he wa my partner .
i wa proud of him .
and distracted .
and it wa funny to watch him .
i do not feel i am a distracted person but i do feel i need to be doing one thing at a time .
and a long a i have this one thing that i am doing i am i can focus .
i can even when i do not feel doing it i can overcome that overwrite it and do it .
where i get into trouble is when i wake up and now my life is very full there lot of thing happening .
and i start to think about all the thing that i have to do .
and it becomes very overwhelming very quickly .
and i get stressed and anxious and that get translated into being an aggravated person and being unpleasant to be around .
but it left to my own device .
if i can i to go all in on one thing disappear complete it and then i am open for the next thing .
the third one is organization .
it is hard for people who have add organization for time and space .
now i think there seven different type of add .
whats the difference between add adhd ?
what are we talking about ?
i think there seven type .
thats what i learned from imaging .
but add attention deficit disorder wa a name given to this thing .
it used to be called minimal brain dysfunction before them .
by the american psychiatric association with dsmthree diagnosecens statistical manual one thousand nine hundred and eighty .
thats what i trained on .
one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven for god know what reason .
they changed the name to adhd .
it used to be add with hyperactivity or add without hyperactivity .
and they changed the name to adhd to lump everybody together .
the problem is have the people who have this disorder are never hyperactive .
and it wa very confusing .
and then one thousand nine hundred and ninety four they changed the name again to ad slash hd .
highlighting have the people have this or never hyperactive .
the name are not scientific .
let be super clear about this .
there no biology to this .
a group of psychiatrist get together and they vote based on what they think the best evidence is an often it is silly .
we lost aspirer time .
everybody now whether you are elon musk and high functioning autistic get the same diagnosis a someone who in a developmental center that can never live independently .
when i first started imaging i am it is not one thing based on imaging .
and if we look at your brain ill be able to tell you .
type one is classic adhd short attention span distractability disorganized for time and space .
we did not talk much about that one but your room your desk your book bag trouble with organization .
and you might not that guy .
you might be type three .
well get to that .
people with add tend to be late or on time because they do not start getting ready to go until my god i am late .
thats not me either. . i am generally timely .
this is why i want to go and get a break .
not convinced .
one two not that much the not being able to multitask is very male brain thing a opposed to an add thing .
disorganization forest procrastination you put thing off put thing on put thing off .
i do that until you are mad where somebody else is mad at you .
and then five is impulse control .
or do thing probably shouldnt do .
and it is the break in your brain is vulnerable .
and i think those are the five thing .
and if you have three out of five you probably do have it .
and it sound for you somebody should look at your brain. . and what would you say ?
wa it the interrupting at the conference you went to or at the treatment you went to we are all the psychiatrist you have .
the interrupting what do you mean ?
were you interrupting people and conversation ?
or no i do not think .
why were they saying that ?
am i interrupting you now ?
is that what you are saying that ?
i get a key to that on the podcast interrupting people too much .
if i wa interrupting they did not tell me that i wa .
and if i wa doing it i wa probably not consciously aware of doing it .
why did they want to drug you ?
what did they see ?
that they went you have adhd .
probably related to addiction issue perhaps ?
or coping mechanism that ive developed to focus or the way in which i can use excessive exercise to calm myself down .
and it is how do we know unless we look. . it is when i think .
what would in a brain scan of a brain with adhd versus a healthy brain ?
often healthy at rask and drop with concentration especially in your prefrontal cortex from the third of your brain .
an area called the basil ganglion where dopamine work and your cerebellum .
healthy at rask drop when you concentrate we need to fix that .
and you can fix it with exercise .
you can fix it with certain stimulating supplement and sometimes medication can be incredibly helpful .
but the problem is what i saw because i am a child psychiatrist and an adult psychiatrist .
but what i have to the patient we have at amen clinic have add of one form or another .
and what i found there classic short attention span destructability hyperactivity impulse control issue .
there inattentive add never hyperactive or terribly impulsive but trouble performing trouble with focus .
i have a child with both of those type .
type three is overfocus problem is not that you can not pay attention .
it is you can not shift your attention .
you end up to get stuck on thing .
and because you are organized that tends to be the one exception is type three .
but these people also tend to be argumentative .
our positional of thing do not go their way .
they get upset and they can hold on to grudge .
and their addiction of choice tends to be thing that calm their brain down whether it is alcohol or marijuana .
type four is limbic add .
there are emotional brain work too hard and they tend to see the world through dark glass .
they have a hallmark add trait plus mild depression .
type five is temporal lobe add .
often from a head injury .
one or both of their temporal lobe hurt .
mood instability irritability temper stuff six famous for .
it is made it to movie .
it is called the ring of fire where the brain is not low in activity .
it is high in activity .
it is working way too hard often due to inflammation and type seven is anxious add .
and it is their level of anxiety that get some place on time but they have to work much harder than their colleague .
and all of these are rooted in genetics .
some is rooted in trauma but add is very genetic .
it is genetic that if i see an adhd child and i do not see it at all in their mom side or their dad side i am looking at the kid to see if he look their parent .
it is that genetic .
yeah i do not know if i could identify it in my family tree .
i am not qualified to .
but it can also be caused .
by a concussion .
and if you come to see me one of thing we are going to ask you five or six seven ten time .
have you ever had a brain injury ?
have you ever fallen out of a tree off of fan ?
do not win to a shallow pool .
have you ever had a concussion playing sport or car accident ?
i look forward to getting my brain scanned .
itll be super interesting .
we can do this .
let talk about raising mentally strong kid .
you handed me this book .
perhaps you can give u the thesis .
why did you write this book ?
and what is it that you are trying to say here ?
child are at the worst in recorded history a far a mental health problem .
the level of anxiety depression adhd selfharming behavior is out of control .
brand new study .
fifty four of teenage girl report being persistently sad .
thirty two have thought of killing themselves .
twenty four have planned to kill themselves .
and thirteen have tried to kill themselves .
school are overwhelmed by the incident of kid on medication and the kid suffering with panic attack and other mental health problem .
it is awful whats happening .
and what i learned early in my career is the most effective intervention to raise mentally healthy kid is parenting strategy .
and the first one obviously if you want mentally healthy child you have to be mentally strong yourself .
i talk about how important that is .
and then there this system that ive become attached to that i think is effective .
and i wrote the book with my friend dr. charles faye who is the president of the love and logic institute .
and that program is very important to me personally because when we brought that into our home it became much happier .
and in the book we mixed neuroscience and the program ive been using for year with love and logic .
we combine these two program to do what we think of a the latest innovation in parenting .
every parent want mentally strong kid .
we want our kid to be confident kind responsible all of these thing .
and obviously kid into it how you are behaving .
thats much more important than whats coming out of your mouth .
if your if your behavior is not matched what you are saying they are paying attention to the behavior much more than the word .
but we are where are even the best intention going wrong ?
the statistic that you you quoted are devastating .
there a lot of thing contributing to that of course .
but where is it where we think we are doing the thing and perhaps we are misguided .
we are rescuing child way too much .
we are solving their problem because of our low self esteem .
and i am guilty of this .
i think for the first three and i love all my child .
and if you do not feel great about yourself you get self esteem by doing for your child when they could cure themselves .
and then what you do is you create incompetent people .
when a child come to you and say on board to often parent then scramble to get them the latest video game or take them someplace rather than give them the problem back .
i wonder what you are going to do about that .
and then be loving enough to not fix them .
my wife and chloe are twenty old when she wa seven theyd have these monster homework battle .
and i am a child skytrust and i look at hannah and go youve done second grade get out of this fight .
but three of her friend recommended parenting with love and logic .
and thats the foundational principle .
let kid solve their own problem .
be a good coach be a resource do not solve it .
and when tana understood it she announced a chloe sweet heart ive done second grade .
i am never ever again going to ask you to do your homework .
it is on you .
and if you do not do it youll have to be with the consequence .
and chloe had fit and said i never said it wa going to do my homework .
i am not going to do it now stormed off came back twenty minute later .
shes now a junior a chapman no one ever asked her to do her homework again .
and she had a four.two out of high school .
shes responsible .
she competent and consoled her own problem .
we go wrong when we steal their self esteem by solving their problem .
for example chloe knew it if she forgot her homework nobody bringing it to her .
if she forgot her sweater on a cold day nobody bringing it to her .
if she forgot her lunch it take twenty four hour to starve .
nobody bringing it to her .
and she only forgot those thing and now shes forgetting anything .
yeah you become self directed .
you developed that self efficacy that will serve you later in life .
self esteem come from performing esteemable act on behalf of yourself .
and if you are always rushing in to solve the problem or rescue you are depriving your child of the opportunity to learn those things. . it is a shortterm gain longterm pain situation. . a lot of time crunched .
parent are let me solve the problem because i ive other thing to do .
and i can fix this rather than allow the child to scramble and mess up and figure it out on their own because sometimes thats not convenient. . and it is also not gold directed .
principle number one is now what you want ?
what parent do you want to be ?
and what child do you want to raise ?
ask yourself that question ask the other parent that question .
parent do we want to be ?
and what child do we want to raise ?
because then your behavior stem from whatever mission statement you create .
and then the second thing is attachment .
and that requires two thing .
time actual physical time .
and listening parent talk way too much .
and we have all this great knowledge and all these great experience .
we want to pour it into their little head and they tune u out .
if you do active listening with them theyll be close to you .
but if you tell them how to think and you interrupt them it is very bad for the relationship for the attachment .
and then i have an exercise in the book thats gold .
it is worked every time .
i think parent who do it the way ask is twenty minute a day with a kid .
do something with them .
they want to do .
and during that time no command no question no direction .
and when i first figured it out and then i saw it work and it worked in a work .
my literary agent at the time carl he called me up and he said i am having trouble with my twoyearold .
he had a child later in life .
and laura wa too and shes she never want anything to do with me .
what do you mean ?
i am do this .
and i told him a special time twenty minute a day do something with her that she want to do which mean sit on the floor and play with her block .
and he that will not work .
he tended to be oppositional .
i said you need to do this .
i am going to call you in three week .
get the party started .
and three week later i called him up .
and i am hey carl it is daniel .
daniel she will not leave me alone .
all she want to do is be with me .
i sit or walk in the door .
she grab my leg .
she want her time. . because it is not that what we all wanted .
unless our parent wa awful we all wanted their attention .
and i am one of seven .
my mother after ive been to your dish about how she did .
but because my dad wa never home we did not have a relationship .
and one thousand nine hundred and seventy two turned eighteen .
he told me if i voted for my governor and the country would go to hell .
and because we did not have a relationship i voted for my governor .
and the country went to hell but it had nothing to do with my governor .
it wa because of nixon and watergate .
and i having influence with my kid but there no influence without connection .
there different kind of attachment .
also i think thats very wise .
and it is also very straightforward and doable invest your time in your child .
be interested in what they are interested in .
when they tell you something do not lecture them or tell them why they are wrong say tell me more .
and be on their level where they do not feel judged or you are going to explain something to them ?
i think thats great advice .
on the opposite end of the spectrum from someone your father is the very enmeshed parent .
thats a different attachment disorder where they are overly invested in their child being and the child becomes a vehicle for their own selfesteem .
they are projecting all of this emotional baggage on their child .
and the child then is shouldering this responsibility to make their parent feel .
and whether that projection is ambition or their own insecurity or their own dream that were never realized the child on an unconscious level is is subsuming all of that .
and that becomes problematic .
i to think of good parent good coach .
and ive been blessed to work with some amazing coach .
and good coach notice what you do and they teach .
bad coach notice what you do wrong and focus on it .
and in the book there a whole section on why i collect penguin .
i have two thousand penguin .
it is a little weird .
not reallyzed penguin .
penguin pen cup doll tie i have a penguin weather rain a penguin vacuum bizarre .
but my oldest child anton who i adopted he wa hard for me .
he wa a manative oppositional .
and i talked to my supervisor .
and she said you need more one on one time with him .
and i took him to a place called sea life park which is in hawaii .
it is on a wahoo .
it is sea world .
they had sea animal show and we had a great day .
whale show sea lion show dolphin show .
and at the end of the day i took him to the fat freddy show .
he wa a humbled penguin chubby .
but he amazing .
he climbed a twenty foot diving board went to the end would bounce and jump in the water bold with his nose countered with his flipper jumped through a papaya .
and at the end of the show the trainer asked him to go get something .
and he brought it back .
and time stood still for me because in my head i am damn i asked my kid to get something .
and he want to have a discussion for twenty minute .
and then he doesnt want to do it .
and i knew my son wa smarter than the penguin .
and i realized i wa the problem .
and i went up to the trainer afterwards .
and i am howd you get freddy to do all these cool thing ?
and she said unlike parent whenever freddy doe anything what i want him to do i notice him .
i give him a hug and i give him a fish .
and the light went on in my head that when my son did thing i liked i wasnt paying attention .
but when he did not i gave him a lot of attention because i did not want to raise bad kid .
and i collect penguin a a way to remind myself every day i am shaping the people around me by what i pay attention .
it is this this totem to bring you back to that place .
thats cool .
you mentioned the peril that many teenage girl are experiencing currently when a young person reach a certain age it is natural for them to differentiate .
and sometimes if not often the communication suffers with the parent a a result because the kid is no longer interested in hanging out with the parent a much they got their own thing .
they want to shut the door to their bedroom and do their thing and not be bothered .
there many thing we talk about in the book attachment protects and you need to supervise your kid until their brain develops .
you need to understand normal development your prefrontal cortex the front third of your brain largest in human and any other animal by far is not fully myelinated until you are about twenty five .
and we think of eighteenyearolds a adult it is ridiculous from a neuroscience standpoint and the insurance industry knew this way before a neuroscientist knew it .
when do your insurance rate change ?
when you are twenty five they go down significantly because you may better decision because you have more myelinated frontal lobe .
and myelization is important .
when you are born there not much of it going on in your brain .
about two month the back of your brain becomes myelinated and better which is why when you smile at a newborn they do not smile back .
but when they are about eight week old you smile at them .
they begin to connect with you .
myelization think of a copper wire or a neuron a brain cell .
myelization is it get wrapped with shewilded fatty substance insulation on a copper wire and that neuron work ten to one hundred time faster .
and your prefrontal cortex the most human thoughtful part of you is not fully myelinated until you are about twenty five .
and it is undergoing wild development from fourteen to twenty five yet thats when many parent advocate their role .
and send kid off even though they are not mature enough to go hang out with a bunch of other unmyelinated brain the joint sorority and fraternity and all sort of bad thing happen to kid then .
i think we need to have supervision in a way not thats intrusive but it is i am watching .
i want to know where you are .
i want to know when you are coming home .
and kid hate it .
but what ?
they hate it more if you do not do it because that mean you do not care .
whats the council for the parent who struggling to bridge that communication gap with the teenager who leaving me alone i do not want to talk to you or how wa your day fine the naval gazing that occurs around that age ?
yeah i think try to be in their space much a you can and be a good listener .
there always two word to default to firm and kind .
if you understand the research we talk about this in raising mentally strong kid .
it is parent who are firm and loving do way better than parent who are loving and permissive .
permessiveness raise the most unhealthy child whether you are loving and permissive or hostile and permissive permessiveness is not good .
it is good to have boundary and rule and kid should have chore .
and the problem is i would love for people to write down this statement i only do nice thing for people who treat me with respect .
and to often child will be very disrespectful and the parent will go out of their way to give them thing because of their own guilt .
i do nice thing for people who treat me with respect .
and i am always nudging to have that time .
and even if they reject you i keep coming back but do not bend over and do all these nice thing for people who are rude to you .
thats not good .
what is your counsel around device ?
clearly some portion probably a large portion of the depression the suicidal ideation etc .
thats on the rise particularly with teenage girl is a result of on some level social medium that comparison that take place the twenty fourseven access to what your peer group is doing at all time .
the bullying and criticism that occurs there parent i think are often confounded and confused about how to manage that .
the self absorption what social medium lead to is a toxic level of it about me .
and my counsel delay is long a you can .
i would hold out a long a you could and then supervise it .
and if you are paying for it it is you can have this make sure they are parental security thing on it because having eightyearold boy exposed to pedographies a very bad thing for the developing brain .
talk about wearing out your pleasure owner .
you need parental device delay it and then if they have it it is you only can keep this if i have access to it .
i think it is important to have supervision .
you have to be their frontal lobe until there is develop because there dangerous thing out on the web .
you get it a long a it is not a problem .
those kid who play video game theyll have a fit when you tell them to stop the video game need to go away .
need to go away because you are the parent thats your role .
ive sent way too many child to video game addiction program .
i do not that .
and they are but a friend are doing it it is you can do it a long a it is not creating a problem .
and i think you should limit it because the device and social medium and video game they dump dopamine .
they were purposefully created to add to you .
they use the same principle that la vega us to win money in gambling which is intermittent reinforcement .
i am not going to reinforce you all the time .
we are going to do it every often and it dump dopamine .
what doe that mean ?
you have two pleasure center in your brain .
they are called the nucleus of cumbans part of the basal ganglion .
and when you get excited about something that produce a little bit of dopamine push on the pleasure center .
but the more you push on it the harder you push on it think about these violent video game .
pretty soon nucleus of cumbans becomes numb and you need more and more to get the same effect .
you start with an addiction toward the end of the addiction .
you were not getting the out of fact that you did in the beginning ?
because your pleasure center had been worn out .
we are wearing them out earlier than ever before .
and i think thats one of the big reason we are the escalating incident of depression .
the social medium site are similarly designed .
similarly designed .
there are scientifically devised to addict in the same way that a slot machine or a video game is designed and mind share .
thats what happens .
that becomes tricky when you have a sixteen year old or an eighteen year old .
and part of being a member of their cohort or their tribe is being conversant on these platform and being in communication on these device .
it is not a easy a saying i am taking your phone away because thats the same a saying you are being kicked out of your community .
yeah but you have to be careful .
you have to be willing to do that in order to show love which is super visioned .
if a parent is seeing their child sink into a depressive state what is the advice that you would give ?
the first thing is do not put them on an antidepressant .
thats not the first thing to do .
now maybe the seventh or eighth thing to do .
but the first thing is to evaluate their lifestyle .
to often child are taking their device to bed and they are not sleeping .
and i think it is a good family habit for everybody including the parent but their device away .
or for you to take your kid i had one patient recently the got a new phone had an ipad and wa up till to a clock three oclock four oclock .
and he wasnt doing in school .
it is yeah sleep to write people do not do in school .
supervising technology i think is critical .
i teach a high school course called brand thrive by twenty five .
weve done it for fifteen year .
it is been on seven different country all fifty state .
we teach kid to love and care for their brand .
and what i found is the going idea about teenager is parent have lost influence and their friend are more important and they will not listen is wrong .
if you are bonded to them they listen .
you have to explain it to them and give them reason why these company use neuroscientist to addict your brain and steal your mind .
these vaping company they are making money off of your early death .
you have to educate them and get them angry .
when i call the evil ruler if i wa an evil ruler and i wanted to create mental illness what would i do ?
i create vaping device and go this is a healthy form of smoking or id make them think marijuana is innocuous clearly it is not .
or id give them a device thats clearly addictive and ha all sort of side effect and go have fun with this and other people your age are doing it it is probably .
when you educate them my twentyyearold she know the time a day that shes on her social medium site and she limit it and now shes doing this thing is how much sleep can i get ? ?
and she find i do better with nine and a half hour and i do it eight hour .
ill say wow smart is that that shes tracking it she us device or ring to track it and it is because she understands it .
rather than do this do not do that but thats not how poor it is relationship and then this is your brain .
how can you take care of your brain and thats what we do with brain thrive by twenty five ?
from the historic campus of hillsdale college in hillsdale michigan where the good the true and the beautiful our top nurtured and honored this is the radiofree hillsdale hour bringing the activity and education of the college to listener across the country .
i knew that if i insisted on putting the language in and agreement with them that i would be caught a foul of mrs. reagan which wa not a very pleasant situation .
this is your host scott bertram .
welcome to the radiofree hillsdale hour part of the hillsdale college podcast network that wa ken kachigian author of behind closed or in the room with reagan and nixon .
and for this election week we spend time later on in today program with a band who ha spent lot of time behind closed door with both ronald reagan and richard nixon .
first we are joined by dr. kathleen otool a system provost for ktwelve education at hillsdale college .
dr. otool thanks much for joining u . thank you for having me .
i am discussing today in appedgey road a while ago in the detroit news .
classical charter school can help reverse covidlearning loss and can be found at detroitnews.com .
start with the basic i guess .
are we what is the data ?
are we still catching up from this learning loss that wa suffered during the covid pandemic and then the subsequent school shutdown ?
some people might take a look and say they are a little behind .
what are the possible ramification ?
why should we care that student are behind where they should be and if they continue to lag behind where they should be in their education ?
the data we have is regarding reading and math score and i can talk about the effect of a of a poor reading and math education over the course of a student k through twelve year .
but first i think the point need to be made about the habit that are developed .
anyone who ha young child i have two very young child now they are two and three know that the name of the game is building habit .
and if you do not build the habit chaos will rain .
thats the phase that i am in now .
and then of course understanding the difference between learning time and play time .
and those two thing in hillsdale affiliated school are not mixed both are very important .
but learning time is one thing play time is another thing .
and they are both important but need to be separate .
that whole way of going about your life a a five or six year old is new .
and you are entering school for the first time and learning this ability to get yourself into learning mode that you will need to have for the rest of your childhood and into adulthood .
if these habit are not formed they will not naturally happen .
they have to be formed eventually .
and there a a there a golden opportunity to form those habit when child are young becomes more difficult a they get older .
let look at reading and math .
there is two different thing happening when it come to those subject and a child early learning about math first .
learning mathematics is building a skyscraper .
it begin with everyone know the beginning of the mathematics skyscraper .
you learn addition first and then you learn subtraction and learn multiplication and division .
why is it that way ?
is it because weve always done it that way ?
no it is because thats the logical order in which those four essential mathematical concept have to be taught .
you can not understand multiplication unless you understand addition first .
it can not be done .
same thing with division and subtraction .
it is got to proceed in that order .
the rest of math education is that way too .
thats the beauty of mathematics .
it is pure and clean .
and the order in which it need to be taught is logical and we can know it .
and if we follow it it will work .
other subject are it is a little bit le clear although the same principle apply .
these student who who lost math instruction in the early in the early year of the pandemic and who were not given an opportunity to go back and build the foundation of their math skyscraper are at risk .
because the rest of the math skyscraper is being built .
and if there are hole in the early stage of the foundation itll be shaky and itll eventually topple .
the math skyscraper tends to topple when student encounter a more advanced mathematical concept .
the first most difficult one or the first difficult concept you encounter is fraction .
and that come about third or fourth grade .
and if you do not have division which mean having multiplication subtraction addition fully under your belt you will not be able to get fraction .
and itll happen again with algebra .
and these student these student will start to show their the gap in their foundation .
if we do not go back and fill them in properly .
reading is a similar story .
the acquisition of reading skill is a process that go on throughout a child k through twelve education begin with decoding english word .
and there a period kindergarten through third grade where we talk about a child learning to read .
and then in about third grade a child ha enough reading ability that they can start reading to learn .
in other word you can give them a text and they have enough ability to decode enough vocabulary enough content knowledge to read that text and get other knowledge from it other than how to decode english .
if a child learning to read foundation is not built properly a it already wasnt being built properly in a lot of american education .
but it definitely wa not being built properly when child were not going to school .
then their ability to read to learn will be damaged .
and reading is in a sense the most important thing you learn in school because without the ability to read you reach a point in your life where you can not learn anything new .
from a teacher perspective can you talk perhaps a little about that challenge then of having to expedite the learning process or to help those child catch up in the classroom to make up for those loss ?
yeah thats hard .
and we run into this all the time because we work with brand new school .
and they do not start with kindergarten .
they start with kindergarten through sixth grade or sometimes more than that .
my own school started kindergarten through tenth grade .
and we were welcoming student into the first grade of first year of school who were in seventh and eighth grade .
theyd never studied any formal grammar .
theyd never studied singapore math which is the logical way that we go about it .
theyd never had phonics when they were in elementary school .
and they had all of these gap in their foundation .
the good news is child are made to learn .
that is what childhood is is learning .
they are not u . they are open to learning and they are nimble and they are able to absorb new information quickly .
and it is not a difficult a you might think .
the challenge is knowing how to fill the gap .
and we would do thing at the beginning of the year by have a two week intensive on english grammar for new student .
and theyd spend a couple of hour of day reviewing the thing that the rest of the classmate had done before .
and they were able .
they were able with a few month of concerted work and support by the teacher and their family to catch up .
any child can do that thing .
if teacher are given the opportunity to slow down and fill in those gap .
and it may seem wed be losing time by doing that .
but the shaky foundation will continue to be shaky .
you must not go forward .
you have to fill it in .
dr. kathleen otoole is with u . she is assistant provost for k12 education at hillsdale college .
hillsdale k12 ha a network of these classical charter school across the country .
what doe the available data now tell u about the effectiveness of those classical charter school to help in this fight ?
the data that we have about the classical school the effect of the covid shutdown on classical school show that the classical school had le decline in student achievement .
and i think thats for a very simple reason .
classical school have a plan for student education kindergarten through 12th grade .
and they were able when student were no longer attending school or whether they were attending school remotely to identify exactly what instruction wa being lost .
and then when they had the opportunity to be back with the kid they knew exactly what the plan should be in order to get everyone back on track .
on top of that looking at hillsdale school and thinking back to that time we were very eager to get back in the classroom wa student in person a quickly a wa legal and safe .
and in that time when it wa not possible to be with student we kept the principle of inperson instruction the life for a much a possible .
and zoom instruction wa synchronous .
and we tried a hard a we could to replicate the energy and the engagement that in an inperson class .
i remember visiting some of our school in colorado and i watched a teacher .
this student it wa a time when some of the student had come back to school in person but parent had the ability to keep some of them at home if they preferred .
and i watched a teacher with a classroom of maybe eighteen student and then she had six or eight on zoom .
and she wa teaching the zoom student in the inperson student simultaneously .
but she wouldnt have wanted to do it any other way because she knew the power of being there with her student .
a question we should answer i think which occurs when we talk about these classical charter school is that might be good for some student but is it for everyone ?
is it classical education the one offered at hillsdale college classical charter school ?
is it fit for everyone ?
or is it for only a particular type of student ?
it is for everyone .
classical education is an orderly course of study that is rounded and it happens in classroom with teacher who are excellent at explaining .
there is no child that will not benefit from that .
the course of study is good for everyone to know .
regardless of where you come from regardless of where you are going .
and because the instruction is vivid engaging you learn more in a classical school than you do in a le personal le energetic environment .
i think classical school because of their origin in private education have a reputation sometimes of being elite only for tuition paying family or something but thats an accident .
thats not inherent to classical education .

we are joined now by ken kachigian .
he is the author of the new book behind closed dors in the room with reagan and nixon .
also director a narrative of the richard nixon foundation board of director veteran of nine presidential campaign in chief speechwriter and senior political advisor for president ronald reagan .
ken thanks much for joining u . good great to be here .
thanks for having me on .
always wonderful to hear the story from someone who wa there .
and a they say in the room we are all thing happened .
i want to begin by asking you about your experience overall .
the american people and our listener have some idea of the culture or the white house that we have picked up from other book that we have picked up from popgits or culture tv show .
is the portrayal that perhaps most of u have and the perception true to what you experienced in the nixon reagan administration ?
television and movie are dramatization .
they to get people excited and tv show the west wing and movie frost nixon and others are hyped up .
generally it is getting you get folk over a state of view what it is in the white house .
movie all the president men .
and usually they bear homey a flyresum with serality .
but all movie are portrayal and dramatization .
if you want to get into the meat you need to talk to people whove been there me .
and i want to say and my book is a which is why i am glad you have me on .
because in a lot of the book about biography and memoir a lot of the memoir most of the memoir about reagan year frankly have been ghost print and in a lot of my colleague and do not have time .
then not sugar and larry speaks and mike d. we are in jim baker chief staff and all of them had ghost writer write their book .
and they do not get the real feel for it .
to get real honest and revealing a count of what it is to be there in the room a ive written the book you have to have someone who give an honest account .
and i took very detailed note of everything i did what president nixon and president reagan .
what i convey is almost transcription now .
it is not the white house tape but it is pretty close .
and i try to do portrayal of the personality and character .
and i try to do it in an honest way a best i can .
and what you get in the movie and tv show are not i wouldnt take i wouldnt take those to the bank .
can you work for president nixon work for president reagan both with deep root in the state of california which now is new a a leftist haven .
but then wa wa radically in the presidential election and had haven of conservatism .
do you think that the culture of california helped to form both of their approach to politics in washington ?
but i think california wa not we did not have forty odd million people back in one thousand nine hundred and forty six when dick nixon wa elected to the congress .
and when ronald reagan got elected to the governorship the culture of california wa wa wholly different .
in fact i did not work for those two president .
i helped who wa the lead strategist for governor george duke maynard when he won the governorship in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two and i helped dan lunger and the getlife attorney general in one thousand nine hundred and ninety and i worked with beat wilson .
the concept of radical taxation began with jerry brown frankly who did not have much of a sense of controlling government .
he wa off there in some sorry id land and lost control of winning me and got into a second term when he returned to the governorship .
thing changed pretty dramatically beginning in the 90 and in the turn of the century .
in governor schwarzenegger wa always a republican wa not in the same republican mold a richard nixon in rome reagan .
that culture shift changed largely also because i would have to say the union start taking over the school and had a huge impact on the education of our child and the university .
they give a very balanced view of their course but now i think thats different .
i think thats whats happened to california over the last few year .
we will not get into everything of course inside behind closed door the do book for the country again .
there a wonderful part at the beginning where you take u through the prep for the frost nixon interview .
i am a larger watergate scale though i know you lament that nixon did not end up having the support of a house and set up republican .
they did not stand up for him during the ofgate scandal and postwater gate to get scandal .
why did not he find that support ?
what happened ?
i think there wa overall fatigue that it is an interesting question you asked .
and i think looking back people forget that nixon came into office bearing an enormous burden that wa left with a snarling at his doorstep that wa vietnam war left to him by the kennedy johnson administration .
five hundred and fortyzero men in vietnam with five hundred of them being killed every month with another thousand casualty .
and he wa trying to draw down that war .
and the protest which began under johnson spilled over into nixon administration with the massive protest all across the country beginning after nixon took office .
the republican in congress were in the position of having to defend what then turned into nixon war although it wasnt nixon war .
it wa kennedy and johnson war but they had to defend nixon war policy a he wa trying to bring the war down .
and he had to continue the defense of that what wa going on in vietnam war because he wa trying to balance off china against the soviet union because there were thermonuclear war power .
and he wa trying to offset what wa happening on a muchgrinder scale .
what wa what took place wa he wa calling on his colleague republican colleague in congress for their support for monetary support and for financial support in a congress that wa dominated by democrat .
and by then by the time watergate hit in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two and then through up to seventy four after two year of fighting watergate the republican in congress were tired .
they were tired of defending the vietnam policy .
they were tired of defending the medium attack on watergate that were all and the partisan attack from their colleague in congress .
they shot up by thirty five percent .
now nixon wa faced with the recession .
and american were angry across the board .
republican in congress in the senate house were faced with having to defend an administration that wa burning the burden of the end of the vietnam war which ended with the peace talk at the beginning of one thousand nine hundred and seventy three with the burden of watergate .
and now you have a recession in one thousand nine hundred and seventy three .
and with the midterm election coming up and a couple month away from august of one thousand nine hundred and seventy four they it is not the bravery doesnt take place when theyll win you are on the ballot quite often .
they were tired of fighting .
ken kitchigin with u is new book behind closed door in the room with reagan and nixon .
chief speech writer senior political adviser for president reagan you have the watergate scandal with nixon you have iran consra with ronald reagan .
how would you compare or contrast the approach in dealing with those topic in those various administration ?
watergate wa dragged out for for two year and it wa pillar between the toh room wa that both president had very little knowledge of a lot of the true fact going into obviously richard nixon .
and your listener are aware .
and a lot of people think that he instituted the breaking which wa thats crazy .
he had known all of the watergate breaking .
he did not authorize it yet .
and i think the do of that .
and he wa getting bad information about who wa in charge .
he wa getting denial from the leadership of the that his campaign committee about who instituted it .
he instantly went to his backup plan which wa political damage control .
in reagan case pretty much the same .
he did not have the full fact instantly with regard to iran consra .
he did not he authorized the weapon transfer that got him in trouble .
it wa rather confusing situation .
i think he thought he wa doing the thing .
but then he wasnt getting all the but i think proper information .
and i think what he thought he had done wa the thing for his his foreign policy but he did not realize that he wa getting in meshed in something that wa deeper than it wa .
and in both case thing got out of control more than they wanted to .
i think people need to understand that president are not dealing with the the scandal when they are in the presidency .
theyve got a lot of thing they are dealing with .
they are dealing with national defense they are dealing with the daily activity of the presidency .
they are dealing with daily intelligence report that they are getting they are getting intelligence brief every morning from their national security council .
they are dealing with their massive amount of information coming from their congressional liaison .
the presidency doesnt deal with the scandal that come inside their door the cell there bombarded every day with other event .
you do not sit there .
in a lot of how i am going to resolve the scandal thats dealing in my front door .
and a lot of time the easiest route is to not be held daily with whatever the scandal is and put it on the back burner .
and thats what happened .
i think both with flaregant and ron concentral until it to both of them got out of control .
ken there lot in behind closed door about ronald regans wife nancy reagan .
and the relationship she had both with the president and the relationship he had with you and other staffer .
you run the gamut from early in the administration .
you describe her a being a chief of staff .
ronald regans tough guy when it wa needed .
and then you take it all the way through this i guess wed say conflict .
you had with her around the one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven state of the union of dress .
the president wanted to include some language about protecting the unborn .
nancy behind him shaking her head .
how would you describe nancy reagan role in the president administration ?
how important wa she in shaping the message that eventually went to the american public ?
she wa a there wa no enclosure to the president and mrs. reagan .
he relied on her much for advice on everything .
if there wa good cop bad cop she had to be bad cop she wa bad cop .
and if he wanted to convey a message that he wa uncomfortable and conveying sometimes he would have mrs. rady can convey it .
and she wa helpful in the campaign of eighty for example i described wheres the chief of staff because she helped bring order to the campaign .
if there wa to me she wa very helpful in teaching me what wa the best way for him to communicate sometimes .
and then later in the eighty four campaign when the president wa getting bad advice from his chief of staff and his deputy chief of staff on how to communicate in the campaign .
mrs. reagan got them all straightened out .
and she wa my ally in that respect .
but she disagreed with the president on this particular policy of abortion .
and the scene i described wa where the president in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven stated union address wa refinalizing the speech .
said to me i do not have the exact word in front of me but it wa word to the effect can .
we do not have a message here for our friend about protecting protecting an aborn .
and usually i have those in my speech .
and mrs. reagan wa standing behind him and gesturing to me shaking her head to no no no .
and i wa caught in the middle .
it wa a very very uncomfortable situation .
on the one hand he wanted the language in the speech .
on the other hand she wa vigorously aggressively shaking her head to keep the language out of the speech .
and i think she wa being influenced .
i do not know where she wa being influenced perhaps by her family perhaps because she thought that that language wa not politically correct .
i do not know what her motive wa .
but i knew that if i insisted on putting the language in and agreement with them that i would be caught a foul of mrs. reagan which wa not a very pleasant situation .
ive concocted a situation where i convince the president where youve always your friend know where your heart lie and youve included all your other speech .
and i think this may be this one time if you only let out you can be forgiven .
and it wa i do not know it wa i felt i wa betraying him in a way but then on the other hand maybe i wa saving myself from getting my head cut off .
i it wa talk about being between sola and corruptus that wa one of those situation .
ken cachigian with u who book behind closed door in the room with reagan and nixon you advised nine presidential campaign and in particular of course nixon and reagan .
and every president is different .
every candidate is different .
every campaign is different .
there one central theme that work in every campaign that richard nixon that advised president reagan in one thousand nine hundred and eighty .
and thats one of the theme of the book by the way that people did not know about that nixon advised reagan secretly in eighty and eighty four .
people will find out in the book thats very important and that nixon put into memo to reagan .
and that is that the economy is a very central issue on people mind .
and that go back if you think about it that go back to the 20th century go back to the day of pover and fdr and truman and kennedy and the year of all those other campaign people think about the economy .
when you think about what happens in people life when they wake up in the morning wrote a bed at night they think about feeding their family paying their rent paying their mortgage how to get buyer every day .
and another central point is someone that someone ha the depth to wear the mantle of the leader of the free world .
and i think thats an issue .
can kachigian is the director emeritus of the richard dixon foundation board of director veteran of nine presidential campaign chief speechwriter and senior political advisor for ronald reagan and the author of the new book behind closed door in the room with reagan and nixon .
can thanks much for joining u today on the radio for a great day of hour .
great to be here .

welcome back to the radio free hillsdale hour .
fight u on x we are at hillsdale radio .
we now hear excerpt from a recent lecture by clay travis cohost of the clay and buckshow and founder of out kick .
his lecture titled wokeness in sport wa delivered in april of two thousand and twenty four at a hillsdale college event in bellevue washington .
clay travis begin by telling u about how he entered the world of sport journalism and why sport is important .
i came into the world of sport a a lawyer with the idea that sport wasnt escape from the serious thing in life .
a toy chest is the way it is described of life that sport if you read the newspaper and i still to read old school newspaper .
i am sure some of you do is one of the only section if not the only section that regularly celebrates achievement not failure .
the least read sport because it is the ultimate meritocracy .
the best man or woman win not the best man pretending to be a woman .
and what they have done what i saw it and look i got into it a a diehard southeast and conference football fan .
i love college football .
it is one of my passion .
i got into it because i wanted to escape the serious thing in life and the thing that i loved about sport .
ive my first book .
i wrote wa dixie land delight about going around to all twelve sec football stadium .
thats a fan .
what i loved about it wa it brought everybody together .
white black asian hispanic male female if you have ever been in a crowd .
your team win a game .
a you are highfiving everybody around you and that stadium or that arena you do not think about their race you do not think about their gender you do not think about their political belief .
that is a uniquely connective moment .
that janitor and that neurosurgeon would be on equal playing field when it came to their opinion .
ive made this analogy for a while .
we have created identity politics and tried to transmit it to the world of sport .
think about how often you hear somebody say now .
their identity a a prelude to the opinion they are about to share .
why in the world should i care what you look ?
i care about the quality of your opinion .
how did that happen ?
how did the left manage to take over sport ?
travis continues explaining why we need to have thing in common and how sport help give u that common bond .
what are we seeing ?
i talked to our commentary wa interesting to me we were talking during the meal .
he said everybody ha to take the same course .
you have to have a common language .
i took my family to italy .
i work way too much but last spring break we went to italy .
we toured all over the place my kid were another cathedral .
if youve got young kid they were another one dad .
but i wa blown away by it because i love the idea of someone being committed to their craft that they tried to make one thing infinitely more beautiful than what otherwise be that will outlast their life .
and while i wa there i thought to myself what ha been built in my life that anybody would travel to go see hundred of year from now .
i wa born in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine .
i can not think of a single edifice that is incredible and that people are committed to that it will still matter in four hundred year .
and the need for how did they do that turn out western civilization is a profoundly good thing .
and what i do not hear enough people pointing out and i think sport is a big part of this is your ability to rip american institution is a luxury of western civilization that ha provided you the opportunity to platform and the freedom with which to do that .
we are listening to excerpt from a hillsdale college lecture by clay travis goose to the clay in buccio and founder of outkick thats from april of two thousand and twenty four on wokeness in sport travis explains here how politics began to infiltrate sport .
now the truth matter and this is where we all come in and why i am optimistic and how it change .
whats wild to me is i think ninety of sport fan understand that men should compete against men and woman should compete against woman .
i do not think thats a remotely controversial option .
yet the only sport medium company in the world or at least in the united state that will say that is outkick .
the market though can win and this is where hillsdale come in and this is where being a voice for truth in a world that is filled with artificiality come in .
the great thing about sport is unlike argument .
two different side of an argument can happen and you can both leave and you can think you are both one .
what i love about sport is it eliminates the uncertainty .
we can all argue about who the best man or woman is or who the best team is .
game happens and then we all agree .
i have never seen the team that lost an tournament show up and try to take the court after they did not have the most point on a scoreboard .
everybody agrees with what happens in that contest .
over time the truth win because ultimately the market doe decide and i look around now and i say to myself we are the lone voice in the wilderness on this issue .
but everywhere i go i see more and more people coming up to be in saying thank you for saying what you said .
riley gain who i talked about earlier .
shes twenty for three year old .
she wa set to go be at dentist .
if she hadnt happened to swim against a man pretending to be a woman and she said this is wrong and changed her entire career trajectory to justify against that .
it is bravery .
it is courage .
and finally clay trappis concludes by talking about woman being taken advantage of in athletics and how we almost stand up to help truth prevail .
i do not think that this is for the most part .
i think it is wrong .
but i think it is going to have to be woman talking to other woman and standing up for the reality of what it is to be a woman to keep men from being able to take over woman space .
we talk a lot about male privilege white privilege all these thing .
i got to be honest with you .
i can not think of a higher level of privilege than i am a dude .
i am going to pretend to be a woman .
you all have to claim that i am a woman and acknowledge it and i am going to become a woman champion .
thats whats going on now .
thats what wa reinforced an echo ten day ago .
where we are is not representative of where america is .
and that is why all of you but particularly woman have to rise up and speak out and make your voice heard .
because what i believe is the rational common sense american public sport fan is not being served by the marketplace and not being spoken to honestly .
thats what we strive to do every single day at outkick which is why the number one thing i hear every day is you say what i wish i could say .
and i do believe that the truth will rise again .
and i think and believe that outkick is going to be a huge part of that but we have to take back sport and we have to take back honesty and truth .
and only then can sport return where i do believe it should be a a place of unity rather than division in the modern american culture .
that wa clay trappis cohost of the clay and buckshow his lecture wokeness in sport .

it is been a couple year .
i remember meeting you and thinking to myself at that moment .
ive got almost twenty year of experience and this guy make me look a rookie .
i am super excited to talk with you today and glean a little bit of what youve learned in the industry .
if memory serf me i guess we are getting close to forty five year .
is that sound ?
yeah i wa in the industry .
i wa working at an institution for thirty seven year and now ive been still connected through our dayo and through consulting .
yeah it is been close to forty five year now .
eight year retired .

forty five year .
thats a long time .
i get this .
thats great .
with that you did did a little bit of it .
can you tell u a little bit about your background roger where where you started .
tell u what you are what you are working on and what you what youve done in the past if you do not mind .
yeah yeah i i said thirty seven year on on campus thirty of those were in enrollment management .
i served at four different institution .
the longest service wa the last place where i served at trinity international university in chicago land area .
i started at leternal university my alma mater all probably talk a little bit more about that a a we go but .
but i retired from trinity in two thousand and fourteen eight year ago .
i retired early .
i at least i felt it wa early .
and i had an eye toward doing some consulting .
i wa interested in doing leadership development executive coaching and that thing .
i got some certification and some training and wa excited to extend my career away away from higher ed and and do some of that but a it turned out .
there a big need or wasnt he still is a need for enrollment consulting and that dominated my opportunity that i had after .
after that early retirement i did quite a bit of enrollment consulting .
i added part time role with our day a we got to be .
collings and good friend a a result of that and .
and i added that in two thousand and seventeen three year after i have retired from from trinity .
and and now every tire twice because a jonathan they threw a retirement party for me at our day and i am now .
i am now retired but not i am still doing a few thing with our day out .
and and then other than enjoying the country living in little tennessee and spending a much time a i can with my great kid .
i think about it a having four professional or still in the water or .
iron still in the fire however you want to put it one of those is still working in a reduced role but still working some part time for our day out still doing a little bit of enrollment consulting .
i usually limited to to at the most client at at a given time .
and i am reduced that the amount of work i am doing in in consulting .
and all of these thing i greatly enjoy and thats why i keep on doing and plus plus it keep me in the in higher education space .
i am also doing a mentoring a leadership development program for that cap you mentioned that we had met at an at cap conference i am still involved with them .
and and what i do with them is .
his help a a mentor in a leadership development program for young enrollment professional enjoying that and then i serve on the board of my alma mater the turn of university .
i get to see thing from the other side of the table at board meeting which is interesting and enjoyable and fulfilling for me but still got some more in the in the water and doing some thing to keep me connected to higher ed .
i will say we will keep you here at our day a long a you a long a you want to i think .
speaker everybody up and down we we love having you on the team but i will also say that if thats what retirement look i am not sure i want to retire .
you do have a lot of iron in the fire thats for sure .
only because i enjoy .
yeah there you go there you go .
you mentioned the turn of and how you still serve on the board there today .
thank you at least from a higher ed perspective thats probably a good place to start probably where your higher ed journey started if you will .
the amount of walking u through your your personal educational journey .
and then how that went what you already talked about the fact you attend a return of .
but how did you find yourself there walk u through that story .
yeah thats thats an interesting story .
i wa born and raised in pennsylvania and for those that do not know what turn is in long be texas along way from pennsylvania back in the seventy early 70 when i graduated from high school .
it probably wasnt that normal to go that far away from home at least not for country boy me from from middle from central pennsylvania .
but my my dad had met the founder of the internal university our g maternal who is a relatively famous industrialist who had over four hundred patent in his career .
and did a lot of speaking and my dad bumped into him and heard and speaking with very intrigued by his life story .
and then found out that he had founded this i wa a fledgling school at the time it did not start till one thousand nine hundred and forty six it wa opened in one thousand nine hundred and ninety at the tail end of world war ii .
but but anyhow .
he got me interested in it and and while i wa .
not a i did not know that much about our general internal or about industrialist or about invention or anything that and it felt an adventure to go from pennsylvania to texas to go to school .
i think maybe ill take him up on that if he willing to help me attend look turtle university back then it wa maternal college .
and mostly known for engineering and aviation and technical program and that is not what i ended up in obviously but but but i absolutely never regretted that decision it wa one of the best decision i ever made wa to go to the maternal .
and i went on from there to give my master degree at the university of wyoming one of my mentor at the maternal .
wa a wyoming grad had his got his phd at wyoming and he wa in the habit of .
i wa with my wrestling coach and and wa .
and i wa one of his athlete and he he wa in the habit of recommending at his athlete and student .
for fellowship or assistantships at the university of wyoming master program in physical education .
thats what got me to the university of wyoming i did a little bit of doctoral work at the university of arkansas .
thats my educational journey .
and then you all if memory serf me correctly you went back to a turnover after that it might write on that .
yes my first job out of a graduate school wa to go back and coach .
i wa on the faculty for physical education and i did that for seven year and and then .
i to tell you how i got into enrollment management you might be interested in that and listen to my .
and that but .
yeah at the end of that seven year i asked for a leave of absence of maternal .
to to work on a doctor will be free and i wa granted that and a i said earlier i chose the university of arkansas education program and i wa at a crossroad .
i keep coaching that wa still a possibility and i wa very impressed with the baseball program at arkansas in the coach there and i thought maybe id get a chance to be mentored by a guy .
norm debrine and any i wa one reason i went to arkansas .
i wa also toying with the idea of an academic career in in exercise science and .
and that wa part of my study at the master level and and interestingly when i got had my exit interview with the academic dean of the internal thick berry he .
and i made the comment he said we we will guarantee you a job when we give a leave of absence will guarantee you that will hire you back which can not guarantee you itll be in the position that you are in .
and we are going to have to fill that position when you are gone and we can not we do not know what what will be open but one thing weve noticed about you and one reason we are willing to give you the .
i leave of absence a you seem to have some administrative skill and would you be interested in an administrative role of anything were open and i said sure that wa a third option that .
that i that i added to my possibility .
it wa a two year leave of absence after a year we had a young family after a year i got a call from what you are not offered me a position of .
associate dean of admission and record wa the wa the title and and having a young family and struggling a little bit financially i thought maybe i could finish the back .
it never made a big difference in my career but but i did thats how i got into enrollment management because admission and record .
while it included mostly record work in the beginning register with any year i wa named the chief .
admission officer within a few month i wa named the chief admission .
i think i think they thought here you watch he wa a coach he a recruiter therefore he can run an admission office .
thats not necessarily the case .
it is not the thing that when you are either ten year old you are aspiring for being an enrollment management .
you are always looking to be a baseball player .
thats what i wanted to be .
i wasnt my lap and i ive had a great career .
thats thats an awesome story .
i think of all the thing that ive known about you and the history .
i do not think i ever knew how how you started in in admission thats a thats a great story .
the the last thing here here you got here you go roger this and though we can we can help you in the family and better but it is admissions. . ill play .
a little bit of a side note there the way i got it is because you are nobody grows up wanting to to go in admission .
in sixth grade i do not know if ever told you the story but in sixth grade .
i had a we were learning economics and everybody would bring in thing to sell at school and we had faith money to learn economic .
and i i brought in chilly willys towards the end of summer little i thought .
and i wa selling those thing crazy but the guy next to me a friend of mine named jordan his father wa the dean of admission at kataba college and he gave jordan all these pin and no pad .
in little sweetie and all this stuff and and it is a sixth grade or you are enamored with college and he wa selling those thing left and and i thought thats thats what i want to do .
i am going to be able to give out pin and no pad and .
little i know it and it and it and it and tell a little bit more than that .
my goodness thats great talking about the education .
excess experience and how they influenced your trajectory obviously when you started there at maternal and started in that position and quickly move to the the chief admission officer enrollment officer .
you obviously found a niche you you stay there you stuck there for the the rest of your career .
wa there any deviation out of that roger in term of the enrollment side or did you stay all in enrollment .
yeah it is interesting to you ask that i wa in and i wa in enrollment reported to me the rest of the thirty year thirty plus year and our thirty thirty year and i wa in higher ed back .
but there wa one little detour while it included enrollment management it wa broader than that .
i went from maternal to king university i wa king college back then i saw two institution change from college to university which wa .
and interesting and wa a part of both of those .
and but after about six year at king i wa asked by a colleague of mine to serve on a team of consultant to look at a situation that an institution that wa in crisis it wa bluefield college in virginia .
and they were going through some tough time and the board decided to bring in a team of consultant anyhow short short story is at the end of that consulting .
experience the board called me back and said they want to talk a little bit more about my part of the report and and they offered me a job .
and they said we are big trouble they had lost their entire senior leadership team except for the academic dean and he wa going to retire in a year .
and they were in some pretty serious financial trouble those that are from the bluefield area will remember that .
i took them up on it i took a job a the chief operating officer to help them put all the piece back together at bluefield and enrollment reported to me but it wa one of many thing that did and i learned .
and that wa that wa one of the greatest learning experience i ever had .
but within a year they had put thing back we had put thing back together we had some some financing in place we pretty much rebuilt the president cabinet .
and they were about to hire a president and king offered for me to come back at that point and i went back and served three more year at king .
but but yeah that wa the only detour that that while it included enrollment and that wa a very important part of what wa going on there .
luckily the director of admission wa still there but all their cabinet level people including the entire financial aid officer lost all at one time .
i wa quite an experience i could i could spend an hour talking about that experience but .
but that wa a little bit of a detour and i learned a lot and and i think it helped shape my my the rest of my career .
but yeah one year one year that wasnt directly a vp or in charge of enrollment .
yeah and those thirty plus year that that youve been in the enrollment industry roger what what have you seen a one of the biggest challenge i think in my career the set to me love it .
overcoming student wanting to be closer to home and that that wa certainly a bigger challenge a we look at discount rate thats been a bigger child what a youve seen .
let be honest enrollment management the term enrollment management did not exist then it wa more the admission .
whats been one of the biggest change you youve seen or youve faced and in your career .
yeah it is an interesting question that .
in roman man move a brand new concept when i got into it in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four it developed in the 1970s and there were some .
flagship university that were using the team the term already i think it started at the university of indiana but not the stake and that wa the first institution to use the term .
i remember people making prediction about how and roman management a a career wa going to be something that .
i never would have dreamed of and most of the people that worked in enrollment management that i knew at early in my career would have never .
i think that that that it would have the change that it did and a lot of those prediction in fact i would say most of them came true .
all the different fluctuation and birth rate and and graduation .
all of that stuff would way off in the future yet back when i first started and and i ended up living all of that in my career moving into those position and holding senior level position which in the beginning that wasnt .
the norm for somebody that wa working in admission .
the but but i would say the biggest seed change that i saw happened .
in the way that enrollment management needed the function and the way that family made their decision happened during the two thousand and eight recession .
it wasnt a huge recession but if you remember it put a spotlight on on student debt and it put a spotlight on the cost of higher education .
because of student debt it is one of the thing that made me think that our rap wa one of the best idea since life spread and when i heard about that i said thats exactly .
the way we ought to be tackling this is you because much of the information thats out there in the medium is .
hiked up it is not the way thing are and people fear student debt much more than they ought to .
but that had a profound effect on me at trinity and it had a profound effect on a lot of especially small private college .
and it wa a big issue that i think thats the biggest challenge in the biggest seed change that i saw that you are two thousand and eleven made a difference .
there were some other thing that happened but thats the one that stuck with me a a a big change .
and you did not know in the head i vividly remember that and how that became part of the national rhetoric of whats discussed and is the cost of college out of control .
and thats obviously something that we are passionate about but it is it that part hasnt gone away it seems every election cycle it it .
you talked about the birth rate that thats something that it seems in two thousand and twenty five we are we are going to be getting back there with this demographic apocalypse if you will .
a a you think back to your .
your career early on a a young professional and you think to these young professional it always seems .
the industry the career is constantly young thing the old regime if you will .
it is changed out every often what what would what advice would you give to younger professional now is a. hey here a yield time thats coming up this may be something that in your career that you may want to look look at or maybe .
proceed with caution type type situation .
yeah i think about that question a lot simply because of the mentoring and the coaching that ive done in the last several year and i am always thinking about they are going to be .
ask the me question but what do i want to volunteer to them based on my own experience in career i think about that what do i wish i had been exposed to .
or told or .
recommended to me when i wa when i wa starting out and and use the first what the pop into my mind and i think it took me a lot to learn this .
i think thats the reason why i am going to be a person of of the enrollment result a year institution is and and the way i put it is .
is when you are enrollment is up better than what everybody expected do not take all the credit .
because you are going to be tempted to you are going to be tempted to accept all of those accolade that that the president and the board and faculty and everybody are going to want to say all you are doing such a great job be careful about .
about doing that because there are many other factor that affected that success rather than you and even you and your team and there a lot a and there many factor that it is .
and now the converse that is when it is down .
a whole lot le than what everybody expected do not take all the blame resistant and and yet early in my career i think i did both .
i i wa puffing my chest out when thinking we are looking good and then i am thinking the world is falling apart .
i am the one to blame if the enrollment is down .
and while there might be piece of that that we need to accept the responsibility and even some of the credit when thing are up it is one small piece and thats the message that i think enrollment leader young enrollment leader need to discipline themselves .
to present that message they yeah thank you i appreciate that let go have lunch let have a pizza party whatever we want to do but let keep in mind here that this is not .
this is not solely because of u in how we recruited i think we did a great job do not get me wrong but there a whole lot of factor and then have that list of thing that you think went .
a opposed to simply absorbing all the credit and the same thing with the blame .
and i wa interested to see what it would say and it felt somebody got inside of me and looked at me and do all my secret about what would go through my mind and how i wa wired a person .
and i thought how valuable that is and for me to be able to communicate that to the people that i work next to or that work that work that report to me or that i report to .
i became such a valuable thing to me i wish i had known that earlier .
i think that could have helped me through some real rough spot early in my career and then i think i learned some about some blind spot that i had and i wish i had known them earlier .
blind spot that .
i do not have a blind spot about about seeking result .
i do not have a blind spot about process .
i know how what to do and how what the step are to get there .
some people have blind spot on those thing .
my blind spot is on how thing are going to affect people .
and i need people around me to keep reminding me about how people are affected by the decision i made by the action that i take .
and it is a understanding what my blind spot are .
and helping people understand what their blind spot are when they are early in their career because i think you can step in a lot if you do not understand .
it is related to that selfawareness thing .
and then the last thing ill mention because it is something i usually also include in my coaching is that .
you can not do it all and most of the people that end up in a leadership role in the role in our people whove been pretty successful at some level at something .
and and they believe they can do a lot of stuff and i would have been one of those people .
but you can not do it all and when are you going to learn to trust other people to do important thing .
that need to get done and and we call it delegation .
but often by what we mean by delegation is is giving them something to do and then giving him detailed instruction about how i would .
and and one of the lesson i needed to learn wa to trust people give them a goal and turn them loose and you can not do it .
you got it you got to be able to trust people to do to do good work and the more i learned that the more successful i wa .
and it is great advice and a youve you built team roger you are your own team that you had at your respective institution .
you worked with other other other organization other company other college to help them .
bill team what to that to that point and maybe that is the point but is there anything else you can see is common .
and then you want to give them a bit of a to put call that maybe a leader can try to avoid or maybe focus on to build the .
team that that to complex whatever goal they are trying to .
yeah what one basic thing is to understand that when you are in a leadership role thats whats were called to do .
i think what happens is people get from i am a prime example .
they thought hey here a guy that wa a pretty good coach .
he recruited pretty .
maybe he can run in the mission off a . because you have the technical expertise to do something doesnt mean that you can oversee people to do that thing that you were good .
and yet most people get promoted because of their technical ability and not with much of a regard for their ability to manage other people to lead other people to motivate other people a you say to build team .
but they are plopped into a leadership role and they and what they do not understand is because you are a good recruiter or a good salesperson doesnt necessarily mean that you can lead people to do that or manage people .
thats a whole different skill set hiring people but people thats one of the skill that it took me i am still not sure i am very good at it .
but i think one of the thing i appreciate and what you said is sometimes you you are not sure you still figure it out ?
i think thats critical for u a human and u a leader to realize that we are not perfect and i think thereve been time at least in my career i thought yeah i got to ive got to figure it out ?
and and quite frankly thats when i started to fail thats when thing started to not go when i started limiting my personal growth my professional growth because i i thought i hadnt figured out .
in in that in that vein roger is there anything that any book or any resource that you may recommend to folk who are maybe starting out in that leadership role that helped help them blossom if you will .
yeah i got ton of .
i i tell you the three the three that i probably recommend the most i am a huge stephen covey fan .
even today even even in thing being a grandparent there thing that that are there a lot of wisdom in those seven habit of highly if if there are people out there never read that book i recommend it to almost everybody that i coach .
and then i am a big fan of drucker peter drucker and anything that drucker ha written i think he got he ha tremendous handle on managing people and and a lot of the principle that .
that i spout i guess would be the word is come from drucker i pulled him quite a bit .
and then the third one and this one wa later in my career but a book called leading change .
and i it .
and trying to remember the author name embarrassed that i can not but the title of the book is leading change because ive recommended it often those are three that ive been pretty commonly recommended .
thats the .
ive got to be a little bit better .
i think it is done .
thank you for that .
you mentioned earlier to about the self awareness piece now i think this go a little bit with something thats resonated with me a ive gone around and visited with with team and and you talked about .
or at least alluded to that burnout that .
and took some time away and miraculously it it healed with nothing and it wa the stress and it is amazing how stress will manifest itself in in your body .
physical body and is there is anything you could suggest in term of .
the mental health perspective for the young the the young and say they say out there that are that are that are new to this career field and making sure that they do not they do not burn out to early .
i told you a in this mentoring program this leadership program it is absolutely by far the most asked question is how how do i establish .
i work life balance that i am because i feel i am going to burn out if i keep it up at this pace and if i keep .
i am responding to the stress the way i am responding to the stress now every almost everybody ive ever coached or mentored .
in enrollment management ha asked that question at some level in some way and i there are no there are not a magic answer probably the most common thing and usually i try to get to know the personal life better before i give it .
in that end up in those leadership role and we we are we are motivated we keep grinding and do not even realize what we are doing to our body or to our mind and and that we are burning out until it is maybe too late .
but number one be conscious of it and by being conscious of it you can then intentionally set some goal for how much time have i got to spend with my spouse or my .
significant other or my kid or whatever how much set some goal about limiting certain .
a amount of work or making sure that you do certain thing that you enjoy doing that are going to relax you .
disciplining yourself to take vacation time even when .
it might be a difficult thing to do knowing what you are going to think when you get back and all of that but this point setting goal that are geared toward .
taking care of yourself in fact one of those seven habit that i wa talking about this team and cubby .
he talk about sharpening the saw he said think of yourself a a tool and how that tool is only effective .
if it is a saw it is only effective in sharpening if you do not take the time to stop and sharpen that saw .
work your tail off and not ever get anything done and thats what we end up going with our with our with in our leadership role we work crazy and do not realize why we are not getting it maybe it is because the saw got .
and and you need to keep it sharp and and that work life balance a part of that when we think we are going to for fit result .
if we take time off and relax and we take care of ourselves .
yeah i love that analogy and the sharpening of the fall for me personally a lot of that wa taking a week away doing some professional development going to a conference maybe getting a new new idea and in some way .
ive been to to a large extent we i think a lot of folk have tried their hardest to do conference virtually and i certainly miss the face of face conference and i think it .
to an extent we do not get the gatherer professional and talk about the challenge that we are facing in higher ed switching gear a little bit here but what do a some of the challenge that are being faced and in higher ed .
and i follow up to that question what is leader in higher ed can we do to help overcome those .
yeah i make the secret fault roger .
yeah i am yeah i get asked question about what what should be done after i retired the whole thing about .
what wa it where where .
there some thing that have come up since i wa in the field that i got i am an outsider thinking it through my own logic and then the pandemic came and i never had to go through a. when i would .
and role management i have to sit down and sort out .
i do not know that i have answer but i tell you one that hasnt changed is an old man especially for for small private college that is you talk about challenge that .
small private college are facing in and some of the larger room a is is enrollment whether it is because thats how your institution is funded your tuition ribbon and you are .
not getting enough student every year to make end meet or whether it is an access issue for for some larger .
institution that are necessarily doing it .
meeting the enrollment for for funding but enrollment is still a challenge is a challenge everywhere and it is .
the the challenge increased .
not because of covid but a we know that demographic cliff is coming in .
smaller private college have got to figure out how to compete for u piece of a smaller pie .
and and how do you get the same number of student if that guy is shrinking you are going to have to be getting student that other institution would have gotten before your competing .
and and some of them are already in a deficit mode and they set simply set the budget on what they need in order to balance their budget without any an idea is to how that might happen what change .
and we are talking about adaptive change earlier you get you got to make adaptive change in order for enrollment to .
to increase because if you keep doing the same thing the same way it is not always because your admission office are working smart or hard enough .
and but institution are going to set those budget and then enrollment people are going to be caught in that trap of .
and thats what the goal is but i honestly do not see any possible way that we could possibly but we are going to dig in and try and that whole cycle is still happening .
maybe happening more than ever because because of the chance enrollment is still one of the biggest challenge and i think itll continue to be .
i think for our senior we are thinking we will return it to the impact of different senior trust .
i think there .
make sense given my observation on college and university campus .
it is a little bit grandios but i think one of the challenge that higher education is facing now is the polarization thats occurring in our culture on social and political issue .
from an enrollment manager to standpoint where i take that is are we going to end up at some point ?
it used to be verboten for for me a an administrator to take a political position and and and preaches on my campus .
i wasnt supposed to do that .
we werent supposed to take a position politically or even on a lot of social issue a an institution .
thats what we are therefore we are there to have this type of discussion thats unbiased but now i am seeing institution who are putting a stake in the ground and saying we are this .
i do not know if it is that bad or not but ive heard other people talking about this being one of the thing that higher education is going to have to deal with and i do think it can affect enrollment management at some level .

canada dear dr. brown and bimmel capadia .
thanks for having u . thanks for having u . guy thank you much .
i know you are schedule is tight .
we have a lecture coming up in a few day .
taking a few moment that come down to the studio to say hi to u and talk to a little bit about what you plan to do .
once elected we do appreciate that .
by the way jeff bennett he wanted to stop by too but he had a prior family obligation which prevented him from attending .
jeff we love you too .
but in any case we do have a dear dr. and bimmel .
iliana i know you have nine hundred question for them .
but how are you guy ?
hows the stress level ?
it is been a wild ride but it is been gratifying .
and weve had an amazing time talking to everyone in our camp when weve been campaigning .
talking to our community i think ha been uplifting throughout all this .
i think we all underestimated a little bit of how much work go into the campaign while trying to manage your family while trying to manage work while trying to manage your own personal life .
but a dierger said it is been we are getting closer to the end here and a lot of the positive of the people weve met people weve met along the way people weve spoken with thing weve learned it is been it is been karen is through .
and by the way we have to give a big shout out to all the volunteer that have been helping u . absolutely .
theyve been all over the place .
theyve been canvassing for u . theyve been on the social .
theyve been helping u with merch with with with with punkards with flyer with whatever it may be .
this part is that part is easy .
they are making our part look easy with all this up yet .
there a lot of negative when you run for office because how time consuming is but the reward the rewarding aspect of it .
year from now youll look back and say it wa the volunteer that we met .
it wa a people along the way .
we met the issue that we addressed .
and yeah i certainly appreciate that because look you guy this is a volunteer work job if elected .
it is in a lot of way of stanclets .
in a lot of way people are going to say we are going to walk up to you to supermarket and walk up to you in town and they are going to say why can not you do this or that ?
stepping up to the plate is appreciated .
i guess my first question to you and then elie andres gon na ask all the other question .
thats how we roll around here on the selftax podcast .
what made you guy decide to run for office ?
thats the first place .
i need to go first. . when i first moved to maplewood i went to the board meeting all the time .
i do policy for a living .
i work for the government accountability office .
policy evaluation how to make government more efficient more effective work for the people is what i do .
i had what i studied .
and i thought this is the way i can give back locally .
when i went to the board meeting at that time they were still theyd go eleven twelve p.m. i had two little kid and i i couldnt take it on at that point in my life .
fast forward now my daughter last year wa the board of ed rep. and i had been following the board somewhat over the year but especially last year i followed it because she wa on the board .
and last year wa between the push to get rid of honor the the superintendent the that intense meeting in november the budget the cut to the art the cut to the teacher .
it wa a lot .
and i felt it felt to me a now or never moment in a way i think i know bimmels been feeling this way too .
it is what is going on ?
this doesnt reflect who our community is .
and i thought if it is now or never moment i have this skill set .
i have the time in my life now to serve .
let me try and help be part of the solution and get u back on track .
i the fact that you you follow any daughter footstep .
she love some big big foot to the end .
i would imagine shes mar i am not gon na come back to handle this .
but ill give them a hug .
i think for me a little bit similar in that ive got my kid entered the district during covid .
and they entered kindergarten and they were in preschool at the time .
and i think everybody wa forced to pay attention a little bit more to school .
what wa happening ?
whether it be on zoom or trying to do in person or some of the hybrid learning .
but a lot of the issue that were probably plaguing the district were coming to the forefront particularly with everything thats happening on the education side ?
and now you saw the fracture within the board of ed you saw the fracture with the leadership .
you saw the intentional distance that wa being put from the parent to the teacher .
something wasnt adding up .
and i think even if you a we got out of and dismounted covid parent that were involved did not rebound back .
they still stayed in a building .
you had to be a little bit more vigilant in term of whats happening .
i think a lot of these thing that youve taken for granted were no longer taken for granted .
and a a result i followed along a little bit more closer .
and the spirit to want to run probably happened with tony and jeffs run last year .
and i remember all of the thing that you said wow there an opportunity here to make some change .
they almost won .
they almost won .
and these guy they they were saying a lot of thing that we were thinking .
they were representing a lot of thing that represented what wa at stake .
some of the shortfall and the behavior and policy decision .
i went to a meeting agreed that where i i became a lot more interested in what they were saying .
and then who would have thought that that would have been ?
and when you are later but similar to what deerjer wa saying in term of where you are in your life .
and all this stuff is funny is we get into the end of this campaign run whether it is winner or lose .
and while we go through that journey we talked about i think a lot about now .
my mother wa a social worker .
and never paid attention to that a she wa an immigrant that came in and walked away from a lot of that life behind her .
but around this time my two older brother there wa one eight year old and the other is four year old in the me .
around the same age a that i am that now .
my brother started a nonprofit for overseas for african india an education and water water safety and water clean water .
my brother became chancellor of his alma mater .
and now here i am in the board of ed it is a it is a very uncorrected .
the very uncorred native unc communicated path that weve all ended up thinking about whats next in our life .
and this functional family calling .
it is an unintentional ?
it is an unintentional family .
and i will not reveal my age but i am starting .
but i am starting to think about whats next .
and i think this this board of ed run could be a signal of some thing that where i strongly believe in service .
and then service should be nothing thats shouldnt be short term of show is be a long term thing but what you need to step it at some point .
yeah and certainly ive told u before ive a friend of mine he in another township where there le focus on everything .
here we have a paparazzo and much to speak the village grain and and youve got the social medium site and everybody seems to know whats going on .
you have seven people running for office now .
he ran .
he and he said if id want to run for a board of ed he said ill run and he go congratulation .
yeah this town a little bit different .
yeah there a focus there a magnifying glass .
how are you finding that ?
are you finding your life is changed in a good way and in a not good way ?
you are thought on this one far and what youve experienced .
i think it is been on one hand .
i wasnt even on facebook before this campaign began .
in that sense ive been above the fray i think .
it is been some of whats been going on in facebooks been pretty disheartening at time in term of people saying thing about me that are certainly not true .
but when that happens i call them all or jeff and i say i am going to go out in canvas and it make me feel much better because i know the negativity that you might read .
it is a few people .
it is not and it doe not represent who we are in many by any mean .
and that it is been disheartening there but then when i go out and talk to people it is much the it lift me up much more .
it is been a little bit of a roller coaster in that regard .
but i wouldnt change it for anything because ive learned much from our community .
again i say this over and over .
it is it is awesome where we live .
we have many talented individual from all walk of life diversity by every definition of the word .
and i feel this is such a special opportunity to try and get our district to match that .
i drive up my street and i see all these sign and i it is warm .
i wa telling me the other day i wa i do not go to south orange very often but today that i went i wa surprised to see how many of your lawn sign long street .
i turn around more and i am guy got south orange .
it is a purple river .
yeah i wa a purple river .
how did you guy can not miss all those people ?
i am they are stepping it up here .
thats true .
yeah you what ?
one thing is hey ill take you alongside but they have to note it take you alongside .
that took the volunteer and yourselves and coordinating people to come out and say hey we got you back .
thats a i want to be a heck of a challenge .
it wa a challenge for sure but it wa one that we signed up for ?
and i think much of this wa knocking on door old school stud ?
we knocked on many door where somebody said i lived here for twelve twenty year and no one ever knocked on my door .
but for the board of ed i think theyve appreciated that freshness and putting a name to the face not digital avatar thats out there with a putting some personality behind it .
and go back to your earlier question of what we went what we learned out of this stuff .
this town is wild .
thats what .
for not being a involved in the in knowing the board and knowing all the different all the different pocket of communication that are out there learning about all these group all these different constituent or different plot line and different thing that are happening .
it is you are you are binging this content all the time trying to figure out how do i navigate this stuff .
and again this is south orange sooma is a microcosm of whats happening on our national scale and this is a board of election scale think about whats the thing about all the misinformation thats out there on the national scale .
talk about misinformation and i want to touch on this briefly but i do not want to spend too much time on it .
michelle obama once said when they go low we go high i feel your opponent went low with a flyer that they wa in their name they claim or a run at least told me he learned a bit a i learned of it .
directed at that you are running mate .
i guess we could running mate i guess what we called a running mate .
there wa a group of former board of bath and it endorsed the and while we were in bethany and they signed it and i did not yeah there wa some thats kindly .
it go debunked clearly debunked and that wa wrong and it ha no place for anything that it thought on on that .
there a car crash on that .
yeah you are about to see it .
and i think for a deal and by the way she should come in next year is i think thats where we thought this is unfortunate .
i think the one thing that everybody should remember all your listener is that that original flyer wa submitted to one of the local one of the local trade happened to tap or village green whatever wa any got rejected .
it wasnt it wasnt fact checked .
it wasnt second sourced .
and and oppo comment or a quote they put it up .
it wa they got to meet .
it wa a they put it up and then they realized quickly that it wa reckless .
and then they put up on their own website they doubled down a second time .
it is a realizing this wa inappropriate and wrong and and and and and and and not sense they they doubled down .
but they are afraid that they might get sued and thats why they took it down .
it is it is hard to say .
but i think the journalist he said now put it on .
it said board of ed stuff .
ill take it and then he said and this is the tap into a fred .
i know fred .
i think fred said we read it .
he wa nah not for me .
and then when when we looked at a little bit further we also saw that it wa a sponsored post .
look i come from medium journalist .
again some thing that are there .
but look at the end of it here the message that wa there .
and i do not we do not need to recap it because once you deposit that stuff it is stuff and people brain it stay there .
but this is a volunteer position .
you mentioned it is a fanceless position .
it is a volunteer position .
we are doing this for all the reason .
when you make insinuation that you put somebody career you put somebody family you put their friend you put a lot of thing at jeopardy .
at what cost doe winning mean to do that ?
i do think they even thought about that .
it wa they wanted to destruction fall .
i do not care what we are taking .
it is we are destroying it .
how do you feel brown is about this ?
i think that wa probably the lowest point of our campaign .
i feel bimmel said to blatantly put something out there that completely is misleading not the truth and can be life destroying .
wa it wa unbelievable because again i do not think it represents who we are a a community .
and i do not think it represents who we want a leader in our district either .
i think yeah i wa ambivalent to the whole process .
but when something that you are not them .
yeah that wa my thought .
not them .
if thats what they are going to do that doesnt work .
and i think that the back left backlash wa swift. . i think you saw you saw the community around me .
yeah everybody wa a line .
a rubicon wa crossed .
and now there no going back to that .
and are you surprised that having apologized to jeff about this ?
i thought they would put out a statement and say look i am sorry whatever .
we did not mean to go that far .
yeah i think they are could have been from both side because i do not know i do not know but i do not know i do not know i do not know .
but i think they were one of our own and nothing they havent apologized yeah .
they havent said we have nothing to do with this it feel they are supporting this .
which is disappointing .
sometimes you get to foreign tree .
have something to do with it .
thats yeah yeah yeah my number .
but i think hopefully do time theyll say wow .
and it is weak .
and it is weak .
we also at the debate the second debate we gave them a chance to denounce it and they did not take it .
now that wa a good opportunity to say something .
but moving forward if you get on the board when you get on the board whats the first thing you want to do ?
what did you want to do ?
what did you want ?
first thing you have to hand out .
whats the first thing you are going to do ?
that first thing if you could affect change immediately .
what would that be ?
the bargently .
the first bargently .
yeah i think the budget is number one .
you want to see the detail ?
what exactly are there spending money ?
if you do not have a sound budget if you do not have a budget that think over the year you you can not do anything .
and we have many issue .
we have to make progress on these equity recommendation .
there are special education department .
it is shocking how many story weve heard about how thats feeling many family and many student .
we can not and i think part of the budget also relates to the bossing situation because i think there is an opportunity there for some efficiency without changing the initiative without we support the intentional integration initiative and the rebalancing but we think we can do it smarter .
thats related to the budget .
yeah i think one of the first thing that we would do is i think we try and get that spirit of collaboration going again .
i think wed want to bring the people that felt outside inside again bring the teacher closer bring the student closer bring the parent closer to be the listening vehicle for that stuff .
and i think part of the reason why i also dear to nir running is that you can only do much from the sideline .
and i think by getting into the board of edu we are dealing with a much perfect information a possible .
and i think itll be our duty to be a transparent a possible to the community and try and get to the spot where we can if decision were being made why were they being made why wa it communicated in a certain way ?
again it is easy to shake your fist from the sideline .
yeah weve all done that ?
but let if the other night can get in there we are making our promise that we want to be accountable .
we want to be transparent .
we want to open the line of communication .
and by the way thats not a board of edu that thing .
thats anything .
i think a possible you guy can try to make the board transparent because i know you guy are aware about this invoice about hiring an outside person for the guidance thing .
and apparently half of the board wasnt aware that this wa happening .
and they did not know about the invoice .
you think it is possible .
you guy can make that the mystery seconded in the way .
i think is that what you are the other way they found it wa because of an old bra someone made .
we fixed this .
there more transparent .
that doesnt look .
it seems it wa in eighty threezero five hundred pay to an outside consultant .
eighty threefive hundred dollar .
and i guess it wa divided into two .
it wa divided into two .
it wa secretive .
it wa not secretive .
some people whats your take on that ?
whats your feeling about that ?
thats why i am talking about transparency .
how can we fix this ?
i think that a i do think that mr. bing i think weve to give him some grace ?
this what did not run here .
i think the first part of this did not happen on his watch .
i think i appreciated the message that he sent out .
i think he is trying to be more transparent in his communication .
he trying to be more candid .
and in our community even when you are transparent and candid you are going to get you are going to get hate ?
but having a board that will support his transparency and be transparent with him and try and be honest with him and be with him and the board admitting to mistake .
i think thats one of the thing that i feel i noticed with this situation with the director of guidance it feel no one is admitting to mistake ?
and and and i do not have an ego .
we are trying to do the best that we can .
and thats .
perfect. . and also being accountable to ourselves a leader hopefully by doing that we can then create lead by example in a way that other board member will act similarly. . with your child in mind again your parent your kid are in the school system now .
this is power .
this is the biggest your child .
the most important party of life and you are trying to give not only them but all these kid better opportunity in a school system .
thats been .
and the news rather regularly over the last couple year i friend in national news i wa a a news producer for a long time jumping hey you are school and the news again .
and hearing this for year .
there there trouble and paradise .
and i think you you can start to correct that by emulating the behavior that you want to see ?
with mr. bing is trying to get ahead of it trying to he doing the best he can .
yeah i am sorry .
he get he get he your eloquently said he deserves some grace .
he deserves time to get there .
but the leadership that he trying to showcase the board should reflect that .
and it is a trickle down ?
everyone should behave model their behavior off of that .
it is to get it wrong .
it is to sometimes it is not to get it wrong .
thats what you look .
you could have got ahead of it a lot earlier .
and i am sure if you were to ask mr. bing now he would if he wa looking back he would get what we do not maybe we should have done x y and z instead of whatever it is .
but we do not .
we are agreed that they should have hired that person to do the guidance canceler and you are talking about the consultant .
the consultant i am sorry .
yeah did you agree with that ?
or you would have handled it a different way ?
i would i would not have let go of somebody in order to have that same person be replaced by a consultant unless there wa a wide derelection of duty or there wa something that wa there .
i do not think that doe not seem to be the case .
people believe it wa a waste of money .
that that money could have used for that person to got left .
they could have used that for his salary .
we still got left with a lot of kid not having the class that they wanted .
we see line around the block of kid trying to get into class and i am reading online that some kid still do not have the class necessary to get in the college .
and i am i am i do not know if the spanish class or what but there there class kid are not in .
who the beaten ?
thats thats a scary situation .
i think that dropped the bowl here .
who do we think ?
it is hard to know because some people in the board seem they claim to know that they knew about they said that they knew about this .
i i do not want to speculate .
but i do agree what we spent pretty much seventy five of this guy salary or on this consultant .
and we got nothing essentially in return .
and this wa i think the director of guidance salary one hundred and thirty seven or something .
thats a full year of work ?
thats not putting together a master schedule .
what id to do is look forward .
at the last board meeting they presented this idea of the principle doing the schedule with two parttime counselor helping him and then we are going to reimagine the director of guidance role .
and it feel maybe we need to pause and take a look at what do we need a a district in term of getting our master schedule together if we need mental health make how do we make that part of it ?
but we constantly it feel we are constantly putting on band aid .
and we think about band aid for one year at a time instead of thinking it through .
even this new a reimagine director of guidance the first year they are going to be funded with a grant that we got a oneyear grant .
then i am thinking to myself how are you going to fund the person beyond this first year ?
and maybe maybe those question are being asked behind closed door but our trust is solo ?
the parent trust is low the teacher trust is low the student trust are low .
at this point we are at a place where we need to overcommunicate ?
that these people do not fill in the gap on facebook with false information .
i think thats where we want to try and come in is overcommunicating away and help the super overcommunicate .
and by the way it is not always misinformation ?
sometimes you need the citizen to fill in the gap correctly ?
i think weve got some very tenacious board watcher and people who care about the community that are trying to do the thing when they do not see it being done on the other end of it ?
it is not misinformation .
you need those warrior that are out there trying to dig through the garbage can and figure out whats going on ?
and thats and thats thats important .
yeah what if we hadnt what if someone hadnt oprah then for me ?
shatsin thats .

and we are back on the somatox podcast .
we are having great conversation .
all yeah .
yeah i am having the time in my life with deirdre brown .
hey it is our first candidate coming to our podcast final .
yes we do have candidate finally willing to sit down with u for these hard hitting question eliana .
i think you and i are the next sixty minute perhaps they are when they are coming up next on sixty minute .
i am working on a lot of these question .
when you guy were candidate did you guy see any other annex chair ?
well save that for the next summer talk podcast .
thats for a specific to the election .
thats a grated summer talk podcast ?
the afterhour summer talk podcast .
yeah i did see that .
how am i going to ?
but we wanted to talk about eliana .
you had a question about the teacher .
yeah yeah ive been to a couple of debate and it seems teacher thing is not talked about .
i know that now teacher are not very happy .
they are not even comfortable .
they do not know where they are going .
i am sure most of them are thinking of leaving .
there no .
there no .
there no .
what are they ?
what are they losing teacher ?
good teacher .
we are losing teacher around happy .
weve had rosio lopez on who the teacher union president and she say the morale is not high now .
the morale and now with this contract that it is not going on .
contribute their past it seems to be hey they be those better opportunity and other district and teacher who have the skill and the experience our head and the other district .
what are your thought on all that ?
i think we are in almost no member now ?
and the fact that a contract negotiation ha dragged out this long is it is almost an almost untenable .
in any negotiation weve said it before on the trail is that it shouldnt be something where either side is far away in their demand that it is going to take a long time to get to the middle .
you know where it is going to go ?
and i think what could have happened here in the beginning is we all know the teacher deserve a contract .
we all know they deserve a race .
we all know that we need to repreciate the teacher .
i do not think these thing are given and they are understood .
if you go into that in a negotiation you can get to the spot fast .
and it shouldnt become antiagnistic .
nor should you be using your social medium your own social medium or the public to use a negotiating leverage .
these are tactic that will pin each other pin people against each other .
and you lose sight of what you are trying to get done .
thats an unfortunate thing .
but i think for deer droneye over the campaign of getting to talk to a lot of the teacher .
we have .
weve been fortunate with that .
weve ... whats their feeling ?
what did you get from them ?
they are unhappy .
weve met with some certain certain folk in the called and we are and and yeah i think there is a overarching low morale in the sense of not being listened to or brought to the table or being even appreciated and supported .
one of the one of the thing that we learned and deer droneye a about this is that they hadnt been brought into any policy decision since two thousand and twenty .
these teacher are on the front line of most of the decision that get made from the administration and the district .
and there should be ample time and opportunity to bring them in on the upfront or get a chance for their feedback .
that is one of the first thing that we should try and correct ?
thats the football player coming off the field and you are not saying whats going on out there ?
what happened ?
you are a he is .
thats you asked the people that are in the that are in the mr. the battle in the middle of it .
and they are thats his two thousand and twenty .
thats thats thats amazing .
they feel they are blind .
they do not even know whats going on on the appreciate .
and yeah .
and i think weve already learned much and i would imagine well learn much more when on the board if we try and bring and bring the teacher in to talk about policy idea we have monitoring how policy are going .
they they gave u a lot of feedback about their experience with the intentional integration initiative .
thats a good thing .
better than them. . exactly .
when we had that question about meal for child and then them not getting their meal because they were moved to different school the teacher had talked to u about that before .
that question at the debate .
the breakfast .
yeah that they used to have in said four of them now that they changed to another school they do not get the breakfast .
and and little this is a very small example .
but one teacher wa talking about in their room the construction worker hung the hook up high and close together .
a the child can not reach them and b you are going to be spreading life. ?
and thats a very very small example .
but i think with the intentional integration initiative kid not getting meal kid not getting the special education support that should have followed them .
these are the thing that the teacher see every day .
and we should be absolutely tapping into their expertise and their experience .
and i think another part of going back to the teacher inpass is because our budget ha not been transparent for long .
we used to do more reporting publicly prior to two thousand and twenty than weve been doing under burnside .
i think there this also it go back to lack of trust .
because they do not necessarily believe that the district doesnt have the money .
no one know ?
where are the money ?
yes i have the community i believe we have the money and the other half of the money .
we do not have the money .
a lot of teacher they have the money .
and they are holding into it .
what are your thought about that ?
you can not blame them for their logic ?
play it out .
say there a there a budget shortfall .
you have the the reduction in force .
you talk about supply being cut teacher being cut power professional being cut director of guidance being cut .
but yet we can find 83k for a consultant .
and you do not have a contract yet and you are worried about where the money is going or where it is coming from .
of course the teacher are going to make the money .
and they are higher the power a a gun and they are higher the power a a gun .
again those thing that you can not of course you can draw a line through that stuff and you can not you can not fall for the logic of wondering is there something there ?
and again communication knowing whats if you have an opaque budget process for the last few year you are you are going to be you are only dealing with the information thats being handed to you and then otherwise you are digging for it .
a little shout out to marshall school and the teacher there .
i am friendly with quite a few of them .
these are two candidate now that have you back .
hey shout out to marshall and we have marshall shout out to marshall and we have marshall and we have marshall but thats specifically marshall .
these are concern that they have .
i think you well have their own concern .
yeah and ill ill add my daughter ha had some i am my both my kid have had some amazing teacher but at the high school and i am i am worried that my son who an eighth grader will not have have those teacher .
i think thats how how low it is feeling now .
yeah yeah this look the the i am willing to take if i wa to have a unofficial polling of of resident in south orange maplewood i guarantee you a lot of parent would be able to name most of their teacher growing up .
and i would guarantee you that they could not name hat and you have a many of their boss after they had graduated .
thats true .
thats true .
this we all know that teacher are leaf such a high impression a to shaping of who you are what you want to be how to behave .
they after the parent they are the the the people that are seen and on the front line of what your child is going through in shape .
and they are tattoo in your memory ?
of your life .
you have to try to remember the last ten world series winner .
you can not do it but you can not remember the top ten teacher .
yeah you could list it probably real quickly .
i know i can not mr. hunt top of the list you miss colbert .
mr. hunt hey hey .
i am keeping i am not on facebook a much and stuff .
i would be more because of the campaign .
but the only person i wa seeing touch after all these year more than some of my high school friend wa my art teacher for my school .
and that thats something to be said .
thats again i am not gon na date myself too .
and thats almost thirty year later .
and you are still in touch .
you should call mr. and on .
it is always a a parent a quick tangent i always feel very weird when i meet my kid teacher and try and call them by their first name .
yeah it is a new one .
i want to be yeah .
i am the selfadmisturizing .
how are you doing ?
it is not the ethical .
you call them first name ?
i go and miss it .
i go and miss your miss .
it is the end of the game .
thats funny .
i am doing a special book called the bull .
you are a teacher .
you are that your title mr. yes yes .
unless it is doctor .
but thats usually it is in the college level ?
all of a sudden but i am a school district and the parent always refer to me a mrs. castellia .
they never do my first name .
i guess the question is mrs. castellia .
it is respect .
if they are probably not my fouryearold i can not go to the school .
i feel wrong when they do the mrs. castellia .
she wa why do not you call me man ?
because you were forty year older than her .
but she did not that .
i shouldnt have told that .
but getting back to what we are talking about .
and i hope i am not throwing a curveball at you .
the the the the you were again by your opponent .
it seemed they said something about you not having frank sanchez a back during that whole mess .
and that wasnt true .
much sharing a little bit about that whole situation .
you were a friend of frank .
we are all in term of purpose .
a many of u in the community .
i am friend with frank and i am a friend of frank. . how you talk to frank ?
mr. sanchez ha been great with my daughter in the high school .
they have such a wonderful relationship especially because if they are working together when she wa on the board .
but regardless of that if you are here in the high school mr. sanchez there wa not an event that you went to that he wa not he is not there whether it is martin luther martin luther king day celebration a football game a chorus concert .
he is our high school biggest cheerleader in fan .
and i think he ha brought this sense of community and pride that ha been lacking .
and he seems to be able to relate to many of the student .
he when when what happened last year happened i wa i wa extremely upset .
it wa i think he wa his treatment wa terrible by our district .
and i wa a big friend of frank .
i went to the rally .
i posted and asked other people to donate .
certainly when i wrote about that and said i guess i said i wa a proponent of friend of frank .
and i think verbally i said i wa a supporter .
i wa there .
i meant i wa a huge supporter of that initiative .
i am very appreciative of the people who started that initiative .
and you were responsible i made the group .
but you were on support .
you were there .
when he got retired i am sure you have the many others in the community .
you had your fist pumped in the air. . and i think i certainly it is me saying i am a huge supporter of kamala harris. . i do not think anyone assumes that i am meaning i am running kamala harris campaign. . where you are done ?
thats how i viewed it .
that might be easier by the way. . and then running before the bad end i am about to run .
but no i did not intend for it to come across that way .
and i am appreciative to those people because that wa a that wa a great campaign .
i think it showed the community support .
and much of our community love mr. sanchez .
and what he done for the high school .
he back .
and i think you were a big part of that .
thank you for supporting him .
the kid love him parent love him .
not everybody .
everybody i speak to speaks to the world of them .
very few people ive met have anything negative say but i am going back to you guy .
because he got his job back .
got to get to your job .
is there anything that seen hall today .
i am telling myself i am asking a good question .
see hall prepped today had an incident .
it wa it wa a lockdown .
i am not exactly sure about the specific but obviously it wa very frightening for the child .
it turned out to be the police were nothing happened not quid .
security a big concern with our school system too with our school .
what do you thought on security ?
are we secure enough ?
do we need more security ?
how do we protect these kid ?
it is a dangerous world today .
and this this is a question brought up last night by a student at the debate .
and today i had a i had a friend text me saying is everything at the school maplewood school .
and i i immediately i wa shaking .
i thought it wa the columbia high school then i found out it wa seen hall but i wa shaking .
weve many people in our community their kid go to school there .
yes thats true .
it brought it home .
for the past three year the student board representative have brought up security a a number one issue to our board of education and to the superintendent .
many time and still we still we still are not taking it a a i think we need to .
last year there were kid that came into the school .
we had a kid come into the school a week or two ago .
a a member of the board i hope that i would love to work with mr. valice .
i think he the head of our security .
i am sure he ha got wonderful idea on what more we can do .
i think itll involve having security guard that are trained possibly thinking about what are those security guard paid ?
certainly they should be paid in the amount commensurate with the importance of the job .
we need standard operating procedure and we need expectation .
i think i am not sure what the high school is where kid are now but last year kid were expected to wear their idea but i do not think that wa an expectation .
kid did not wear their idea .
and if no one wearing idea you do not know who is should be in the building in who shouldnt be .
and i do not know where that is today hopefully it is better but security i do think need to be taken .
yeah and i think it is one of those unfortunate reality that we are in now .
and everything that weve heard far and what happened at ceten hall obviously thankfully nothing serious happened but protocol were followed .
it sound the student knew exactly what they needed to do .
again unfortunately that ha to be a routine that they need to practice but the student knew what they had to do .
protocol were in place the police responded accordingly .
that there an upside in term of at least that there wa something in term of something might have worked .
god forbid that wa going to be a grim reality .
again it still stink that this is the one that we have to live in .
it is always heartbreaking when number outside the window and why that ha to be the case now which is also unfortunate .
but we are a lot of these security thing for me having two kid in elementary school .
it is a bit new of hearing a lot of this stuff because when i go john my kid thats south mountain it look pretty secure .
it look thats the thing .
but again i who know who happens at the high school level when you have when you have and they should they should have mobility .
the kid should be able to room free .
they should be able to do the thing that they need to do a teenager ?
we all remember what it wa growing up in .
i know lady you said that you went through the window .
i said that when yes it is a climate of second the english class wa second floor .
you could jump out and it wa bush there .
and we used to do all the time .
i could say we have to jump up .
i could say with confidence at least two of u in this room have done that .
and then youd have to go around .
that wa you have to go through the door and help the principal .
but now you wouldnt get in quickly .
did you have your help from a jew then ?
the jew from the jew .
i used to have a jew from which is jewish curly hair .
and she called whats you called from ?
ive heard from you .
but anyway it wa yeah a you could see it is long gone .
yes but back in the day i had a wonderful head of hair .
i do not think anybody ha to worry about shooting in every now .
well go in and out and that .
no you never never crushed your mother .
the good old day .
but we were young and beautiful .
it is hard to be a kid now that it wa a weird one .
even the id i know the kid have the with the id is my kid when he left for school he twenty five now .
but i i wa if your head wasnt attached to your shoulder you forget that too .
he would forget his book bag .
hed forget the homework .
he would my daughter .
two sneaker .
those are not matching sneaker .
and now you are asking to bring an id also .
it i understand the issue but you will put in the burden on kid to put it on .
but you are going to want that .
the idea they have to be vigilant .
they have to have their they had on a swivel .
they have to understand all these thing .
why can they leave the id at school ?
because in the school district where i work the teacher collect them when they are leaving .
they collect the idea when they come back and they give it to them .
that way it doesnt get lost .
maybe they should do that .
you perhaps my daughter many time i have to drive the id to my daughter because they will not let her go .
and i guess it is a time consuming situation especially without having to what how many kid are in the columbia ?
i got the thousand three time .
it is a little city ?
and also it is take a lot of time to .
i think we need to it is many thing in our district .
take a step back and look at what we are doing .
what are other district doing and doing ?
and how do we copy that ?
and the id maybe that is i do not know .
maybe that is a good way to do it .
yeah they collect them .
but what is is whats your message to the thousand of family in the community ?
and many of them maybe private school maybe maybe this is not working .
whats your message moving forward to these parent that i said maybe i get to get my kid out of the school system ?
what would you say to them if they you are not going to door and i said i think i am taking my kid out .
what do you think i should ?
i know there many of them in seeding seed and prep a lot .
i think thats why we are running .
in a way i think we see that .
weve felt it in some way ourselves .
why can not why is our district not serving all of our kid ?
our community awesome .
theyve sent their kid to private school .
they do not want to move because they love our community .
but it is a shame that you are paying for these tax and you do not feel you are your school can serve your child .
and for u it is help come on board with u . we are parent .
we are the voice of parent .
we can bring that to the board .
and it is about level setting in a way .
it is level setting the temperament of the board working with the superintendent .
and then getting back to basic the bushing the budgeting scheduling guidance .
these are thing that are very every school district ha to do on an annual basis .
and we seem to be faltering with it in recent year .
and i think if we can get those thing on track .
and by the way we need to get those thing on track because we havent .
we do have these important equity recommendation .
we have these important special education recommendation .
we have to rebuild our art program .
we have to be able to provide athletic facility for all of our student .
this is part of being a school district .
and for u it is let recenter .
it feel in recent year we to throw thing on the wall and see if they work .
and we do not think them through .
we do not think them through one more planning .
and we do not think through every single ramification of them .
and i i think for u well bring that temperament of let bring people in .
let think of idea .
and let workshop these idea all the way through before we start to implement them .
and then when we implement them let make sure the teacher are prepared to implement them .
let make sure the administration prepare to implement them .
and then a we are implementing them let use data to see what are our goal .
are we making progress ?
these are thing that you do when you are implementing policy .
it is not it is not rocket science but it seems weve struggled with that in recent year .
and i and i if we can do that i truly believe we have we have such a wonderful community .
we have a chance at a new beginning with a new superintendent .
it feel with the leadership behind him which is thoughtful which is accountable transparent bringing together the people that have been felt the parent the teacher the student that have been left out on the sideline .
it feel we we can get back on track .
and we can not serve all of our student .
yeah i think when the what we owe it to ourselves to have the district match the community ?
it is what we all talked about .
it is what we all strive for .
and if we can get those basic then let it be a decision what they make is for their kid .
because by the way not every kid is built for public school .
sometimes it might make sense to go to boarding school or private school whatever it is that they had that access they had that choice to do .
fine but let not make it because there no other option because theyve given up on the public school system .
when you give up on the public school system it is a downward spiral for everything .
and it is hard to get out of that ?
this is a spot now and due to set it perfectly with everything that we are talking about in term of our campaign .
this is that moment ?
we are at an inflection point .
you hear that a lot at the federal level at the nation level and all that stuff but it is in our town .
this is a critical critical moment in term of where we decide to be a a district .
the stake are high .
the voter have a choice .
they know the thing are important for them .
and we have to reflect that .
and you can not do it by having division .
you can not do it by divisiveness ?
i think the community is ready .
there we are playing i am telling you there a lot of the i do not have the drama i do not have the transparency .
and the negative the negativity the negativity not that is it i read someone and post online they should all go and have a clean slate with nine and the fresh people .
if you can close your eye and think for a moment what the district should look youll quickly find out that it is worth saving it is worth fighting for and it is worth voting for .
yeah we have a choice and it is not when we talk about that putting your stomach that we said at the top ?
we all got that a little bit .
and the parent talked about that last night asked about the drama going on can you ?
and yeah the response wa a little weak ill be honest with you .
i wa hoping that someone not talking about you we talked about the others that are in the thing i wa hoping no we did not know more drama i wanted to feel that .
they are we are willing to do that .
because a lot of people feel the fortivist divided into you got the soldier warrior group and then you got the other group .
and then thats where the victory start because they have their own agenda and then there another agenda ?
id say look a agenda is thats a tough work ?
it wa when you came to help .
but what you did is they got their being influenced by the social group .
and a people that you think they are influenced and they are absolutely .
this politics this politics exactly .
on a local level which i think ha gotten a little out of control thats my take .
i do not know if we have it .
are you going to be those board of eight ?
you are going to call them out ?
thats not .
are you going to be that ?
are you going to be the quiet one ?
i am not going to touch that .
i am not putting you in this spot .
but some people to see that .
theyve been called out if they did not see it .
yeah i think look i think deer going to have the tone tenor temperament to have polite discord .
it doesnt mean putting somebody it doesnt mean talking at doesnt mean talking down to it doesnt mean negative body language .
it doesnt mean gaslighting or whatever behavior that we might see out there before .
but it is taking it head on and calling them out .
and by the way we would expect the same thing .
deer your own i and jeff would expect the same exact thing .
if we were saying something incorrect or behaving incorrectly you got to be able to .
what are you about you guy ?
you guy are very approachable .
even though i did not know you guy you guy did not have that cold front .
there a approachable compare to you .
because yeah they are .
yeah they are .
they are very lovely people .
people come and if you are basing in vote on them being lovely they are lovely but they are also a you can hear they know what they are talking about they are prepared they are ready to go .
i can vote for a candidate that ignores me or do not give me the minute to hear me out or anything .
i am sorry if you give me the wrong look and you pas by i am not giving you my vote .
but i have the most important question to me the night and many people are talking about it on the social medium site on the long side how did you decide whose name came first second and third ?
thats everybody want to know .
thats a great question .
a theoretical order is not it ?
no that would be bennett brown capadia .
you guy did it out for a better quarter or no ?
your brown bennett brown .
yes brown because the way thats for him .
it wa chivalry .
yeah thats fine .
you had to be in the bean and you are i guess i am last .
it is a ring on with the fun section .
i know you guy are on time .
you got thing you got to do .
but you have a minute for elianas fun with the question .
yeah shes a good thing .
i wa asking her people personal question .
thats me mrs. noz .
you have a favorite restaurant and hopefully it is coded or sponsored .
if you had plenty of people but the code understands that there are other restaurant too .
and he dying to be here .
for me and buy is here but whats a favorite place to go ?
hey let go over there .
you are going to .
where am i running for a cold beer ?
i will say pepper cold beer .
but it used to be reservoir pizza .
it wa a wonderful .
it wa a casual link .
casually you got to respect that .
do not i never know where to park anymore ?
because that grab a lot .
i am always breaking the law a little bit when i go there .
but bunny pizza ha a lot of time spot .
thats a classic .
thats great .
ive only discovered it maybe a couple month ago .
shes always sitting there and shes there on the on the taking the order .
yeah i have to get her out of there .
if you introduce yourself shes lovely .
i have to introduce yourself .
she will never forget her .
i am in a business with there .
i am getting we we we there for that .
but i might have been a little hard to get a pizza that day .
but yes sabatinos he opened what five six year ago .
and he yeah he got to go on on .
we live some talented people in this community .
and and our school are some two very you go to the the site there the the the the people who lived here a long time ago whatever remember when we lived in southart they talk about this place glowingly .
talk about the restaurant and and where they went after school and grunnings ice cream and i do not know if kid today are going to have that same thought moving forward .
it is been a rough last couple of year .
but it this a you said this is a wonderful community .
and and we are happy wonderful people are want to want to the next generation of leadership .
and i think thats what you guy represent .
yeah and i think i do think that our kid there is a sense of community here ?

hello english learner welcome back to another podcast here with u at englishpod .
my name is marco .
and today we are bringing you another part of our sport series and this time it is an advanced lesson .
thats we are heading to the mountain today to take a skiing lesson .
alright we are going to be learning about skiing a winter sport and very popular throughout the world .
but before we get started why do not we take a look at a couple of word in vocabulary preview ?
vocabulary preview .
alright we are going to hear these two word in our dialogue .
the first one is fresh powder .
fresh powder .
fresh powder .
powder we probably know this phrase already .
yeah but here we are talking about fresh light snow .
fresh light snow snow that recently fell .
the best kind for skiing on .
the best kind .
alright fresh powder .
what about our next phrase ?
we are also going to meet a fourtime giant slalom champion .
alright a fourtime giant slalom champion .
giant slalom is a type of ski race .
when you probably see it on tv when they go down the hill and they have to go through these red or blue flag ?
now a fourtime giant slalom champion mean he won the giant slalom four times. . this is an interesting way of saying that somebody did something many times. . i can say the threetime nobel prize winner .
yes exactly. . or the fivetime olympic gold medalist .
now it is time for u to go to the mountain with our famous rick field and bob copeland and well see what happens .
welcome ski lover of all age .
my name is rick field and here with me is the man that need no introduction bob copeland .
thank you rick .
what a beautiful day here in aspen colorado where the sun is shining and weve got twelve inch of fresh powder .
it doesnt get much better than this .
thats bob but today we have a special treat for our viewer .
we are joined here by ian russey fourtime giant slalom champion .
and on this special edition of the show ian is going to teach u the basic of skiing .
let hit the slope .
first off let get those boot on .
you are going to want to make sure your boot fit snugly .
now snap them into your binding .
and you are also going to want a good pair of goggles to protect your eye .
it is a bright day today there going to be a lot of glare out there on the slope .
we do not want you hitting any of those mogul .
bob since you are a beginner skier and might take a few spill it is a good idea to have a good warm pair of dry ski glove .
easy there rick .
let head over onto the chairlift and test your skill .
all we are up here on the bunny hill .
bob why do not you do a few snow plow turn ?
gnarly run rick .
that wa sick .
you want to see gnarly ?
see that bump over there ?
i am going to catch some major air .
thanks for joining u here today .
i think that about doe it .
we are off to grab some freshies .
pretty embarrassing for rick there wasnt it ?
yeah he wa a little bit cocky .
and then he ended up falling .
i think there a lesson in that for all of u . but what the real lesson is today is language .
why do not we start with language takeaway ?
all on language takeaway today let take a look at the first word .
we have some binding .
binding are a lock that attache your boot to your ski .
those are the binding .
i guess it come from the verb to bind .
to tie something that it stay .
for example my binding are broken. . and another piece of skiing equipment and very important is goggles .
we have goggles now .
yep not to be confused with google .
it is spelled almost the same way ?
goggles are imagine a big pair of glass that you wear when you ski .
it make people look fly .
they have these huge glass .
and youll also see safety goggles which you might wear if you are a mechanic fixing a car or someone working with wood or chemical or what have you .
goggles protect your eye from snow from the sun from anything .
moving on to our next ski word .
they said you should wear the goggles that you do not accidentally go over the mogul .
it sound strange .
what are these thing ?
these are the bump that are in a ski hill .
they are mini little hill .
and they are very difficult to ski over ?
you got to be pretty good to handle those moguls. . and since these guy are beginner skier they are starting out on the bunny hill .
the bunny hill .
the bunny hill is the easiest hill .
it is where the beginner start to learn .
yeah all the kid .
all the kid are on the bunny hill .
and our final word .
we are going to look at two word here because they mean almost exactly the same thing .
we heard the ski instructor say gnarly .
yeah gnarly .
it is spelled gnarley .
and a related word sick .
now sick mean to be sick ?
let listen to some example to help u understand .
those were some sick dance move .
example two .
jack and i went to the beach yesterday and surf some gnarly wave .
example three .
man the concert last night wa sick .
i can not believe we got front row seat .
gnarly and sick they mean that it is amazing .
it wa cool .
these two word are very very informal .
both of these word i think originated with skier snowboarder skateboarder .
thats all the word we have for language take away but we have some great phrase that we want to take a look at before we listen to the dialogue again .
it is time now for fluency builder .
fluency builder .
all rick said that it is time to ... rick invited everyone to start skiing by saying let hit the slope .
to hit the slope .
to hit the slope .
now we want to hit the slope .
what doe that mean ?
let go to the mountain .
now we can change the noun slope for something else ?
yeah you can change it for a lot of other different noun .
and why do not we hear some example of how you can do that ?
i have to hit the book and study for my exam tomorrow .
example two .
i think i am going to hit the bed now .
example three .
honey can we hit the supermarket on our way home ?
great great example and now we understand how we can use the hit the something .
what about our next phrase ?
rick warned bob that he might take a few spill .
to take a spill .
to take a spill .
it mean a light fall or ... pretty dramatic fall .
for example instead of saying that little girl wa riding her bike and she fell i can say that little girl wa riding her bike and she took a bad spill .
yep. . to take a spill .
to use the verb take though .
yes exactly .
you can not spill. . you have to take a spill .
what about our next phrase ?
you might take a spill when you catch some major air. . catch some major air .
to catch some major air .
am i catching something ?
how am i catching air ?
thats impossible .
imagine if you are jumping and your ski are catching the air. . i am in the air for a very long time maybe ?
to catch some air it is you are flying for a couple second .
you are flying for a couple of second .
you are very high up in the air .
yep. . to catch some air .
they finished skiing .
they were tired .
let call it a day .
to call it a day .
it is over .
let finish the day .
let call it a day and go home .
but not before we go to our next word to grab some freshies .
grab some freshies .
grab some freshies. . freshies .
what are these freshies ?
remember we talked about fresh powder ?
it is that .
it is an informal way of saying fresh powder .
fresh powdery light snow. . freshies .
the snow that nobody ha skied on before .
good phrase and some amazing vocabulary .
let listen to this dialogue one last time and then well come back and talk a little bit more about this fun sport .
welcome ski lover of all age .
my name is rick field and here with me is the man that need no introduction bob copeland .
thank you rick .
what a beautiful day here in aspen colorado .

i am going to catch some major air .
thanks for joining u here today .
i think that about doe it .
well have to grab some freshies .
we heard the guy talk about aprèsski and this is one of my favorite part of skiing .
what is this ?
it sound french .
yeah it is .
i guess the frenchness give it an air of specialness ?
but aprèsski is the party that you have after your finish skiing .
it is popular for family to go to a ski resort and stay there for a couple of day .
this is when you would do this with your friend or family .
and what ?
if it is with your friend it is going to last until late into the night .
it sound fun .
and next time maybe if you go skiing with your friend and you guy are speaking english now you can use all these great phrase and maybe surprise your friend if you tell them let go grab some freshies or something that .

yo yo of the new american manufacturing renaissance .
whats going on man ?
whats up my man ?
yo i am excited to be here bro .
i do not even know if ive been a fan since you launched and ive been seeing all of the dope people that you had on here .
and i am glad that we can make some time to get able to sit down and chop it up and get on the episode bro .
respect man .
you are moving all across the country .
you are innovating .
you are bringing an important message across america that speaks to economic global mobility and listen man it is we are recording this in october which is manufacturing month .
i know you are busy on tour but i got some time for me please .
i am glad we were able to do it man .
and shout out manufacturing month shout out all the manufacturer that are listening to this podcast .
shout out to the people that did not know that it wa manufacturing month .
and now they do make sure that you get in tune with some activity that are going on next year .
it might be too late by the time you hear this podcast but now that it is on your radar and it is on your map locking with the manufacturer and community they want to show you some love every october .
one hundred percent man .
before we get too deep into into all of that man i want to know whats whats your origin story ?
i am from st. louis missouri and you alluded to on the intro man i wa a teenage father a two time felon .
and i wa in a position where my single mother wa working three or four job and we still couldnt pay the rent and keep the license on at the same time .
and at a young age that made a mental marking me to where i felt people shouldnt work and struggle at the same time .
there no way that you should have a job or multiple job and not be able to afford at least the bare necessity for people .
and a a young man from our area trying to figure this out i did not have a lot of positive role model or people that were looking to help me figure out what it wa that i wa good at .
and i wanted to help my mother at the same time .
i hopped off the porch early to speak .
and those thing led to making decision for now and not having a long term vision and a long term plan .
i found myself at eighteen with no real job prospect no real skill no understanding of what i could be .
and i had f some of my report card of life .
i have felony and amout of fee .
wa in that cycle of committing crime getting locked up getting back out missing court day having war running to different state doing different stuff .
then eventually i got tired and not tired for myself but i saw my son starting to mimic some of the thing that i wa doing .
and it left a bad taste in my mouth i decided that whatever it looked i did not know what i wanted to do ?
i did not know what i could do .
and sometimes thats enough .
knowing what you do not want to do can propel you towards the person that you can not be .
i knew on the inside i wa bigger than who i wa being now .
i knew that there wa a bigger picture in life for me .
i did not know what that looked but i knew i did not want to keep doing what i wa doing .
i put the word out that i am looking for a job .
it wa the height of the recession at the time .
it wa no job out here .
definitely no job for a teenager with no education and no skill that were transferable for anything .
if you remember at the time i remember people with master degree trying to get job at mcdonalds .
and it wa it wa tough .
the job market wa scarce .
plus it wa more scarce not having skill having all these thing going against me .
and someone wa look i can get you a gig or i can get you an interview .
it is not necessarily a guarantee for a job .
and i wa what is it ?
and they said it is a machinist .
and i wa i do not have no idea what that is .
but if it is paying and you can give me an interview thats all i need .
i need to talk to somebody across from me and i can get this job .
i go into this shop this warehouse looking thing i come in and they give me a test .
not an aptitude test but it had different measuring tool and instrument on there that they used to do the job .
and i failed that side of the test .
i did not have any idea what those tool were how to use them how to read the reading on there or anything .
on the backside of the test though there wa measurement a eighth three eighth a quarter saying it .
from my last job in the street i did on that side .
i knew all of that stuff .
i clowned on that side and he offered me a job on the saw ?
and in the saw situation wa taking raw material in the shop cutting it down to a specific size adding another one quarter of material on there and then taking it to the machine .
then the machine could be programmed to cut out whatever we are making out of the metal ?
and having that job gave me hope .
i might not know what i can be but this is something to hold on to .
i cut that metal it wa a million dollar of cut .
hey i know you are enjoying the episode quick .
drew ha something that he want to offer you for free .
drew tell him about it .

if you are looking to get into the industry the mfg hustle blueprint is for you .
can i know those workbook and start your success today ?
back to the episode .
i started showing up and i saw these machine making they were taking a big piece of metal and they are cutting it down and making more money off of it .
and i wa in awe because again referring to my last job at the time we were adding to raw material and stretching it and trying to make money. . that wa the first thing that already had me my mind going .
the second thing wa how are these machine operating with nobody in front of them ?
and what are we making ?
and they told me that we were making noncontact bearing isolators that went into fighter jet .
and at that point i felt my job matter .
when i wake up every day i am a part of the bigger picture in america .
i got a part in keeping our country safe .
this wasnt too long after nineeleven .
patriotism wa big and growing up black sometimes america .
there a different america that you live in ?
we sometimes we struggle to find our place .
that got me in the game .
that got me excited about manufacturing and engineering and making thing out of raw material .
i showed that excitement and working and put my head down .
eventually they sent me to college to get bachelor and master degree in digital design and engineering .
i went to mit .
i worked for a lot of the biggest brand out here making everything from lamors big combine for john deere to stealth fighter jet for boeing different place that .
from there i got to teach .
people started hitting me up and saying hey man our industry is old .
we need some younger some new blood in here .
and we are not able to recruit and bring people in .
people forgot what we do .
we need a voice and we need a person that look what the kid are interested in now .
and we need to make manufacturing sexy again .
i wa able to get out here and build a platform and use my platform to show kid why we can make america make thing again and why we should be doing that .
thats such a powerful story .
i think you may have delivered one of the best origin story ive had on the .
i am thinking about i am thinking about one time someone mentioned their grandmother and it wa it got emotional .
but you took u on a beautiful journey of i am thinking about resilient .
and we talk a lot about the durable skill on the podcast the thing that i work for u are looking for .
and a you were talking i can not help but think about i put one word around that story is resilience .
i am curious to you for those who may be listening or want to share strategy around resilience can you speak to that a little bit man ?
absolutely man .
and i think to be honest at the time when i wa building up my resilience i wa too eager to know what i am saying ?
and it wa look i am going to get knocked down .
i know these thing might happen .
but a long a there a little bit of hope that i can stand back up and i can stand i am going to be .
or if i even got to get on my knee what i am saying ?
and eventually stand up i am going to be but nothing going to stop me from getting my getting myself to wherever i need to be or whatever goal that might be .
it might look different my pathway there .
it might everything is always going to be obstacle in life .
and once we understand that then we understand that it is another obstacle ?
it is not it is not definite .
it is not finite ?
that wa the mentality that i had .
and i did before i had that mentality .
i knew that i did not have any other choice .
it is either i kept going or i am going backwards .
and if i go backwards i wa already a rock bottom .
i am going to be locked up or i am going to get smoked .
to for lack of better word .
but a long a you do not continue the back slide then youll continue to stack wins. . and a you stack win you can look back and thats a testament to your resilience. . you start seeing that yo this did not take me out .
that did not take me down .
this did not stop me .
and once you start seeing thing that are familiar that you remind yourself yo that wa another thing i hopped over .
or you start getting that that vision in that foresight and you can start seeing these thing coming and you can hedge for those. . and you can say hey i know that these curveballs are going to come .
i am going to work on my curveball hitting. . and when the curveballs come you are smacking them out of the park .
or you can you could be able to see thats not my pitch to speak .
it is a journey .
it is something thats built a you are walking on the journey but you got to understand that the beauty is in the journey and not necessarily in wherever you think that finish line or that goal may be .
yeah respect .
thank you for thank you for sharing that .
and no doubt going in on it .
i wanted to ask you i had one other follow up question to that .
and doing a research the name of donnie ogil came up .
is that your mentor to help ?
speaking to .
donnie wa the person that gave me my first job .
talked about going into that shop and giving me the test .
and donnie wa an old white man from the stick ?
and him and i had nothing in common on the outside .
and when i went and sat down in that meeting or in that first interview i he i do not know how he did it or what he had in him to see in me .
potential i had in the fact that i needed this job whatever it wa going to be .
and that wa all i needed to hear .
a soon a he told me that there wa something else on the other end of this and that hell help me get there i knew that he believed in me .
that made me start believing in myself .
if he think i could be a machinist if he think i can program these machine i never i never even seen one of these thing in my life .
and i did not know what an engineer wa .
i did not know what 3d design cad cam any of these higher level concept were .
but he wa at a high level and looked down and saw something in me and knew that i could do it .
and sometimes thats all you need ?
you need someone to say hey i know that this is in you because ive been here .
and let me show you how to get here .
now i think thats powerful what you said .
sometimes when people may find themselves in situation where they are uncertain or lacking the confidence and you do you need someone to transfer their belief in you on to you no i see what is possible in you .
and i think thats thats powerful that it .
one thousand percent .
and he took it another level ?
that wa another thing that i think made me receive what he wa saying wa now only do i see it in you .
here clear step on how to start becoming the you that we both know that you can be. . by empowering me not mentorship but sponsorship .
hey we are going to pay for you to go to school .
we are going to do this this this and this .
now i feel he not .
this is not lip service .
they are helping me become because a lot of time you do not know what you do not know .
and we have the burden on the people to to realize their potential .
and they got no idea on even how to take the first step .
we tell people you could be all you could be .
how do how doe that work ?
what doe that look in action ? .
and that is one of the reason why i launched the new american manufacturing renaissance tour what i am saying ?
because i saw that while i wa working at ranking we had a lot of kid in the city of st. louis that were coming to take tour and they were being pushed to automotive ?
or they are being pushed to construction or thing that people know a lot about plumbing maybe ?
and i would go to these kid that were on these tour and theyd be yo what class do you teach ?
i want to come learn from you .
you do not look a professor ive ever seen before .
and i would bring them into my classroom .
i wa shoulder in the machine and these kid that were once interested in automotive working on other people car wa wait i can use these machine to design my own engine to make my own car .
i could be henry ford one hundred percent you can .
and once we understand the full picture and they know hey yeah you you are into car yes you could work on them .
you could work on all the car that somebody else made learn that thing inside and out and be a journeyman mechanic on your own shop one day .
thats noble .
you can do that .
or if you into that and you love car and you are into these thing not on that side of it but the design or you want to know the design you want to know these thing .
you could come be the next elon musk over here .
you could be tesla and design a vehicle that you you want to make the next flying vehicle .
thats whats on this side of it .
and if people do not know that they do not know how to go there .
this is you own it man .
you own you on fire you on fire .
break this down man .
what the new american manufacturing renaissance tour ?
i see you traveling the country spreading the message .
talk to me about the opportunity that are available that you are exposing student to .
one hundred percent .
i get into between twelve and fifteen city on this tour .
it is a selfheadline pretty much selffunded .
i do have sponsor in the manufacturing industry .
we always looking for more .
we go into city for two day apiece .
the first day we spend a full day with job seeker and student where well either come to a technical college or a high school with a roble cte program .
and it is set up a a rap concert for real .
we got smoke machine a light show all type of stuff to get the kid aware of and excited about career in advanced manufacturing .
i talk about my story all the dope thing that ive worked on .
the second day i bring industry and city leader out .
and at that mixer we do a recruiting and retention workshop .
you could say hey this is why it is important to not only showcase these 21st century career in your area but this is how you reach back to them and build a bridge from where you are now .
that mean internship apprenticeship volunteering robotics team or something that .
we start to build those bridge in these city that the ecosystem becomes selfsustained where academia can support community .
and then the city leader can support legislation that support both .
and then now weve got not only innovation but high paying job in these city core where they werent once a prevalent a they were .
give me give me a success story from one of the the tour where you saw a student mind blown or you saw some folk getting give job or something give me something .
one hundred percent .
most of the time we do in both of those thing ?
we want to bring the trade to the people face .
when you come to my tour you are going to walk into most likely an auditorium you are going to walk into dope music a light show .
i said kid screaming getting handout all type of stuff .
it is a high energy show .
outside of the auditorium you are going to have local business and technical college with admission counselor and people that are given apprenticeship there on the spot which is our technical college .
wsu tech which is called state university technical .
we were able to increase their enrollment in their summer cte program by two hundred percent .
we got thirty kid signed up for their dual enrollment program from west high school into the wsu tech program .
and a lot of time every city that we go to there always some type of scholarship or award given that that bridge is real .
and thats the thing that i think our community were missing .
people were coming into the community and saying hey you can do this you can be this they werent showing them how they werent showing them the tool needed to get there .
and then they werent empowering them to be able to do it .
thats the reason why i do not go to the community member and do the first show .
thats good .
we want to turn on the light bulb and get that mind thinking .
but then we want them to be able to connect and know exactly where to go. . thats wichita in in detroit .
and there another person that wa on my panel that doe 3d printing with all type of exotic material .
and they continue to probe the kid how would this help your community ?
what if you had this is a product you would need a sale department and this this and this .
that mean you could hire twenty five people from your community if this wa a product .
and at the end of that conversation they were invited to come into the lab they can do rd and begin to make these thing from what these kid idea was. . thats what we want to push .
thats what we want to promote .
you mentioned 3d printing .
i know there a big skill gap .
talk to me a little bit more about for our educator who may be listening what are some of the skill they should be focusing on a it relates to advanced manufacturing opportunity .
now there is a two.one million open job opportunity in advanced manufacturing .
and thats everything that fall under that .
we think about the making of anything tangible that we have .
our computer the chair that we are sitting in the glass that we are both wearing .
manufacturing touch every single thing. . thats number one .
number two manufacturing now we have a new industrial revolution thats amongst u now .
the fourth industrial revolution is when the machine that are making thing are combined with the supercomputer .
the ai the automation the cloud the robotics and stuff that. . there is a big shift in what job are going to look going forward due to ai due to robotics due to automation .
and now we want to set kid up to be the people that are pushing the 21st century career forward or even to have them be working we need to start pushing thing problem solving .
and you got to figure that out. . being able to solve problem on the fly under pressure under stress within a team is something else that we need to do .
but some of these machine that we have before thirty printing are fiftyzero one hundredzero in every high school can afford those type of machine .
and then an instructor that know how to program these machine and teach the curriculum at the same time .
what we have now is weve got the digital era where a lot of those machine are digital to where you can have the machine and manipulate it on a laptop. . you do not necessarily have to have the machine in your program .
you do not have to have the expendables .
there opportunity online .
you can teach the same skill and kid can get that same knowledge and start building thing themselves and trying thing out .
or again i said a 3d printer fifty to one hundred .
you do not even have to have a curriculum .
there plenty of them that are free online .
there a lot of place that will help you build one for your school .
but if those thing do not even we are in the era now we are having one in your classroom and giving the kid access to it .
theyll gravitate to the 3d printer .
you two university theyll figure it out themselves .
and the one that want to put their foot on the pedal youll see them start making thing and connecting thing and doing it themselves .
and then thats the kid that you will power and say we need to put him in a robotics league program or we need to maybe help him start one in our school or whatever that look .
and i noticed that i know exposure and getting this message out is super important to you .
and i appreciate we talked a little a little about the jane adam resource corp or jart .
talk to me about the expansion that you all have rolling out .
jane adam resource corporation is corporation that started in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five before i wa born .
and theyve been doing a lot of the work to help people get pathway out of poverty by having good job .
and since then and even till now manufacturing career are one of the job you can get with the quickest amount of training it ha the highest starting pay and the career ladder is almost never ending .
there much that you can do with it .
theyve identified career in manufacturing cnc programming automation machining and welding a these career that offer the upward mobility .
we have four training center in chicago one in baltimore that we launched five year ago and then one in the woman prison in rhode island .
the machine is the nuclear engineer the nondestructing testing engineer we are able to take people from the community skill them up and then get them into accelerated program to be able to start filling those good job in detroit .
we are doing the same thing .
we are able to get into detroit and we are going to be launching the training there .
we are going to be focused more on mobility .
we are looking at anything thats moving .
if we are moving heart people product anything that detroit is trying to be the epicenter of the globe of everything that ha anything to do with mobile and mobility .
electric vehicle electric vehicle charging station everything that .
we are going to gear up and get the community ready to get skilled up and take those job a a they come .
hey man listen you you have your finger on the post man .
i think it is going to be a great episode when i saw you posting about the fact that it wa manufactured .
i said we have to do this .
i am also here .
some some phenomenal thing are happening in the state of illinois .
there a lot of there a lot of new energy around manufacturing and making here domestically in the united state .
whether thats the build back better plan whether thats the good job act whether thats a lot of reshoring effort to get a lot of the work that we exported to the china of the world and the career of the world back over here .
the government understands that weve got to make thing in america to be able to make it period and to bring our city back and to bring people back to a good middle class strong middle class .
some of the dope maker that are making thing that i can not say now .
but there are some product that are going to be released and they are there in illinois and they are from people that look you and me .
they had an idea and now these thing are real and their business .
and we want to tell a story .
people that are not in illinois but they are looking for a chance to make it themselves can come here .
if there company in illinois that say hey we want to connect with people to help them make it theyll connect .
we want to strengthen that ecosystem put maker on the bigger platform and get into the nitty gritty of what this manufacturing industry is about .
thank you for sharing that .
and i know it wa something that wa on my mind .
i think it is a matter of national security .
and i am on man .
one hundred percent .
when you think about the chip it is a need them for everything but we are not .
it is it is .
and the biggest question is if we not making them who is . . and in our phone on the computer that we are now in our car if these chip are made by an adversary they got the power to press a button and everything go crazy ?
definitely need to be making thing here .
the submarine industrial base and myself connected because the day after russia invaded ukraine i wa at the white house speaking with the president the joint chief of staff simultaneously the pentagon about our industrial base .
if we get pulled into a war effort now with the amount of thing that we are given to other country can we supplement ourselves to make more thing to protect ourselves and our industrial base is not big enough to support a war effort now ?
also if we had to go to war and we were pulled into war now we would have to purchase our jet fighter our tank our submarine from again another country that is capable of making them .
theyve got the drop on what we are making and what we have and all of those different thing .
it is imperative that we are making here and we are not making here but we are innovating a . and we are the forefront of that innovation .
anything else you can share from from that conversation at the white house any other outcome ?
what thought ?
if if if you look at build subarrange.com if you watch college football or the world series now nascar they are doing a big campaign to get submarine built .
the department of defense ha ordered three subarranges per year for the next eight year i want to say and thats going to take one hundredzero people to be one hundredzero more people to be able to do every year .
we are talking job that are starting at thirty an hour up to begin to start building these these submarine .
and a lot of time people think about our national security a u going somewhere fighting a war but a lot of the war do not happen because of the defense and the thing that we have .
a lot of people will not test u because they know what we are capable of and the thing that we make and the fact that we can turn them out and make them very very fast .
thats a strategic advantage of ours. . and with the conflict that have been going on and the people that weve been supporting we are pretty thin now. . we are not in a place that we are going to lose anything anytime soon .
however we need to be in a place where people do not want to think about testing u what i am saying ?
and now weve got thirty one nuclear warhead spread out around the world that belong to the united states. . and these are on submarine .
the reason they are on submarine is because a submarine ha a nuclear reactor inside of there it doesnt need gas .
it doesnt need any of those thing .
it can go perpetually forever. . another thing is nobody know where these thirty one warhead are .
not u not anybody in the united state navy or the department of defense .
what happens is they tell these submarine captain here a stretch of ocean .
it is yours .
get out there and they can be anywhere within that thing. . if any conflict happens at any time we could have a defense response .
they call it the second wave at a snap of a finger .
it is those capability that keep people from having a first wave of anything because they know what our second wave is going to be .
and most of those warhead that are on these submarine the submarine are fifty year old or older. . that doesnt mean the technology is bad because the government is usually forty year ahead of u in technology but we need to have a concept fleet .
this protection .
thats one of the big thing that we are working on now is making that happen .
it wa a different thing that meant different to people. . now there a different rhetoric on war and it definitely should be. . and we see kid that are protesting all the time and it is beautiful that they are protesting .
i do not think personally it is going to come from those protest .
i think there is going to be some change there and there value there .
but at the same time we need people with that mindset working for these companies. . and ill tell you why .
if you come from that mindset that war is not necessary .
we shouldnt have war and then you go work for a boeing or raytheon or something that and you are in the design department then you can change how war fall .
hey we are making drone that ha to ever go on the front line .
this is a war between drone .
this is a war between humanoid robot or whatever that look . . thats how you begin to change the narrative .
people did not the way that automobile were .
now we have electric vehicles. . people did not the way that electric vehicle were driving or people were driving .
weve covered a lot here man .
youve covered a lot .
it is a lot .
this is an episode we have to go back and watch a couple of time .
i wa going to say this might be a twoparter .
my last question for you all of my guest is whats your vision for the future career tech education ?
i want to see more manufacturing facing career in school sooner .
whether that mean getting 3d printer in kid hand in first and second grade getting kid playing more thing minecraft where they are in a 3d environment they are having resource allocation and then building from there and understanding the process of building different thing .
whether that mean more field trip to manufacturing aligned place .
and the earlier we can start that the more we can engage them when they are young the better off well be .
and thats thats something easy and tangible for anyone listening is even rethinking the field trip experience taking student to see place where advanced manufacturing are happening and getting that early career exposure .
starting earlier at the elementary level exposing them to these opportunity .
thats thats powerful man .
if anyone who listening want to connect with you they want to bring the tour .
they want to book one of these phenomenal keynote .
where do you want to direct ?
you all can find me at drewcrowmfg.com on the website .
you can do all of the thing that you mentioned .
you can book me for the tour .

and then you can also get my free workbook .
this book is going to outline all of the thing that you need to do to get going .
all the freeway are the way that you can get those thing started now and start attracting the youth .
and then on the other end i got a book for job seeker in high school and middle school student if they want to start exploring these career they want to figure out what is a career manufacturer and what are some of the high one ?
how do i get into manufacturing ?
what a pathway look .
what i need to start studying now to be successful .

miss abkins changed my life and is one of my dearest mentor and she will be deeply missed .
last year when i went to start teacher at my school in the district the last phone call i got on my home phone before i disconnected it wa from mrs. akins .
this wa after she had already retired and this is what she said to me .
ill try to say it without tearing up .
vicky saw in the newspaper that your star teacher for the district i always knew you were a star and i am proud of you .

this is episode one hundred and ninety one of the ten minute teacher podcast .
miss grace atkins wa my fourth grade teacher and an inspiration to me .
shes been teaching for fifty six year .
she is our learning lab director here at westwood school and i can tell you in my life shes probably the most amazing person that i know .
she inspires me every day .
i want to be her when i grow up and she is an incredible person .
miss atkins youve taught for fifty six year .
you taught for quite some time and you are not even slowing down yet .
you do not look it all and you are getting close to that 90th birthday there .
what keep you in education ?
it is always another child to help and you do not give up on child .
now you have some amazing kid that people have given up on .
tell u some of the thing that your student who struggle with learning difference are now doing .
she wrote everything back which had adhd and we had an educational prescription that we failed and his parent failed at home and he did not give up his family did not give up and we did not .
there he is .
of course i have many others to jump on .
you wonder if they are going to make it but you keep on working with them every day and they make it .
yeah my two of my child have learning difference and you always helped me coach whats your secret for not giving up ?
that give me a reason to get up every morning .
i get up at the real clock .
my exercise by ten mile .
me whatever come .
let talk about that routine because you have some family member that have ended up on the radio in atlanta because nobody can believe you are routine .
tell u your routine of what you do in a typical day .
i showed you part of what i do but i get up and i am riding a bike ten mile in the morning and then i have my morning devotion and i am to god post .
evosho below .
that mr. wood funded .
i did not know he did that .
i do not have to stand and then i have one other bobo study that i do every morning and then i write down quote that i want to go through .
they say we are never long we always have somebody with u . itll open by now .
now you read more than anybody i know .
and i read .
i have forty book a year .
what i read ?
i am not reading .
i am not a book .
we love pat williams .
missackins and i talk book all the time .
now we want the listener to know a little bit about who this amazing mr. woodruff is that missackins is talking about .
would you tell u what your husband did and a little bit about mr. woodruff because he instrumental in u even having a learning lab here at westwood ?
now harusman and i move to the plantation and we were twenty seven year old and we are talking about it to a plantation in baker county .
mr. harder it would be a hit wa for the greatest man i ever knew and he will make a help .
everybody and make a difference .
which that went on to become the cdc and of course mr. woodruff is he climbed to find my guess wa a head of cocacola and i have to say that my husband kept also work at the jones ecological center which is on h.o.i .
plantation nail we do have quite a love of that .
it is no way in what he done .
let go back to learning difference on some people call them disability but i feel everybody learns differently you are one of the pioneer in reaching kid with learning disability tell u how what you did .
the first year i told wa one thousand nine hundred and forty six and it wa my nation from then on to find out why bright child did not always do in school .
i knew they were bright and through one thousand nine hundred and forty six that wa my mission to find out and it took me thirty year because i wa in the reading department and your answer is an odd in reading .
she became a technology leader not because she loved technology but because she loved child and knew we needed to harness technology to teach child the best .
if you look at her result through the year you will see that mrs. howard is an exceptional teacher .
now she is telling it it is from her experience and i fully know that some of the thing she say might be different from what you hear from popular motivational educational speaker thing all of kindergarten should be playtime .
however if you hear the testimony of the parent and the student who took mrs. howard class youll hear that they are spectator loved her class cried when they couldnt come to school and that student were transformed at home into happier healthier more helpful child .
i hope youll listen to what she say because how she talk to u on this podcast is also how she would talk to her student with respect simplicity and using word in meaningful way .
now miss howard and our friend and she make me call her sharon but i still look up to her and often talk to her about teaching when i see her at church .
now well talk to mrs. sharon howard with an excerpt from episode seven hundred and forty eight of the tenminute teacher podcast .
today we have a pleasure to interview one of my hero miss sharon howard .
she is a k5 teacher kindergarten teacher here at my school and she is retiring after forty four year of working with the student now in may of two thousand and twenty one .
shes finished up one whole year in all of his pandemic of facetoface instruction .
i do not think ill miss today .
they did not miss one day every single day with her kindergarten facetoface she is a remarkable woman and miss howard you are retiring .
how doe that feel to think about because teaching ha been such a part of your life hasnt it ?
yes yes definitely .
thats been my main goal is to maintain my family the best that i could .
my husband wa very supportive most of the time he wa up here after he retired to help me with bulletin board and all of my book collection because thats what ive done for forty four year is collect childrens book .
retired discussion something wa very interesting that wa said .
a person who had a child who wa a behavior problem before he came to you said his wife at parent teacher night before school start that down with you and said what are you going to do when my child miss behaves ?
what wa your answer in why ?
and wa the star student that i had no problem with with him .
your plan wa not having a discipline problem .
thats true .
now all child are different .
they come to you with all different personality .
they are some who to take charge but that wa part of my strategy is setting up where i stood in the class and what i expected of them .
and yes if there were time where somebody wa trying my patient to see how far i would go i gave them three strike and you are out .
if i had to speak to them three different time for the same offense then that meant three time and you will give me some of your play time. . did that doe that happen very much ?
it did not happen any this year ?
none of the more it is not even once .
i think my first year wa howard .
i always told my parent that if i have a school issue at school i to try to handle it between me and the student first .
when it get to the point that the child is not willing to work with me thats when i give them the option .
you can either work with me or we will give mom and dad a call and we will involve them .
i tried to give them choice ?
that wa the way that i taught them to grow and mature and start making good choice that pertain to themselves .
youve got your discipline plan is not a have a problem which is awesome .
what advice do you wish that you had known in the earlier year of your teaching ?
i think the idea of expecting high standard and high ideal for my child it is a transition from a k4 class to a k5 class .
there a big difference in that child and they are coming out of that playtime syndrome and they are coming into what i call real school because not many student in k5 learn to read to write learn to their number .

jason jason if you want the only jason .
why is it that we all want something ?
we have goal we have thing that we believe are important but we struggle to focus on them .
yeah there a couple of different thing .
i think the first thing is that we hold our subback from a we have a lot of fear .
and fear when you start to dive into them you mentioned in the beginning of this i started talking to you about the east and i remember you told me in two thousand and seventeen you should read the bhagavad gita .
i wrote it by god the next week and read it while we were traveling .
and there wa that .
and a i wa writing the book i wa whats the thing ?
because you are talking about the book wa a psychology of taking action .
because i wa looking at the mindset mentor podcast .
i had onefour hundred episode and i wa it is me speaking for almost every single one of them .
and i wa what do i teach ?
what do people want for me ?
and i wa it is almost all tip and trick to understand yourself to take action .
because everybody who listening to a podcast ha the awareness of i want to improve i want to get better .
i want something different but how do i do it ?
and i started saying if taking action is what the book going to be about why do not people take action in the first place ?
and one of the thing that pop up for people is fear .
they are there some fear that pop up for them .
and i had a conversation with one of my friend who went and lived in the tribe with a tribe a native brazilian tribe in the middle of brazil .
and he had to fly into a town .
he had to hop on a boat and go for two day on a boat in the middle of nowhere .
and he started talking to me about these thing that he called primal fear and intellectual fear .
a primal fear is is pain or death is attached to it .
and we do not come up with too many primal fear in our life not is .
intellectual fear is what we deal with all day long which is the fear of rejection the fear of failure the fear of not being accepted the fear of success .
we all of these fear and all of these fear are made up in our mind .
and i wa listening to i am pretty sure it wa sad guru i wa listening to .
and i wa i put on and i wa driving around in sedona a i wa writing the book a they are to try to get my whole mind together by myself writing it .
and i wa look at it fear and trying to figure them out .
and one thing that he said that hit me more than anything else is ive identified my fear and the next thing is how do i overcome these fear ?
and if it is an intellectual fear the fear that exist in our mind is you can not overcome something that doesnt exist .
and we create we wake up in the morning we create the book you man which is the fear of success the fear of failure whatever it is .
and instead of taking the action that we need to and focusing on what it is that we want we take all of our focus and put it towards trying to overcome this fear .
when in reality the fear doesnt even exist in the first place .
and i think the biggest thing for most people is the fear is keeping you from focusing .
but there also the identity of who you think you are .
and one of my favorite thing is challenging who i think i am all the time .
i love the story and i put in the book of jim carrey when he decided to be in man on the moon .
then the man on the moon a movie where he ended up playing andy kaufman .
and there wa a whole documentary that wa done on this and they curved it for twenty year because it wa off the rail .
of how crazy he went .
and what he did wa he it is a documentary called jim and andy thats on him playing the role on man on the moon .
andy kaufman wa a guy who wa once alive .
and the crazy part about andy kaufman is he also played other character .
a jim carrey playing andy kaufman who played tony clifton and other character .
but the thing that happened with him wa that he would never break character .
he wa a method actor .
for four month he played a this real life person .
not jim carrey anymore .
and what happened wa he ended up and it get crazy where he end up doing therapy session with andy kaufman real daughter and his family .
help them overcome his sudden death .
and what happens is they stop recording four month later and he i do not know who i am .
and he lost to me wa .
and he i do not know my belief .
i do not know what make me happy .
what make me sad ?
what piss me off anymore ?
he ive lost to jim carrey is .
and thats his spiritual awakening that youve seen him go through over the past twenty year .
and he realized if i can lose jim carrey then who the hell is jim carrey ?
and he realized that jim carrey is a character that he playing all the time that is completely somebody else .
and he could wake up another morning and act he somebody else .
and i think that two of the thing that keep u from focusing on stuff is we get afraid and fearful of making change or judgment or failure and all that .
and the other thing is who we truly think we are .
well hold u back from taking either the action that we need to or staying in the exact same position that we are in .
i want to go down both of those route because i find them both fascinating for different reason .
and i want to go down that more spiritual ethereal journey a . because yeah but before we do that i want to make sure that .
if we talk about the fear that people are experiencing a you said a lot of the time it is an intellectual fear .
it is not real but it feel real .
those feel extremely real .
how do you process a feeling that feel real even though it may be intellectual ?
thats the beautiful thing about being a human .
and i think it is and you can correct me if i am wrong but i think it is in the bag of our gigi .
it give an example of a line attacking you at a tiger attacking you at night .
and one of the example i give in the book is it is similar to that where it is if you think about it if you weve all had this .
we have a intense dream .
you are walking in a forest whatever it is and a lion it start running after you .
you you you run from it you turn you look over your shoulder get close or you are still running from it you turn you look over your shoulder a teeth are about to dig into you .
and you wake up in the middle of the night and your body did not move at all .
but you are sweating you are out of breath your heart rate is intensely going .
and the amazing thing about being a human they usually say in any case is what your biggest strength is is also can be your biggest fault .
the thing about human is that we can project our mind into a future that doesnt exist yet .
and what we can do now is we can sit here we are in this studio everything is amazing .
we have food water shelter clothing everything .
but if i am a a lot of people do if i am starting a business i can sit here and i can think why do i want to start this business ?
but then i start playing out all of the thing that could go wrong which is what we tend to do .
not what go but what could go wrong .
when i project my mind into that future the crazy part is that my mind and my body are constantly connected .
my my brain is sending neuropeptides to my body and creating hormone a if that moment is happening now .
and what happens is we tend to a human a a protection mechanism we tend to project ourselves into a future that is fearful that is scary and that fearful scary feeling usually keep u in the exact same place .
and what i always say is if i am going to imagine the worst that could happen why do not i at least try to see the best that could happen ?
and if i am going to notice myself the awareness of i am in a lot of fear now with starting this business .
and i am going man whats the worst that could happen ?
then i am a close my eye and say whats the best that could happen ?
and what would it feel to start this business and to be able to crack a million dollar in a business ?
and how proud of myself would i be to break a million dollar in sale and to be able to build this and travel with my family and provide what ive always wanted to provide .
and if i am going to feel the feeling of fear why do not i also try on feeling the feeling of success in getting there ?
and if we notice it is an intellectual fear the first the first piece that i always say is there three piece there the awareness of it .
i am aware that i am in a state of fear .
i need to practice to get myself out of that .
if i notice myself in a state of fear whats my practice to get myself out of it ?
i am going to go ahead and i am going to calm down and take sixty breath and i am going to connect back to my heart and i am going to ask myself whats the best thing that could happen ?
thats the practice to get myself out of it .
and then the last piece is repetition .
it is awareness it is practice it is repetition .
if i do it over and over and over again eventually i start to rewire myself .
one of the thing that i found in myself year ago that i did not wa wa that i judge people .
and i am man i love people .
i love i try to do i try to be a surface a much a i can but an immediate thought that will come in my head sometimes is judgment of somebody that i do not know .
and i judge them .
and i wa i do not that pattern .
i want to change this pattern within myself .
i become aware of what i want to change .
and the first time i did it i wa at a grocery store and this guy had this bluetooth the long bluetooth .
i wa in a if he wa making cold call at an office but he wa at the grocery store .
and immediately the first thought of my head wa judgment .
and i always say you can not change your first thought but you could change your second thought .
i noticed the judgment a a first thought .
my practice that i decided for myself wa i am going to force myself in my head to say three thing that i about this guy .
i paused myself in the moment .
i found myself in a pattern that i do not want to be in anymore .
what are three thing that i about this guy ?
and then i went on about my day .
and i started doing this over and over and over and over again .
and one thing that i noticed is that my first thought started changing to le judgment and more acceptance .
because ultimately thats what i want to work on is more acceptance in loving of people and of myself .
and i think it is it is becoming aware of it .
once you are aware of the thing that you are trying the patio trying to change whats the practice that you are going to take yourself down .
and then noticing that you are going to need to do it over and over and over and over again .
but one of the biggest key is to give you yourself grace a you are doing it .
because a lot of time we make we are not become aware .
and then we judge ourselves and we beat ourselves out for it .
i think it is giving yourself a lot of loving grace and going hey ive noticed this pattern .
do not worry .
we are going to change it .
let go on this practice and continuing to do that .
said i think often we get scared even of having the thought of what could be possible because we are scared that it can not be possible .
and we find another thing to be fearful of .
and i love this idea of what you are saying around transforming your thought .
because ive definitely the more and more ive studied book the more and more ive read and ive thought ive discovered that all of our failure and success in life is based on our most repeated thought .
and one of my biggest question to most people i meet now is what is your most repeated thought ?
and most people do not know the answer because they are not aware in your word .
and a lot of people who do know will say it is something i am not good enough .
i do not the way i look .
i am whatever else it may be for them. ?
and we are either aware and it is negative or we are unaware because it is subconscious .
and ive started to recognize that most of the thought we have are not that different .
they are the same thought that come in a different voice a different tone a different vocabulary a different language but it is the same repetition .
and ive started to think about whats my most repeated thought ?
and how can i be more a you are saying how can i be more selective about it ?
and how can i choose it more effectively rather than let it be something thats coming up ?
and it is not do not identify with your thought .
one of the thing that i do not remember where i heard it before but the way i to think about it and ive heard you say before even a lot of people say i struggle with meditating .
and ive heard you say before where it is not about mastering your thought .
it is not about making your thought going away .
it is becoming aware of your thought a little bit more .
because when we close our eye about sixty of our brain is visual .
for visual thing to see .
when close our eye it turn off a lot of part .
and thought usually come up and we become aware of those .
one thing that ive been doing a lot recently is trying to be in a much silence a possible .
i am trying to be a much silence a i possibly can .
because i feel thats where a lot of my awareness is a lot of my answer come from .
and when you sit there and the analogy that i love when you start thinking of your thought is it is sitting on the edge of a mountain and down below there a road going that you are looking at .
and sitting on the edge of the mountain is meditating or sitting in silence .
and looking at your thought .
and you can watch the car go by the thought that go by and not have to be attached to them .
you do not find yourself getting sucked into the red car that went by .
you watch the car go by .
and thats the way that i try to to see my thought which is i am going to watch them go by .
i am not going to connect to them .
but i can look at them and be is this thought which about ninety of our thought the same a yesterday is this thought helping me in trying to get to where i want to be in life ?
or is this thought holding me back from trying to get to where i want to be in life ?
and if it is helping me then i want to strengthen it .
if it is not helping me then hey a i am a podcast that i can not get from my first thought about i can throw my second .
what would i prefer my second thought to be ?
yeah i think you hit the nail on the head .
thats what it is for me .
it is whether youve understood that you are not your thought or not .
that can be quite hard for people because i think we are close to them .
but even if you can practice distance through meditation or mindfulness the real win is being able to look at a thought and say is it good for me ?
or is it not helpful ?
you said i think that is the wisdom of it .
that can i evaluate everything thats repetitive in my mind and ask myself is this useful ?
is it helpful ?
is it allowing me to move in the direction i want ?
because chance are a lot of what we are saying is doing the complete opposite .
and then you go wait a minute even though it is interesting .
and even though i could get lost in it i do not want to waste time .
and therefore ill move in the other direction .
you talk about procrastination in this book .
and that again going back to your earlier title is a block against the psychology of action .
and we all have a friend or maybe we are that friend that constantly put thing off .
we say ill do another year .
someone been saying that for two year .
there someone listening now who want to start an instagram page .
they are put it off for six month .
there someone listening who i missed out on the club house thing .
and then i missed out on the tiktok thing .
and now i am missing out on whatever the next thing is .
and we procrastinate hoping that one day will come .
what if you learned about procrastination through your research when you are writing the book that ha helped people break that cycle because it seems to apply to many of our life ?
the thing about it is this if ive always i always to be very extreme in example because we can go extreme that it make a lot of sense .
but i always tell people and i always say hey ive given this one i used to give a lot of speech .
i would be in front of people and say hey whats the chance of you making a million dollar this year ?
give me give me number and everyones zero percent zero percent .
one percent there always one percent .
and thats the most thatll get to .
and i said i am going to give you the most extreme example but i want to see what happens. ?
whats the percentage chance of you making a million dollar this year ?
legally and if you do not everyone that you love dy .
and everyones one hundred percent one hundred percent a thousand a thousand percent .
the golden and change the time frame did not change why you are doing it changed ?
would you wake up in the morning if everyone that you love life depended on it and be yeah maybe i should scroll on tiktok for a little while .
no youd be i am going to take action immediately .
and it doesnt need to be a fear of losing everybody but whats behind that is why ?
why they are doing it ?
if i ever reflection of anyone who doesnt know jay you are one of the hardest working people ive ever met but you have a strong vibe. ?
and thats one of the best part about it where it is when i see jay i am this guy ha he ha this internal feeling of i want to change the world .
and you work hard trying to do it .
and thats one of the most beautiful thing about you is you are wanting to change a world and you have a strong why to it .
and i think that if most people could figure out yeah i want to do this thing .
why do you want to do it ?
and my my very first one on one coach used to say to me he would say whats your why ?
whats your why ?
why are you doing this ?
why are you doing this ?
you are hammer it home in my head .
and i wa why do you ask this much ?
and he would always say because if you are why is strong enough you are how will reveal itself ?
if why you want to do something how it is going to be done youll figure out .
thing are going to get in your way .
there going to be obstacle .
there always going to be obstacle .
there always going to be challenge .
always going to be moment of i do not know if i can do this .
but if you are why is strong it is i do not care what come up in front of me .
most people they want to be motivated .
and i have come to to hate the word motivation because motivation is fleeting .
we can wake up and we can listen to a podcast where we can get read something and be motivated .
and then something can happen to u and it is gone which disappears .
what i want to be is i want to be driven .
when a driven person it in the rise yeah they are not stopping .
and the difference between a motivated person and driven person is that the driven person ha this why that they want to see have happened in the world or in their life or further family .
and i think if people are i want to accomplish this goal the very nice question is why .
and then go why why why why why why why why why i am going to deeper into it .
an example i given the book is i had a coaching client year ago eight nine year ago .
and he wa rob i want to make a hundred thousand dollar this year .
and i wa why ?
and i took him through whats called seven level of why keep asking why why why why why why why .
and and went from i want to make a hundred thousand dollar this year because ive never done it before to the eventual thing wa he had got into a divorce a couple of year ago .
both of his young child lived in a bad part of town with his ex wife .
he wanted to regain custody because he wa afraid that both of his child would be killed and a drive by .
and he wa terrified of it that that wa his actual true why .
and it wasnt the motivation i did not have talked to him say hey how close youd make a hundred thousand dollar this year i said hey how close youd provide him more safety for your child this year ?
because he wanted them to move in with him .
he wanted to be able to provide for them and to make sure that they were safe .
and i think that if we ask ourselves why do i truly want to accomplish this goal ?
it reveals itself and it make a lot easier to take the action .
yeah for sure .
i i appreciate all the word but i can definitely say the only thing thats kept me going is my wife because i think there are many thing that either make you want to give up or slow down or become lazy or complacent .
and when i look at it and someone asked me this i wa sitting with another creator end of last year and he wa to me jay why do you even do anything anymore ?
whats the point ?
why do you need to do anything ?
and i wa weve got to the start of it .
i got to the beginning of rereini to be .
i wa weve got to a point where we can connect with lot of people .
but we need to give people the stepbystep process to transform their life .
and now we can take them on the journey because people are listening they are engaged we have a community we have a connection with people but when i started out we did not have any of that .
i see a we got to the start of where i want to be because and it wa interesting to me that many people struggle to find their way .
and i think it is because we do not no one and you said your coach helped you do it .
it wa same with me my art teacher at from age eleven to age eighteen .
he wa my art teacher at school .
and every time id paint something or draw something or do a collage or graphic design .
and whatever i do the first question you asked me is why did you do it ?
and id be my initialist want to look good .
and hed be every year hed be why did you do it ?
and id be because this color match with this color .
and then we are why do you do it ?
and i am because it reveals the metaphor that i think this is about and then hed be why did you do it ?
and i am because thats how i am feeling now .
i am trying to and every year hed asked me he would reveal more and more layer of my psyche in a similar way .
and again ive owed it to someone in my life who pushed me to ask the question why same a you .
and i think what we are both saying is please ask that question to yourself .
but what if someone asks that question and they feel stuck ?
and they go ive asked it but it is want a nice house i want a nice car i want to it is not that deep .
and i think you are you said we do not have a lot of primal fear .
some people are listening now will have fear of survival .
and that is driving them .
and they all working hard and they are pushing .
and at the same time well have people who driven but they are i am not driven enough because i havent got anything to be that scared about what that worried about .
how do you that person discovered that way ?
yeah i think for me it is my life wa never terrible .
or when i when i started the yeah when i started the podcast the mindset meant to or i wa at a point in my life where i wa making a whole bunch of money .
and i wa twenty seven year old and i wa making two hundred and fifty grand a year and i wa working from home and everything wa great .
but i felt i wa slowly withering away .
and i could see what the future wa going to be while i wa there .
and i said if i do this for another five year .
and i am thirty two year old i am still doing this .
is that going to fulfill me ?
and it gave me more anxiety to think about having my manager job .
and then i sat there and i thought i want to do this podcast thing .
it seems to be going pretty .
i want to coach people .
i want to help people .
and i also at the same time wa starting an amazon business and trying to make money online and do that .
and i thought about it .
and i asked myself if i fast forward five year from today do i want to be the person to sale management ?
i am doing now and consulting .
do i want to be the guy thats selling stuff on amazon and incredible amazon business person ?
or do i want to be the guy thats coaching people and helping people change your life ?
and the immediate answer wa very clear coaching people and changing their life .
and i wa that feel it is the path .
and then immediately come up is all kind of fear .
because i do not know what i am doing .
back in the day two thousand and fifteen nobody made any money and podcast .
i did not have any idea of how to grow a business any of that type of stuff .
but what wa important to me wa number one when i fast forwarded into the future .
the future that i did not want seemed way more painful than trying the unknown .
and what could be if i did take the path ?
and that wa that became more of a fear .
the fear of judgment the fear of putting myself out there the people opinion it wa there .
it is still there .
and i do not know if you ever get past it but shes getting more used to it .
but the fear of being in the exact same position working the same job made making a little bit more money doing this for every day .
and the day i died wa terrifying .
that wa that wa a fear .
and i wa then this path of the unknown is not a scary .
and i might a take this path of the unknown .
and ill be fully transparent .
there wa i shared this on one other time i think .
there wa a moment in two thousand and fifteen where i started the podcast in august of two thousand and fifteen .
november of two thousand and fifteen i wa feeling a whole lot of fear .
and i wa i might have to go back and work for someone else again .
and it wa fear wa in my head .
i got a new house .
i do not know how i am going to do this .
i am not making any money doing this .
my sister came out to me .
and i believe if you are silent the message is always there .
if you are looking the message is always there .
my sister ha at her house .
and she go hey have you ever seen this box of dad stuff ?
and i wa no and she brought it .
my father wa an alcoholic .
he passed away and i wa fifteen from his alcoholism .
and she brought out this box .
and it wa his glass .
he wa a t shirt of his .
and the other thing were a bunch of letter .
my dad wa in jail for a little while for multiple duis .
and they put him in jail .
and he would write letter to u . and he wrote a letter to my sister on a 19th birthday .
and i wa reading this two thousand and fifteen .
he had a wrote it to in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine .
and the very last line wa i hope you live your life with courage love and laughter .
and i read it and it wa the universe warped .
and i wa he wrote this for me .
there wa a moment where i wa he wrote this to my sister .
but the universe is giving this message through my dad because i need to hear this now .
because i am in much fear .
and the very first line is courage .
live your life with courage love and laughter .
and i wa i got to commit .
i i this ha to be the thing .
ive got to make a decision .
and when you look at the root word of decision it is decaderaary which mean to cut off .
i am going to cut off all other option .
i had her will smith say there no reason to have a plan because it is a distraction from playing a it is got to be the thing .
and i wa my god i got to commit to this thing .
i can not have any more feeling of i am going to go back to work for someone else .
this is my life path .
they are going to succeed at it .
and i wa i do not know what to do .
i wa i am going to get this tattoo to my arm .
i have get live your life with courage love and laughter .
tattoo to my my very first tattoo i ever got .
but it wa for me people always think when you make a decision the fear disappears i wish that i could do these thing .
but it is it is always there .
but youve got to learn that the fear is always going to be there .
but my bigger fear is getting to end in my life and having not done this having not tried to help people .
being in the room with with my father after he passed away when i wa fifteen year old and realizing because he wa a first person .
i ever met the past away .
i am going to be there one day .
i wa yeah thats i am going to he he wa a dreamer and he wa an amazing person .
but he did not do what he wanted to do .
i am not going to live that life .
i am going to create what i want to create .
and now i have all of the other fear that everyone else ha but my biggest fear is getting to end in my life and not having tried or not having at least gone for it .
yeah thats i love hearing that .
and youve reminded me of a great speech that jim carrier gave fun of the enough .
and he talked about how he died .
and i could begin this wrong .
but he said that his dad wa an accountant and he did that to be safe .
and he said that when he wa young his dad got made redundant from his safe job. . jim carrier said that in life you are probably going to fail at something you do not love .
you might a try something you do love. . this idea that i am choosing the safe option or i am choosing some of my parent thought my family wanted or i am choosing something .
i think is secure even thats unstable and uncertain .
and the uncertainty that you pursue is le fearful .
because you are on top of it .
because it is perfect .
and my id say my best habit in life is recognizing that that is the biggest myth that weve been sold .
and i do not accept it .
and i am that my life requires constant work ethic and effort and awareness and being a student and being conscious because that is whats being demanded by this world a uncertain world force you to be conscious .
but if you are unconscious in an uncertain world thats leading to a dangerous place .
and but i think we are waiting for that moment where we can not be conscious because it is much hard work .
but to your point it is way harder work being unconscious .
because the amount of unconscious issue that arise are numerous .
i think there a lot of wisdom in what you said because a lot of people would rather be let me get to this destination once and everything becomes better .
hey i want that too .
i do too. . and i thought that for a long time .
and it is interesting the journey that ive had is i always wanted to make money because i thought money wa going to give me what i needed .
it would give me that safety and security that i never felt a a child .
and then i got to a goal that i wanted to get to .
and i realized i feel exactly the same a ive always felt .
i do not feel any more loved .
and what i realized is what i wa searching for from the external world is what i wa searching for for myself .
and i am trying to be there a the thirty eight year old man for the nine year old boy thats still healing .
and what ive realized is that none of the material thing anything externally will ever give me what i wa ever searching for .
everything ive always searched for in the external wa what ive been searching for for myself .
and i do not one hundred agree with you .
i do not think there any destination we ever get to .
i think i am constantly going to overcome more thing every single day .
and if i live to one hundred i would be lucky and another sixty two more year i do not expect that i am going to get to the end of my life and be i figured it out .
yeah absolutely .
i heard this you remind me of this story thats told about benjamin franklin and benjamin franklin had thirteen virtue and these were quality that he aspire to develop in his life simplicity or authenticity patience thing that .
and when he wa on his deathbed they asked him which one he did not accomplish and he said it wa the 13th one and they said what wa that ?
and he said humility .
and i loved that because i think what you are saying is humility doesnt mean your meek or weak .
it mean i am able to accept there always more to learn .
i do not know everything and it is .
i am going to give myself grace for it too .
it is not a feeling of i am useless because i do not know .
it is ill become more useful if i recognize there are thing that i still have to learn .
and when i am listening to you about your spiritual journey and that silence i am intrigued by that walk u through how you filled that void almost practicewise because i identify with that fully and it is funny because we always talked about how our life will opposite .
because when i met you id gone down this deep spiritual path but i had no money .
and you and the other boat where you had sustained yourself financially and created a good stable place for yourself but you were seeking spiritually .
and we are at ?
we had that conversation .
and let talk about that too .
but i am intrigued a to how doe that couple of hour or whatever that time on your porch .
how do you do that for people ?
because i think we the sound of that but then we get distracted by the next thing .
what ive come to find and i can speak with them myself and what ive seen from other people .
but what ive seen with them myself is that ive learned a lot of lesson from my dad .
most of them after his death and me processing thing .
my father wa the way that he wa and he became an alcoholic because he had thing in his past that he hadnt worked through .
and the thing that he had in work through is when he wa twelve year old my father heard a gunshot .
he walked into the room and his dad had shot himself in the mouth at the shotgun .
and my dad grew up in rural tennessee .
this is 1960s when this happened .
1960s when this happened .
there wasnt a whole lot for him to understand it .
they werent podcasts .
they werent book to read we have nowadays .
and i always consciously knew that what wa happening wa that he had not healed his pain .
and gabber marta say do not ask why the trauma asked why the pain .
and when i first heard gabber marta i wa my god someone finally saying what i always thought with my father .
and we can look at him and say i he an alcoholic and he did not overcame a trauma .
the trauma that it came up in my life a i became a alcoholic .
and i did not sometimes we could see someone and say they drink too much alcohol .
they do too much drug .
they eat too much food .
and we can say yeah thats their addiction .
the problem in the hard thing in our society is that my addiction of workaholic is rewarded .
and people look up to it .
and they are you are doing great .
you are making much money .
all of this is good .
and what i came to find is that my workaholism wa me trying to not feel my feeling and to not work through and process those thing .
scrolling on social medium could be that way for somebody .
it could be some people are addicted to working out .
some people are addicted to watching tv .
and there many some people addicted shopping .
there many different addiction that we have .
and what i found is that the hardest thing for me wa to stop into not have to i wa always trying to fill every single moment of my day .
always try to be busy .
when i did not have something to do id find something to do on my business .
business you can always work all day every day .
and what ive tried to do and ive built in my business is a lot of system and process through my my vp of operation is helped me with this a ton .
to people take a lot of stuff off of my plate .
that i have more time to be .
it is my personal belief that i think that god the universe life whatever it is speaks in silence .
and if i want those message i need to be silent .
what i found for myself is when i would be silent a lot of anxiety would come up .
and if you got to go to the next thing you got to go to the next thing .
this is stupid .
you should be doing something else .
and then i realized that what i wa trying to do is achieve to fill a void .
but i could sit here and there been moment where ill sit on my porch and ill start cry .
and i am sometimes it is gratitude .
my god i can not believe ive been given this life .
i can not believe ive had these challenge .
i can not believe that ive had this come up with i am grateful for every single aspect of it .
and sometimes i sit there and tear up and i am i do not know what this is .
but this is something my body releasing .
and i need to be with this releasing process .
there interesting thing that people could look at .
there two video that are interesting on youtube .
one of them is called polar bear trauma where they show a video of polar there and they shoot away the tranquilizer gun from a helicopter .
the chase it down the helicopter heightened experience .
they shoot away the tranquilizer gun .
it is still awake .
but it is not completely out .
and it start having a convulsion .
start seasuring .
and eventually after it seasers it is what it is doing is it is releasing all of the cortisol all of the adrenaline from it body that there no trauma that come with it .
and then it go after it is shaken for a while .
take a deep breath and it calm down .
almost identical video of a impolite get attacked by a jaguar and the jaguar get scared off .
it start to convulse .
take a deep breath and then it move it .
and we are taught in our life at some point in time not to remove this and to work through these trauma and these feeling .
i think child naturally do it through temper tantrum .
they move it and sometimes a adult we either need to have an adult temper tantrum in safety where you take a pillow and you can be angry you can be mad you can scream you can cost you can smash it against the bed .
whatever it is in safety by yourself without other people around you do not scare them a . and then sometimes it is also sitting there in silence and realizing that what is coming is going .
it is when you squeeze an orange whats inside of it or it is juice because thats whats in it .
when you sit there and you put pressure on yourself or you give yourself space whats coming out is whats inside and your body natural intelligence is trying to let go of it .
and for me thats what i found is that there some moment where i am incredibly grateful .
there some moment where i am by doing nothing jay .
i get much anxiety and i am what is this ?
and instead of running from it i get curious .
and i think if we could get more curious ive been reading a whole lot of christian mercy recently .
i love christian mercy .
and one thing he say is do not know yourself because knowing is based in the past and past is based off of memory .
start learning yourself which is in the present moment .
be present and be what come up .
how can i be curious about this anxious feeling or these tear or whatever it is ?
and be being the space to know your self a little bit better .
yeah it is great .
talking about that that go to me back to what we were talking about .
the start of it .
you were saying how this idea of what if the worst thing happens what if the best thing happens .
then who are we ? .
come back to this know that i self is his learning and that i self what ha that spiritual journey taken you want to understanding identity .
god thats how it is deep a it can go .
that i am i am to solve that that chose this life .
and one of the thing that i to do is i to think that i chose this life .
and that immediately take me from being a victim in my life .
what wa me ?
my father wa this way .
he did this to me .
my mom did this to me .
and my teacher is acted this way .
versus me going i think my soul chose this life because this is whatever is needed for this path that it is on for whether it is reincarnation or whether it is heaven or hell or whatever there it come after this .
i do not know but i do know now i do have this life a rob dial .
and a i get older the thing i realize that my body change .
i am not a fast a i used to be .
i am a lot more sore than i used to be my body changing but my soul is this thing that is always there .
and the thing that ive that ive come to realize is that i want to i do not know if it is going to sound weird i want to unattach myself from this body from everything around me .
and i want to try to connect back to whats internally inside of me .
and the one thing that i find is that that never change that there a a truth thats behind that .
and truth is the thing that never change .
something change or if something could be questioned it is not true .
and but there this feeling that feel truth inside of me at least and everybody ha their own truth .
but for me my truth is there something thats behind all of it .
and the more that i connect to it the more peace that i have .
i listen to a lot of romdos .
and one of the thing that he said i wa listening to him on the drive over here and i listen to his meditation every day is the only work that you have to do is the connection to your own heart .
and i am always constantly thinking whats in the way of my own heart ?
what material possession what thing that i want to get or in the way of that ?
and the reason i think that it help is number one ive had much more peace from trying to connect to that .
and my relationship with my wife ha been much better because of it because i am not blocking her from letting her in .
shes experiencing me fully .
she start to be able to open up even more in different way .
id be able to experience her more fully .
and for me it is connecting to the thing thats behind it that feel the only thing thats truth .
now mind you if rob fifteen year ago had heard this youd be what the hell is that guy talking about ?
but on this journey ive realized that there something behind it all .
and i want to try to connect that something behind it all and see what it is .
and for me it is i to use myself a a guinea pig .
everything i teach in the mindset mentor and the podcast is all stuff that i am trying within myself .
and i use it a almost my own therapy session where i am talking to everybody but i am talking to myself .
i am reminding myself of all these thing .
and what i realize is i realized that after fifteen nineteen year of personal development it is personal element this this this this cup here .
and i feel my cup in person wa overflowing .
and then i found spiritual development .
and i realized my god it is a lot bigger cup .
and it is not even close to being full .
and it need it is my next thing that i am working on .
for me it is the mindset that working through i am constantly working on this and trying to get better .
but for me it is i want to connect to myself and see what else is in there .
yeah for sure .
thank you for sharing that .
you made me remember a c lewis statement that say you do not have a soul you are the soul and you have a body .
and i remember i used to have that written on a little person .
and i used to look at it every day fasting in the morning .
because i wa thinking about this concept of identity that the first thing ninety nine of u do when we wake up fasting in the morning is we look in the mirror .
usually we say something i look tired or do not that spot .
god whatever it is ?
now all of a sudden we are already in the bodily concept of life .
this bodily consciousness .
and now you live your whole day thinking about the body what is the body need the body need food et cetera .
and and thats natural .
thats not unnatural .
thats normal .
i do that too .
but then you are saying that at the same time youve got a nurture and nourished and connect with this deeper sense .
how do you balance the tune of real world where you have responsibility you have bill you have thing to do that are connected to the body .
but then at the same time we are you are not this body .
how do you make sense of these two seemingly opposite pursuit ?
i am the thing that i think i would have thought five or ten year ago wa that the more that i get into spiritual development the le motivated ill become of the most the le i will want to achieve .
that hasnt gone away in a way .
but what i have found is that i achieve through a place of of it is more i am not white not clean my way through life anymore .
i am not i can take action and not be wrapped up in my fear in my limiting belief .
and it is not i am in the world and in of the world at the same time where it is the soul is here and i get a i am speaking to everything that i say is also something that i struggle with every single day .
i am not master this process .
therell be time where i find myself in the world .
and i am stress there thing happening there this business where all of this weve got employee we are hiring people there stuff happening .
and then i take u to that back and i am it is it is a a game take a second .
thats it is all real .
it is i am not saying that it is not true .
it is not reality .
it is not in front of you .
it is all there .
but behind it all if i can connect to a deeper sense thats within me and the the soul that i feel is in there i am hey man chill out for a second .
it is not that big of a deal. ?
most thing there are there are definitely some thing that are big deal and people life and there death and there there thing that people have to be in control of them be able to pay bill and all that stuff .
all those are real and they are definitely necessary .
but behind it all you are still there .
and there this thing that if i can take myself back and out of my own heading into my heart which ha been a big journey for me because i wa i am analytical and wa never taught feeling and how to feel and process emotion .
but if i can take myself out of my head and into my heart what ive always found is that my head is always projecting itself into the future or sometimes projecting itself a the past .
but most for me if i sit on a meditative sometimes it is all of my todo list all of the thing that i have to do and it is projecting itself into the future .
my brain is always somewhere else .
my body it is always here .
and when i notice myself get stressed i notice myself get anxious i notice myself whatever feeling that might be feeling if i can take a couple of deep breath and get back into my body i am it is not that bad .
youll fit you you have overcome many thing in your life .
youll figure out a way to get through it .
and what ive found is that it is not that i do not take the action .
it is not that i am not wanting to achieve more and more thing and be able to have more fun and do all of this stuff in the external world .
but when i find myself take a step back and be in my heart is it make it a lot easier ?
i am not white knuggling and forcing my way through life .
it is almost i am allowing life to happen through me .
and i do not know how it work and i do not pretend to be smart enough .
but thing start happening around me that help me in the process of getting to whatever it is that i want to truly go .
yeah it is there this interesting thing in easter tradition .
there this obviously this idea of oneness and everythings one .
and then there this idea of duality that there this side and then there this side .
and one teaching that ive connected with is this idea of simultaneously one and different .
and it sound complex but it is not .
it is this idea that this feel real and it can be real and it is real and at the same time there is a greater reality .
rather than this feeling of everythings one everythings the same or it is disconnected there real and fake .
it is this idea that a lot of thing are real but then on the full picture .
the idea that today in la it is saying the weather rainy and cloudy .
but thats not the weather everywhere .
it is my current reality but it is not reality across the whole world .
and when you start looking in life in that way if there this reality and then there this bigger reality i think thats that zoom out .
thats that .
let me take a breath .
thats that .
i believe what i do is significant .
and at the same time it is insignificant .
we will not be remembered in a thousand year .
and it is .
and but we take it .
and if you only do one or the other if i only see my life a extremely significant everythings too high pressure .
my gosh i would it would hurt me .
and it would cause me pain if i thought everything i did wa of utmost significance .
and if i do my life wa insignificant if i do my life a irrelevant that would be bad for myself .
i still do anything .
i will not be able to function. . and i think it is interesting because the more and more i am learning i might have to learn how to hold these two seemingly opposite thing .
but they are connected in symbiotic and they are synchronous because they both have value going back to which thought ha value .
the collective thought of my life is significant and insignificant is the most helpful thought .
and because thinking i am significant and insignificant of both unhelpful thought .
you summarized perfectly what i feel ha been going through my head for year which is what i do i do believe is important .
and at the same time i am none of it matters. . it is this weird duality .
it is free .
but it is free because it take much pressure off where it becomes fun .
it is how can i bring more fun into life ?
when did we lose the joy of life and the fun of life that we had a child ?
when wa a program dot of u ?
and how can i connect to that child and bring that spirit back in and be yeah i am going to do some amazing thing in the world ?
but without it being stressful with with it being fun and with it being something that i can do and it effortlessly flow out of me .
i believe that every single person is incredibly creative .
and we are we are creator at the actual core of u and a lot of u have lost it .
and i lost it for year .
and what i think is how can i make the creativity flow out of me in some way ?
and allow the space for it to happen .
and one of the thing that happens and it is not necessarily my goal of it .
but when i sit in silence i get idea that come through and i am man i do not know how i did not see this .
and thats where they all are .
it is a lot of time we are trying to force thing to have .
we are trying to force creative or try to force idea .
but sometimes when i get there i am man yeah this is the thing ive been searching for .
and it is i think every person need to give themselves a little bit more space to not be on their phone to not be constantly and a lot of people have child there their child are up .
can you wake up a little bit earlier not be on your phone ?
and sit in silence and see what come up .
and i think that it is important for people because what youll notice is exactly what you are saying which is what we do this life is important .
but it is very insignificant .
and thats .
there nothing wrong with that .
ive i love watching video on youtube about how small the earth is compared to the rest of the universe .
and then it stress my wife out .
shes i am going to have a panic attack .
why why do you watch this ?
because i wa i to remind myself that even though it is all happening and i am in it none of it truly matter .
and thats .
and i think when i am listening to you there this feeling that i feel i agree with you .
i think everyone is a creator .
i do believe that creativity flow when we connect with that .
but i think sometimes we feel distracted from it .
and it is much easier to pull out of on it much easier to put on a show in the background .
it is much easier to do all of these .
it is much easier to do all those thing at the same time .
now we are no longer ever with one person .
we are with one person .
we are both on our phone .
and we are watching a show at the same time .
youve got three screen in front of you five screen in total .
and there this much distraction ?
we know that how doe a person possibly ?
and i say this out of compassion and empathy because it is it requires much from us. ?
because everything around u is built for distraction .
the food we are eating the thing we drink and consume the stuff thats created around u it is all to distract .
you are fighting almost what feel to a lot of people losing battle. ?
what do you do to get pick yourself back up ?
whats more whats more important than that ?
whats more important than connecting to your true self to working on yourself ?
why do i why am i hardcore in mindset ?
because i know how many people are wrapped up in their mindset and their thought and their belief and their pattern that they are stuck in .
and what ultimately we all want i think is freedom .
and the way to get through to that freedom is to work on yourself .
whatever that look for whatever stage someone is in .
and i can have empathy for every person at every stage because ive been through many stage of my process .
and i think that it come back to why are you doing it ?
what do you want ?
if you are trying to disconnect from your phone why ?
for me i recently deleted instagram from my phone .
i did it last year for a month .
the book came out and i wa i got ta get back on .
i got to make sure thing are good .
i get recently deleted it again .
and now everything that i post everything flow through my team .
i am not it is gone .
it is now i happen to to flow everything flow through my team .
why did i do that though ?
wa because i do not want to live my life on that phone .
and the one thing that i noticed is that instagram wa one of the thing where i would pick it up and i would somehow get to it .
and i wasnt even thinking about getting to it .
and i wa my life is not this little tiny thing .
my life is everything thats out here .
and why do i want to get why did i delete it wa because i want to be in everything .
i want to be present with my life .
when we have child i want to be present with our child .
i want to be the most present version of myself a i possibly can .
and i can not imagine that ill get to the end of my life be one hundred year old and be i wish i would spend more time on instagram .
i wish i would spend more time watching netflix .
and i have ive been addicted to all of those thing .
i am not above any of this stuff .
but i started looking at myself and saying is this helping me get to where i want to be in life ?
is it creating more peace in my life ?
for me it wa creating way more stress to u perpetuating these feeling that i am trying to let go of and trying to work with .
and for me i think whats important to people is if you want to make a change why do you want to make the change ?
and for me looking at a screen is not a important a physically being in front of my wife and giving her what she truly deserves which is a one hundred of my attention .
because there been time where ive not given her one hundred of my attention .
and a we start to have kid and stuff i do not want to be a distracted parent .
i want to be with them .
ill never sit there and go when my kid were kid my kid were child .
i wish i would spend more time on instagram .
i wish id spent more time watching netflix .
i think for me the level of the place i met in my life is i want to be a present a possible because ive worked for thing that ive climbed ladder .
ive gotten different place .
ive realized none of those thing fulfilled many way .
and this journey ive been on in the past ten year seven year ago and we started talking about the bag of agita and i started meditating a whole lot more and getting into a i realized these thing are bringing me peace .
and the more peaceful i feel the more that it becomes easy to achieve and create the stuff that i want to live for .
and for me the presence in the peace at this point in my life thing might change .
i do not know what it is going to be in five year or thing that are the most important to me .
yeah it is interesting .
i think we feel being anxious and being busy and stuff will create the most effectiveness. . but you said this idea of if you start from a place of peace .
and i think about the i completely agree with that .
if you walk into something with stillness it give you clarity give you perspective you can zoom out you can zoom in .
if you are buzzing around and moving around you lose all of that .
it is all blurry and fuzzy .
and i want to ask you whats whats a lesson you wish you learned earlier in life .
i think it is that what you are searching for externally you are searching for yourself .
i think thats become very apparent to me in the past few year is a i wa always looking for somebody to give me love somebody to give me acceptance to a chief that i could be accepted .
and what i truly think is what i wa searching for from everyone else is what i wa searching for for myself .
a lot of people that are a lot of people i know are people please they may rob them people easier .
and it is theyll change themself to try to get love and acceptance from somebody else .
but thats filling up it is a hungry ghost .
it is the food go through the ghost .
it doesnt go anywhere .
and what we are searching for is what we are searching that love and acceptance for ourselves .
and one of the biggest thing that i think ive learned in probably the past two year is i wa always trying to grow and change myself because there were aspect of myself that i did not .
and what ive changed into in the past couple of year is i am going to love every aspect of myself .
there some part of rob that are beautiful that are amazing that love people that want to connect there there some great part of rob .
there some part of rob also that are very selfish that are very judgmental that are a little bit short not a present a he should be .
instead of trying to change those and hate those ive tried to love them .
and realized that the selfish rob that exists wa some thing that he that wa a part of past conditioning that came up from needing to be selfish a a child for whatever it might have been whatever reason it might have been .
and i can love that what i realize is that if i try to change it it get stronger if i love it and i accept it it chill out .
i am not yeah these part of me do not exist .
it is me looking internal family system is a therapy where you look at all part of you and who you are and you try to figure out a way to understand how the entire orchestra work together .
when i wa writing my book i wa sitting there and i wa i wa going hard core .
you and i come from the world of creating viral video .
i would spend much time on every single line to make sure it wa perfect ?
because i wanted to make sure ive only got thirty second or a minute to get the the message to be a clear and concise a possible .
let me try to make a perfect a possible .
and i used to do a lot of poetry and i used to do a lot of songwriting when i wa younger .
i wa used to making every line a potent a i could .
a i wa writing this book i wa sixteen round of edits in editing every single piece of it .
and there a part of me that said it is said why are you doing this ?
why are you doing this ?
and i wa i want to write a book that help people and change people life .
i want someone to not know what the mindset of a pro podcast is but they walk in a barn and nobody see a book and they are interesting .
let me read it .
let me pick it up and they read it and it change their life .
and then i played devil advocator .
and i said but you also want it to be successful .
you also want it to be a new york time best seller .
you can have a little badge to put on your self and say new york time best seller .
you want it to be this incredibly selling thing because if it take off you are going to make great money for a very long time if it is a perennial seller .
and i thought to myself can i use that ego excited of me to help me create a better book ?
and i could .
and what i realized is instead of hating that aspect it is a tool in my tool belt .
when i need to bring that side of me out i can bring outside of that side of me out and say what ?
i am going to create the best freaking book that i can the best podcast that i can the best real that i can to try to impact people .
and it is not about trying to force change on myself .
it is about loving every aspect of myself .
the quote unquote good and bad even though there is no good or bad but every aspect of rob .
and if i need to use it i can bring it up and say hey rob i need this version of you now .
but i am not going to fight it anymore .
and the monastery we are doing is talking about how the word is an arthur which mean unwanted thing that seems unwanted need to be engaged .
you need to engage it in the service of doing something higher. ?
for it to be purified .
thats why you can not cut it out .
you can not get rid of it .
you can not hate it to go away .
you can not shame it away .
you can not guilt it away .
it ha to be engaged in a higher service .
i impacting others helping others improving your own life improving the life of others .
because when it is engaged then it becomes purified .
because if you ignore it it will stay there .
and if you try and push it away it is going to push back .
it is a strong way .
but if you engage and go yeah what ?
but i am going to use that tendency to try and help this people out of this person do this .
thats the only way that it start to be purified .
and that that resonates very strongly .
the other one i want to tell u wa whats the lesson you have to learn the hard way ?
i think the one thats been the most potent for a long time is you can not do it all on your own .
for me i do not think i wa able to trust people for a very long time .
i went to a therapist one time and he had said yeah youve been neglected .
and i wa no i havent been neglected .
i had food water shelter clothing all these thing .
he wa no you were emotionally neglected from your father .
and i wa my god ring true .
but what happened wa i had developed this feeling over my lifetime of ive got to do it alone .
i can not trust anybody .
there were time in my dad would even though he wa an amazing person .
i always tell people i wa i am grateful that i had the father that i had .
he wa he never beat me .
he never touched me inappropriately .
he would get drunk and fall asleep .
and when he fell asleep hed forget about me in a lot of different way ?
there wa that neglect of he would say i am going to come pick you up and we are going to go fishing .
because i have to florida .
and would sit on the front porch for an hour two hour of my fish and pull and he would never show up ?
and there were the aspect of that .
and i think somewhere along the line i developed this feeling of no one going to help me .
i have to do it all in my own which there a piece of that which there is some truth ?
i do have to sometimes step forward and be the person to do it .
but for the longest time i never understood the phrase no man is an island .
because i wa i have done everything by myself .
and then i started looking around me and i wa no i havent .
the universe is always been there giving me everything that i need in every person to help me in some way and proving it better .
and a everythings grown the podcast ha grown my my company ha grown all this stuff .
we have thirty people on the team i can not do it on my own .
i can not help people on my own the way that i wish that i could .
if i wa i am not thirty people .
i do not have thirty day .
they can get done and we can get done in one day that i could get done in an entire month .
and it is been big for me is trusting people to be able to help me and to be able to ask for help .
whether that be in a business but also going to my wife and be hey i am struggling now .
can you talk to me for a few minute ?
and knowing that she doesnt think he not man enough which is a fear that i had if i go to her with my problem shes going to be he not man enough .
but for her to be yeah let me hold space for you .
and i think the biggest thing for me is is learning that i can not do it all in my own .
it is to it is strength to ask for help .
it is strong task for help .
and and that i need to be better at asking for help when i do need it .
thats a great one .
thats a great one .
i can relate to it in many way .
and yeah it strike a chord for sure .
and i think many of u both of those question think about it .
whats taken whats the lesson you learned the hard way and whats the lesson you wish to learn earlier ?
and write them down because you might forget it .
and you fold back in that cycle often .
rob we end every on purpose episode with a final five. . these question have to be answered in one word to one sentence maximum .
thats it .
ill do my best .
rob these are your final five .
the first question is what is the best advice youve ever had or received ?
ill give you the sentence .
and if you want me explain it i can .
but everything is your fault .
yeah you can explain everything is your fault come back to you with a ceo of your life .
i my very first mentor that i had i paid five hundred a month to have my first coach when i wa nineteen about it is two thousand and twenty .
and we worked together for two year .
we had some great call .
i do not remember any of them .
and what it wa wa i had made many excuse a to why i wa late to call .
why i did not hit my assignment .
why i did not do what i needed to do .
and he had this tough conversation .
he said rob if a business succeeds whose fault is it ?
and i wa what do you mean ?
he if a business succeeds all one thousand employee move into the direction they have a successful year whose fault is it that the person who orchestrated i wa the ceo he said if a business fails whose fault is it ?
and a the ceo he said rob if you get to the end of your life and it is not what you wanted it to be .
and you did not create the life that you wanted to make the money you wanted to have to success the love of happiness travel place that you wanted to whose fault would it be ?
and he said if you did create the life that you wanted to you had the love of happiness the abundance everything that you wanted whose fault would that be ?
and i said it would be my fault .
and he said the problem with you is you are treating this life a if you are the victim .
and what you need to realize that everything that happens to you is you are fault and that your life will not change until you decide that you want to be the ceo of your life .
i do not know how that would have felt when you had it at that point .
yeah exactly .
with that mindset and i think a lot of people today would find that offensive they might get hurt by it .
they might what how did you transfer that energy to be no this is helpful .
it is not hurtful .
i wa a little bit hurt but there i felt truth .
because when i look at the path of where my life wa going to go had i continued to blame everybody else ?
it wasnt going to be good .
but when i looked at people who i knew who took full ownership of their life one of my probably my first mentor without even being on purpose wa my uncle dan who wa an incredibly successful guy .
how to bunch of success but also is incredibly giving always still loving .
and he never blamed anybody else for when his business failed and he brought it back from from nothing and rebuilt it .
he wa always there for everyone else .
but he always took everything a his responsibility .
and it is not everything thats happened to you in your life is your fault .
but whatever it is that you have a your responsibility to work through .
smith also said this ?
where it is it is not my fault that my father wa an alcoholic .
but it is my responsibility to do with what do with it because it is a reality that i have .
and i have to work through those thing .
and for me it wa it rang true where i wa i wa it is .
and if my life is going to change i have to be the person to change it .
and thats when it clicked for me .

welcome to this episode of the informal economy health and education podcast .
your enter is each item .
this episode i am joined here by city of obeil communication officer the national council .
welcome back .
thank you very much .
it is been quite a pleasure to meet you .
also joining u is city puewe when you are sitting here it is about obeil the assistant director of the city of obeil .
thank you .
and we are also joined by yohem emezi our youth informal trader from obeil .
thank you much .
to get them more rolling they were talking about highlyconservations .
they are important to the sector we consider the same that is the youth the resident the tutubi era the year to highlight how they walk through this process .
maybe you start by asking me what are the key highlight of the puewe twenty fourmage review and how will you impact business in the way ?
thank you very much .
excited to ask you about the activity .
a a local operator it is been very much a year our puewe twenty fourmage review .
first of all we are very excited about the response of the people who are teammate to ask if you can help u to get feedback on how we are performing a a local authority .
and the key highlight is that people are talking about the improved water that supply since improved it food for the people and improved revenue collection .
they are also talking about the initial frequenting of the one before the rain .
a a local authority we are very much happy and the major highlight wa the acquisition of our critical equipment much of the u.s. in the country .
we believe that this will impact business in spite of ensuring that people provide them with the service that they want all the time for example the water ensuring that there is proper sanitation proper health care and ensuring that the infrastructure is in order .
a a local authority we believe that we have much of the feedback that we got from the business association and the stakeholder at large .
it ha helped u to ensure that when we look at the footprint from the budget we share it in line with what the people want a the business authority .
if i can add any question of trust policy and accountability in this process what measure have been taken to ensure trust policy and accountability in the budgeting process ?
in the budgeting process for u to be transparent we should ensure that we update the budget approach which we always do and ensure that we also update the financial statement .
we always ensure that when it come to budget issue we will transfer it from day one .
for example we invite everyone who is supposed to be inputting in the budget from the review .
if you have realized what i said before we say that we invite everyone for the stakeholder to come and input and we also ensure that those who can not come easily can also participate using the eplatforms .
thats the way we try to ensure that we transfer it from all transfer it from all mean to all public meeting .
everything is covered even when we did the review we managed to ensure that it wa published on social medium platform .
we also included everybody what the president of the public is saying that we move you with the match of ensuring that if everyone is inputted no one is left behind .
it also incorporated sign language in every language that even those who can not work even those who can not not hear who understand what we are doing .
and talking of engagement the eplatforms the social medium platform how do we cancel engaging with the resident and stakeholder in the two thousand and twenty budgeting process ?
and we are also going to be having eplaces and ecookies also participate in live voting in not taking public meeting .
evolving resits i think this is a little bit good to give u the possibility how we are participating in those thing and what change do we expect in this year process ?
i think a a homeless we need to appreciate our local authority in term of how they are trying to do their budget consultation .
there ha been a very serious difference from the way that they used to do their budget consultation particularly the budget formulation because budget on it own is not an event but it is a process .
but now that we are also engaged in term of budget review it is good to u to our local authority .
but now we inputted from the very first and we also reviewed the budget .
that mean that it give u confidence in term of where we are going a a local authority .
we appreciate that .
we will continue engaging .
we have been put in a far a education and health is concerned .
we are pleased to note that in two thousand and twentytwenty four by two thousand and twentytwenty four by two thousand and twenty we took the budget review .
we were talking about the issue to do with increasing school .
we were talking about issue to do with having health facility taming the offsale bar into a clinic having a new site in term of coming up with a mother school in koba eighteen .
these are real serious issue that we are advocating for in the agreement .
the inclusion of pwds .
we are advocating for that in the entire community .
we are saying we have been intact and we are here .
you are going to ask me to take a peek to ask you again to say a you feel if you participated in the pilot consultation before maybe next time let say it will not happen .
and what are the feeling that you feel are part of the process ? .
i think i will start with the national part of it because it draw from that aspect .
and i would to appreciate the government for being inclusive and making sure the marginalized community is involved .
but however a in formal trade we felt that it wa a rushed process .
one week it wa such a little time when we were talking about the national budget pilot consultation and we felt that the time given wa competing with our business .
you could calculate going to koepe or fuma and the impact it would have on your business .
we ended up choosing our household and assuming that those who are being who may be talking on behalf coming back to the local authority would also to appreciate what the city council is doing .
but it seems much significant improvement in trying to be inclusive and they are in way inclusive .
but yeah far we have been trying to start the local bioprocesses .
and from the previous experience yeah we hope mr. paragasio wa saying that they are not being inclusive the eplatforms the doortodoor session that they are going to .
a a few minute about it what do you want to see included in the package particularly in regard to marketplace and other education ?
in term of marketplace we wish to have more place allocated for u because take for example the catered mouse that is happening in our local authority it is not something that is safe for human .
all the time woman are running and the car they are at it very risk .
and also it spray the resource from the part of the local authority using fuel main power and everything .
i think this budget should ensure that maybe more place are allocated with adequate facility that are needed .
in term of health i would appreciate if we have a maintenance award in the area of sanam koba we want in koba one year maintenance award to be resuscitated that it is not overwhelmed .
in term of school the same is mentioned the sector ha gone massively with we are extending the fire and fire and we do need school .
if we can make you what you promote a i say how can you support qe by promoting it a you build a particular example of an existing market in changing space ?
thank you very much .
i am very excited about what you said and i am looking at here which is a very young case .
id to encourage the youth to also attend these budget consultation meeting and also encourage the trade u to attend these budget consultation meeting because if you do not attend no one is going to come and speak and be a part of you .
in the hustling if you do not go on the hustling ground no one is going to hustle for you .
the same applies with attending budget consultation meeting .
you should come and do that .
if you can not come and attend these budget consultation meeting you also encourage the youth to attend the yes sir .
what if we plan for a formal tradeoff ?
if we plan for a formal tradeoff we are looking at the revamping of mutapa market .
it is something that weve planned .
if you are saying that the master plan we also need to be at every event well be telling you about the master plan .
it is in the master plan when we say that we need to consider informal trader we need to consider trader in the city of kiru and ensure that they have place that are habitable ensure that they have decent trading space .
for u we want to develop it to be a hub of marketing but it should be healthy it should be decent .
thats one .
we are also looking at ip market .
it is almost it is ninety complete .
we are also looking at for my market it is eighty five complete .
we are hoping that by the year two thousand and twenty five well be talking about these percentage but we are excited that weve done something .
and we are also looking at different area where the informal trader are coming from from the one .
and i think that in essence you do not need to come in haseulita .
you can do it where you stay because thats where the people are .
a a local authority this is some of the thing that we are looking at in the year two thousand and twenty five .
we need to set up space for informal trader in the area that they stay in back at their home because thats where the people are staying .
the size of the informal trader the way they choose to live what are the most specific need and priority ?
what is the degree and how can they catch on this in the future ? .
thank you very much itai .
this is water .
we can not run away from that .
they want water .
if you can talk about everything in here but immediately that they want is water .
and a a local authority it is our number one priority .
we always laugh when we have meeting to say that engineer in the land of the city water land of the city or water .
we are looking at the entire system from the point when someone open their tap and get water .
we need to leave them all of that .
we have our engineer they are looking into best way of ensuring that we improve .
far if we notice we have improved we have been pumping water from thirty.eight megalitres to around fifty eight time sixty megalitres per day which is good for u . we want to continue improving the water supply in the city .
also ensuring that water reach the place that it ha not been reaching .
for example in richmond we have challenge in cobra nineteen we have challenge .
we are not quiet a a local authority .
these are thing that we keep on looking at and trying to find solution to it .
trying to see how best we can give water .
we are seeing in two thousand and twenty five we do not quite end excuse .
then the other thing in term of engagement what we need to see them improving on is the issue to do with thematic committee leading to budget .
yes we have been together in term of budget review which is correct .
we have been together in term of putting into the budget which is .
but we also then need thematic committee thematic committee which will then speak to sectorspecific issue .
she said she is in the informal sector .
they are the only people who can better explain the challenge that they are meeting .
if you are going to formulate a thematic committee that speaks to the informal sector then it make sense .
i think by and large what our local authority need to improve is communication .
yes they have done that sending message on whatsapp platform sending message on their website they also have facebook pay .
they are trying to do that but in term of those that are new to social medium we then need to find a way of making sure that they have to pas it .
i think effective communication is one area that you might need to improve on .
because yes on social medium we are very effective .
i think our pr department is one of the best in the country but are we reaching all the number of people that are not in person but we need to take away .
i think in term of communication they can do that .
moving on to your question how do you think camp are facilitated for the most in the transmaritime budgeting process ?
and not only the regulatory but you can also speak to mr. likue here to say that there is a risk of selection .
how do they need to push that maybe people are able to attend these issue of floating out or i do not know if each of you improved .
if it improved whats your take on it ?
i am thinking i appreciate the online platform in accepting technology but sometimes i think we have to go back home because the informal trader are enixed back .
and sometimes they use mailing in person with disability hearing impairment .
if you use mailing to them they are not being communicated with .
we need to ensure that all those proper structure that queer city council ensure that the word have the word committee are put to good use to ensure that thing are not running and everyone is involved .
sometimes we are assuming that maybe the municipality police will not have been informed but they do not know .
this can only be addressed if we have a gender based .
and coming back to you mr. selypio yes now the boy is in your hand water is improved and everything is the noise is down a bit .
the honour is now to you to help encourage the resident to now honour that council can also operate smoothly .
thank you .
may i invite all the gbvs what solid promise are you going to give now to the resident of queer city council ?
thank you for having u . whats new ?
we are looking at helping the two thousand and twenty five material world if it is coming up .
we are trying to find a way to set it to be coming up in the two thousand and twenty five budget .
i can not promise anything for the two thousand and twenty five budget .
the budget belongs to the people of queer .
the people of queer make the budget .
they should come and make the budget .
they should come and make it happen .
queer who belongs to the people of queer .
we can not do anything without the people of the city of queer .
whatever they want u to do is exactly what we will do a a local authority .
where we face challenge they should also come up and say you are facing this challenge maybe we can help with this .
i am happy about the reason the social medium and the city of queer .
they always come up to the local authority to say but you can fix this this way .
it is always good when we have all those idea to help improve the city of queer .
thank you very much .
there you have it people of queer .
in two thousand and twenty three we want to see improved participation in the next day for being here with u . and i think it is time to talk to the people of queer from queer perspective .
thank you very much .

lindsay and i will let her pronounce her last name with big sky life book talking about one of my very favorite topic .
lindsay is the former chief clerk for the montana house of representative who served under three speaker of the house .
she ha fifteen year experience in state politics .
shes married and a homeschooling mother of three child and she is the founder of big sky life book which is an online childrens bookstore serving a a trusted resource of wholesome book for child .
and i frequent her site often .
lindsay welcome to the podcast and thank you much for joining me today .
thank you for having me .
yeah lindsay brogandue .
and that is dutch .
i think i knew that a while ago .
lindsay and i met about a year and a half ago .
we discovered this wonderful site that i do not know if it is a good thing i discovered it because ive been a frequent customer since then but i am thrilled that big sky life book is in existence .
and why do not you share with the audience how you made the move from fifteen year in state politics to running this wholesome beautiful online bookstore for child ?
yeah absolutely .
thank you much for having me .
i think i had my first child and i went through a legislative session leaving him and decided to step away from that and focus on my kid .
now we have three .
and with the child came a lot more book and the love of reading my kid .
and i also married somebody who love going to bookstore used bookstore .
we do not have very many new bookstore anymore .
we would go to these used bookstore and i wa looking in the childrens section and you saw all of these agenda being pushed specifically barnes noble and chapter .
i know there are good book corduroy curious george all the great vintage favorite but you couldnt find them .
and it wa it wa discouraging .
and i also talked to some elderly friend who wanted to buy book for their grandkids and they did not have a bookstore to go thumb through them and you shop online and you do not know whats whats beneath that cover .
i i had a dream a couple of year ago and i dreamt what if we had a room or an online store where everything wa preread everything wa wholesome .
people could trust anything in there .
and you could judge a book by it cover .
and if it looked pretty you knew it wa wholesome on the inside .
and i had this dream and i woke up and told my husband and he said let do it .
let build an online childrens bookstore and he the tech behind all of it .
hundred of hour have gone into it but it is been a joy .
and people have a source they can go to that they can trust everything in there .
and thats been fun to be able to provide that .
yeah ive seen your video of you packing these book and i it is weird .
i sit there and watch it because i love watching what book did they order ?
it is in your room your storehouse of the book is amazing .
when we met about a year and a half ago you were getting off the ground .
but ive watched your the the market for what you are you are selling explode over the last year and a half .
i know people who are thankful for it and ive watched it explode .
talk a little bit about when you first started and where you are today and how thats very different .
my goodness .
i remember when we launched the business and we had a friend over and we got that first shop of iding .
i got an order and it wa my friend who wa saying that that wa our first customer which is such a gift .
and friend and family were supportive .
but i remember when it wa the first order from someone i had never met .
and now order come through every day and it is much fun to see what people have put picked out from our site .
it is it is fun every time you get an order and what did they choose ?
and you get to pack it up .
but along the way it ha been a lot of work .
it is also hard to navigate google and being able to rank .
if someone put in wholesome book for child we pop up .
my husband worked hard on that that we have seo worked out and we are showing up .
and there been many people with platform that have also shared about u to help spread the word .
i think thats been the biggest gift people that have been excited about it you all and shared about it .
and that ha spurred on the growth to where we are now .
and we i think we celebrated two year two year .
yeah it is been a lot of work but it is been a lot of fun .
now we order book from fifty might be more than fifty now different publisher .
and i think we are around eight hundred book in our shop .
we also started with collection .
my biggest thing wa i would see book blogger they would have a thanksgiving collection or a christmas collection .
and it wa all wholesome .
and i would click on it to buy it and it would take me to amazon .
and i wa i do not i love this collection .
initially we started with collection .
i think we had about forty five collection .
and then the demand wa there to buy them individually .
we now offer the collection still because i love the one we put together .
but you can also order all of them individually a . and no i love your collection a a teacher .
if if you are focusing on one particular thing i loved you had a patriotic collection .
and i wa able to incorporate that into my classroom .
but then some of your collection are about certain characteristic honesty courage .
i love the courage collection .
thats you have one on inventor and scientist .
i love the collection .
and of course if anybody is giving a gift for baby youve got lot of great collection for baby too .
they are much fun .
yeah doing the character trait wa exciting for u . i do not know of another bookstore that sort their book by character trait .
and i think reading book on courage and perseverance and integrity and instilling those value a the child reading about them .
it wa important for u . and it ha been a big hit with our with our audience a . yeah .
and you have story about real people .
many of your book are are nonfiction .
and they are real people who exemplified courage .
and and then we were talking before about the scientist that you have on there .
granted in one of the collection there it is a mouse telling the story but it is telling the true story of this real person who followed their curiosity to to discover certain thing that we are very thankful for today .
and then you you start when we first met you were catering to baby and younger child and then elementary .
but since then youve branched out .
you now have book that are nine to twelve year old maybe middle school range .
can you talk about some of those ?
and i do have several of those .
we were at twenty twenty chapter book on our site now with more being added every month .
but this one snow treasure is a hit from my childhood .
it is a true story of courage .
and i think it is for all age .
but then if a child wa reading it themselves then you would get into the eight to twelve year old range .
and then we added this one which i am sure nobody will know about because it is brand new .
sure hope is for age twelve on up .
and adult i read this book .
it wa incredible .
it wa major crime major laugh faith in family and value are interwoven through the entire story .
it is a fabulous book .
that one age twelve and up but it would be a great read if you read it with your kid if you had mature ten to twelve year old a . yeah .
and of course where the red burn grows is a great one for all age .
we let great until you get to the end .
i know we have some vintage favorite .
i love the whole thing with this is we do not need to recreate the wheel .
there are many great wholesome book that are already written .
i want to pull those in .
thats reassuring for parent because a a their kid get older i have four kid who were voracious reader throughout their entire .
and at any given time they could have four different huge chapter book .
there wa no way in the world that i could vet everything they were reading and know that it wa all good and wholesome .
that is an incredible thing for parent to know that they can order book for their preteen or teen from your website .
eventually youll have more and then and trust that that they are not going to run into any contentious material in there that this shirt some of the book are going to be sad .
there might be book about war that thing but we are not going to be pushing an agenda in some of those book .
i wa listening to a podcast last week and there wa it wa a podcast about classic .
and they talked about the reason that they are classic is because theyve been stress tested over time .
and thats what make them classic .
and when i think about some of the book where the red fern grows or little house on the prairie even granted those are not maybe a stress tested over such a period of time .
but they are the if you present one of those book to someone today an adult today they are going to fondly remember those book from their childhood and know that it wa worth reading and they would read it again a an adult .
ive probably read charlotte web now a dozen time to different group of student and every time i am this is the best book ever .
it is .
i do not we do not need to reinvent the wheel necessary .
and there are story worth reading and retelling to to child today and and letting them experience that .
thats thats exciting that you are branching off into that .
and i know youll have your work cut out for you because it is harder to screen chapter book than it is picture book .
i know weve had such a such a demand for it .
people are clamoring for the chapter book .
we are also going to be releasing all the missionary biography christian hero then and now those will be coming to our shop .
yeah a lot of them coming down the pipeline .
stay tuned .
i do not want to put you on the spot but i would love to know because weve gotten this question from parent teacher a a school leader about alternative book fair vendor .
and i am thinking about the book that you offer .
you have some faith based book you have some secular book you have some a little bit for everything .
do yourself somewhere down the road offering that a an option for school ?
wow i havent asked .
i havent asked this question .
and i think now there are some good option .
i havent taken a deep dive into them but i know there a couple of good option for scholastic book fair alternative for me to do that .
it would you are buying massive quantity from the publisher in order to get a discount enough to do the book fair .
there more logistics involved .
i have wanted to in the old day when scholastic would have that thin paper booklet that you could circle what you wanted .
i wanted to put all of our book in i guess not all but a lot of our book and one of those that people can flip through and see what we have .
i thought thatd be much fun .
book fair i do not know .
i think i would i would probably first do a deep dive into the one that are doing it currently and see .
but i also i have talked to a couple of school to see how we can do an alternative .
maybe provide a source for the librarian to be purchasing book for their library noting that everything is preread and vetted .
i think to start we are working with some library to do that .
we already have some library that purchase from u . that might be our first step towards that book fair .
thats thats quite entertaining .
i am planting a seed because i certainly would love to one day when i have grandchild who go to a book fair i would love for them to have those book there to buy .
and you are talking about the school book fair ?
but i love that you are working with library and that they are refilling their shelf with with book from from you .
one of the thing for our audience maybe if you do not know we have hosted a good book drive where we raised money and were able to send wholesome book bundle to classroom all across the country .
and we were able to raise about ten thousand dollar which meant lot of book going into classroom .
the teacher were absolutely thrilled to receive these book .
and one of the elementary school that we sent a bundle to and we sent big skylife book to them i wa told that this school wa a book desert .
and that broke my heart because i am thinking i bet every student probably ha a chromebook or an ipad that they are on but they are they are missing out on book .
and i do not know if parent understand how many good book have been discarded .
and i use that word on purpose because you can open up the flap of the book and see the word discard off of the shelf .
and theyve ushered in ipads or chromebooks and have tossed out .
i would encourage parent to recommend people big skylife book a hey we need to refill our shelf .
let look to big skylife book and we can trust that they are going to be good wholesome book that we do not have to worry about any agenda being pushed or inappropriate material popping up that we did not know wa in there .
i hope parent and any teacher that are listening will know this is a good opportunity if they are needing to restock their empty bookshelf .
but that wa much fun last year .
we we sent many book bundle all over the country .
and that wa such a gift for me to be able to send them and then for you all to raise the money to get them to the school .
that wa incredible .
and seeing the picture also of them being delivered and the kid reading them .
and it is also there might not be inappropriate content in our book but there also much rich value in them .
when the kid are reading them it is not fluff .
it is they are learning about great explorer or they are learning about courage and these character trait are automatically being instilled in these kid through these incredible story that theyll remember .
and i love i love that we are able to get our book through you all into the school .
it is fantastic .
and we are we are planning on doing it again this year .
and we are hoping to double the number of bundle that go out .
thats the goal .
if anybodys listening and want to write u a check know that the money is going to good use and the teacher were appreciative .
we went to denver colorado to a teacher summit this summer .
and we got to meet a couple of the teacher who were recipient of the bundle .
and they were they were thanking me .
i am the book did not come for me and the money did not come for me .
but you are very welcome because what a wonderful thing to send .
they were appreciative .
but it is funny that you say that these are wonderful book that that these student will remember the lesson that they learn in there .
because at that summit we had a display of a wholesome book bundle from big sky life book .
it wa one .
and i think poky little puppy wa in there .
big and your fancy .
there were there were a couple of i think we had about five book up there .
the reaction of the teacher coming to our table and seeing these book that they remembered from their childhood wa priceless .
and it is think about that .
think about how much these book mean to you today a a whole grown adult some of them not that young .
and think about how thats going to impact these childrens day to read that .
and those are the book that we need to be putting into the hand of child .
and thats why i am glad that we partnered with big sky life book and are able to send book that that you are selling that into these classroom .
it may be the only place that some of these child experienced these beautiful story .
it is true that we sent book to one city here in montana through you all .
and the student there ninety nine percent of them are below the poverty line .
and they do not have a bookshelf full of amazing book at home .
they do not even have food .
they are not even getting lunch dinner breakfast at home .
but we were able to through you all to send these book to their classroom that they are going to see these rich story in the classroom at their school .
that wa that wa neat to see the picture of these kid cherishing these book .
and you talk about wanting to put all your book in a in a paper a scholastic thing because thats how they did that .
and and i think that putting the book in their hand not saying open up that app and read that book but they get to they get to turn the page .
they get to go back and look at that picture of the pokey little puppy that they want to see again .
and they it is it is the whole experience is something that theyll remember forever .
and i love that that we are able to do that together .
and again maybe there somebody in the audience wanted to support this and it would be fantastic .
yeah it is still is not it still on your website the link to donate .

and it take him year and then it doesnt work .
youve got perseverance and someone who did not quit until the very end .
and he created himself .

it is a two of you .
when you are season you are it do not matter when you jump in we are a glad to have you in .
what debbie ha said the topic for the nine is one that i feel is going to be in far reaching .
by the west and that is setting up masterclass course setting up masterclass course .
our education system is allterrain .
whether we lack it or not whether we believe it or not it is happening before our eye .
parent teacher listen up .
they are confused about the random change .
they are arguing and posed on them since the onset of covidnineteen .
teacher are leaving and drove and they are disgusted .
mismanaged by forcing them to learn thing .
they do not want to know or need to know .
and place they have no clue about we need direction .
we need question to be answered .
we need process and pattern that we can find a guide to .
and for this purpose we have educational consultant we have here tonight on the podcast .
thats going to tell u why .
it is important that not only we create masterclasses but we tailor make these class for those different school culture .
we have to ask the question .
and these question help our country developer prepare and gather all the resource .
they need for their masterclasses .
what they are being said tonight we are going to talk a little bit about how to set up when to set up a masterclass and what to expect from those masterclass course .
first i want to go to sandy robert .
sandy robert ha been a while since we have had you on the podcast .
last time you were on it wa amazing .
we got some comment .
what wa your thought when we get you to talk for tonight ?
it could not possibly be better timing .
this is perfect in that .
when you are here with i am up to now you are going to go wow her name wa out there in the ether and no wonder i picked up on that master to come tonight .
we are going to go to it .
what do you have to do ?
what do you have to do ?
what do you have to do ?
here what i am up to .
i had retired from teaching at the community college in the psychology department .
and before i do not covid took everything apart .
and that .
and before that ended i wa also teaching i wa teaching dual enrollment course a psych one on one in cultural psych to the college charter high school .
and that wa a small high school with over a hundred student .
and marvelous .
and with the best high school principal i have ever met in my entire life .
and that that that ended with covid .
that wa that fall apart .
i wa doing other thing after that .
but then in the past and not even two month a little bit more than a month .
and now i got a call from my high school principal guy .
and he had he he left where he had been with the college .
and his ha taken a position with a high school from the indian reservation .
remember we are in arizona .
and asked if i would come and teach some dual enrollment class for him .
and he would you please come out of retirement and you teach these class .
and he he the best principal .
and that that i have ever worked with .
and the probably what i am going to do is ill be teaching a couple of class for him .
second semester .
after the holiday break and everything .
and i am i am looking forward to it .
and i went out and spent a day after school .
and they were doing some event .
and it wa it felt comfortable .
it wa worth being there to help him to help the student to be involved in the community .
and to be able to bring different aspect of the meaning of psychology and culture et cetera .
and be able to work and communicate with the native american community .
it is i am thrilled to be doing this .
total pain in the neck .
i had to trip trip down .
credential and all these kind of thing .
where is this ?
and it is i am looking forward to only get started after the first two year .
ill teach second semester .
and ill teach two class that the student will try to get to see your student first since theyll be graduating .
and then see what we are going to do with the rest of the student .
but it is it is invigorating to be someplace where they want you .
and that is key to almost anything that we are doing .
i have i have dealt with school where one of my favorite story is i wa fight based at a high school in california .
and it wa small high school .
and then down the coast from san francisco .
and pretty isolated from the other community a far a traveling .
and that to get to the main peninsula where to get up to san francisco .
everything wa over a mountain path .
and it wa it wa a wonderful experience .
but nobody wanted to be in campus .
the the county wa the county driving off the hall convention wa paying for me to be on campus .
everything wa you have to be here .
and then one morning i get a call at fifty oclock in the morning from the principal .
and he say there been a gang fight .
there problem .
they are all fighting .
how fast can you get here ?
and that wa a major turning point .
i do not want somebody to have to have a crisis in order to listen .
but up until that moment he could see no value in and someone being there wa different kind of skill .
and that moment which you do not necessarily want .
and that it wa a turning point .
and that wa it wa perceived completely different after that .
sometimes you have to stick it out .
that then the bottom line is helping to use .
but the thing that they need the thing that they deserve to have .
that if someone is not advocating for them is not it ?
is it an adult advocating for them that they are going to miss out on ?
what do you think ?
because a lot of people may not know they could know but i know you can explain it .
can i explain to the listener what is dual enrollment ?
what doe that mean ?
dual enrollment mean that i am teaching a college course .
the same exact course that i teach at the college for college credit to high school student .
and they are earning college credit .
and i am able to go in and teach the same psychology class that i am teaching at the college and they are getting college credit .
if i teach two course in the spring semester after the holiday break in school and january and that there will be student who will have six college unit a they go when they graduate from high school .
you can see thats incredible .
no that is incredible .
and it is necessary and it is crucial and when i say it is necessary and why i say it is crucial .
because there is a lot of social economically disadvantaged adolescent there in school especially those public school .
and we got poverty there .
we got people that are living in a single parent house hold ?
and where in most case the mom ha to bring home the bacon .
then she ha to cook the bacon .
and then she ha to put the kid to bed after them eating the bacon and getting the ready and doing homework .
this is tiring ?
in most case that poverty is there and that also you have bullying ?
thats also there in that mix thats being dealt with .
now we are in this demographic we are in this area and we are dealing with many challenge ?
and then let throw in covidnineteen and monkey park ?
there much going on .
let me go to the body of thornton pot such change in pro .
we are the pot such change in pro because he ha gifted in this area he able to take complex challenge and chew on them and when he regurgates .
he able to section them off in a way that people can understand and they can see the way he illustrates and paint the picture .
but he thought what wa your thought when you got the topic for tonight ?
i believe that because of covid obviously we had virtual learning and we had digital learning we had in person learning for decade before covid .
but covid created a situation where we were forced to stop incrementally innovating and tweaking the learning process .
and we had to look at disruptive innovation we had to look at creating an entirely new model .
and the hybrid model that ha been used by a lot of the school system is the height of what i to call incremental innovation .
they took what they could out of each system and they put them together and some very very high level people and some people who were willing to think outside the box .
step up and said this is not good enough .
we need to tear it apart and we need to make it all together again .
and youve got people who looked at how we teach people and how people learn and they started creating a system that would allow u to escape age barrier escape .
demographic escape affluence versus nonaffluence and start treating people and educating people based on where they are now .
and thats what i see in the master class that ive observed and that instructor ive talked to across the country they are all saying the same thing .
they are tweaking different portion of their master class that they can start from the very very low end all the way to the very high end and they are reinventing education based on where the learner is not where the education system think they need to be .
and thats where i got out of when i used to start .
absolutely we thank you for that .
when you were talking i could not help but think about affluence how people are affluent and they come into a situation and they give a motivation to different situation that change the course of how people see thing and how people interact .
and you have those people that have influence that are able to naturally come into a situation not even knowing sometimes that they even have influence .
and people are inclined to follow every step that they make and it is that guidance .
and it help u become effective and become effective .
i would say across the board and we are living in this society now that what do you want to believe in ?
coming out of covidnineteen that wa a very helpless and a very hopeless .
i believe this is my thought .
and i think thats a time in our life in the world where people could not find what wa next .
you had some people out there that those gifted people they have influence and influence that were thinking forward .
yourself and sandy who who we are thinking when this is a time period this is an era and time .
we are going to come out of this and we need to have thing set in place that when we cross this bridge when we transition from this place .
we need to have something thats appropriate something thats effective and something thats necessary for the people to help build them back up .
and when we talk about building people back up that is not a lightweight .
there not a lightweight duty there not lightweight task .
and i believe you have to have some passion you have to have some love you got to have .
let me ask what do you have to have ?
what did you have to have ?
what feel your passion especially coming out of covidnineteen ?
because both do you have done much from from before covidnineteen to now what ha felt what is the most single thing ?
what is the single thing ?
there ha filled your passion to create .
that would be my first question across the board .
this is the panel open .
who want to take their first ?
when you were saying that what came to my mind is these thing that ha worked the best for me and for the school for the past all the way back to .
i would say twenty some year at least .
and that is that there need to be and for me a far a i am concerned that .
and that there ha to be this in every school and that if they are going to make some progress we need peer program .
we need the student teaching each other .
they need to i do not usually sorry promote my website .
but if you go to my website sandyrowrits.com there a whole thing on peer counseling program and that and that student student and the student turn teen middle school etc .
they turn to each other long before thats all apparent whats wrong ?
and they are within the scope of the peer counseling program are adult who can help bridge that and who can help them be able to talk to their parent .
otherwise otherwise you have tragedy and that serious tragedy suicidal tragedy .
the other piece is within the framework of how i am at buddy and that is calcic resolution .
and that when these kid know how to help themselves in each other through what i would call basic mental health emotional health etc .
with the peer counseling then they need to know how to resolve conflict .
and when they need when they are able to help each other get past the difficult time and know how to sit down and to start to be able to in a positive way the personalized something that they can deconstruct it and build it up stronger .
and those two avenue are what do you think buddy ?
i couldnt agree more .
the two thing that kid need to know that they can build competency is the two thing that drive them on the genetic level .
there no such thing a a teenager who doesnt want socialization .
and there only one thing that they fear in socialization is that is that it is going to become an outcast or be ostracized .
if they do not learn a how to become relational and b you learn how to handle conflict a it emerges that they do not become ostracized .
and then they they are not meeting their need and every teenager every child for say age ten eleven all the way into the early 20 face that dynamic .
it is it is not something that we should be debating about .
it is something that there should be consensus about and we should plan everything around that dynamic .
yes and it would end up happening is they say no we need to do this other branch of english nine hundred and seventy eight and a half and the heck with the social competency skill .
and i know i saw harsh on that but sometimes if they do not take the time to help the person build the person and address the internal thing that they have going on and whatevers happening is home .
i want to add one thing to that too when you start looking at the difference between affluent and not affluent population .
the affluent population are not necessarily benefited by because they are entitled and they have access to a larger amount of resource .
that handicap them in some circumstance and ill give you the reason i say that there a continuum for all kind of behavior .
and when we have the gift of technology and we have the gift to be able to grab our smartphone and look up anything .
how important is it to learn some of the raw basic skill that are being taught in school core knowledge .
but now go to the other extreme because if it is good on running and it ha to also be good on the other if .
if you were to all of a sudden go into the forest with the mosco pirotry and the amazon .
i have absolutely no clue what a smartphone is who look for turtle egg and thats what they is their main diet and they they look at modern man a if we are a bunch of lazy and consider it can not do anything people .
if you sent our normal teenager into that environment they would be a baby without a diaper .
they wouldnt be able to function whatsoever .
but if they had relationship skill and they understood how to observe and learn and adapt and avoid conflict they could survive .
there no other skill that we can teach these kid that if we were all a sudden bombed about back to the stone age out because of some crazy war that happens .
the one who can not adapt and have those skill will not survive .
the only survivor will be the one who embrace outrace to press a crossing and understand the power of being relationship .
what you said wa profound and you talked about culture and for those who listen culture for me simply is a way of life .
a way of life for people how people live thats their way of life .
and being observing being observing meaning i am watching how this person life and i respect the way they live .
we are doing the anti bullying campaign but we also have an anti bullying course and one of the survey question that we ask is the dis training teach you to take action by helping the victim .
because we want to know if they understand what it mean to help someone that need help this is very important another question we ask in the survey is .
the survey or the dis training teach you to take action by shifting the focus and redirecting the bully away from the victim and these are some question that we ask .
our participant or our student that go through these training because this is how we design our course i wa bullied a a child .
and thats why i developed this anti bullying course that this anti bullying campaign because i learned a lot of i got a lot of tool on how to manage bullying let me answer the question and open up the panel .
how did you start your first master class course who want to take the first .
when i wa trying to decide how to take the information that i believe that would be beneficial when i pivoted from my larger career to my second life .
american are not supposed to have a second or a third act and i think seeing it and i are both probably on our third or four ha that that get blown out of the water .
but what i wanted to look at wa what would be the outcome and is the outcome relevant to the receiver .
and is the topic something that the instructor can have passion about .
because whats missing in education is the passionate teacher the role model the passionate role model because .
if you do not have passion about a topic you are only going to teach wrote information and you may not even be able to test some of the nuance of the topic .
but if you have passion about the topic .
then you can create an overwhelming picasso course that master course that will hit a lot of the high point and the low point .
and you build a library of answer that you may not have had at some of your student or someone may have had you have to build it that it is on the directional you are not disseminating information .
and you have to be willing to adapt to incoming and new information and the more knowledgeable other .
there someone take a class and they go i think you have that wrong and they are you have to number one admitted to included in the next version of the course and keep adapting .
education is not static which is one of the biggest problem in the american education system but thats how i do my master class .
but started me wa realizing that that wa the pivot point .
said that it stated .
i think that we have to loop around sometimes where the teacher sometimes where the student and it is always it is not we do not stop being the student because we have thing that we can be the teacher in .
i always have to be open to where is this going how all have thing changed .
it is always a matter of it go on and it is it is slow and then we all those of u who have been trained and who know people whove been trained and thats the handle .
there are tough situation they are able to help u be able to reach enough people .
there were many time and i am sure youve had the same thing .
there were many time that i would be trying to help a school or help a program or something that and it would come down to that someone would have to tell them that they had to do that .
they had to extract the class except the training except what i wa able to teach them .
or they would lose something maybe you some of their funding or something that from the county that are funding school .
and the state and it wa weird to have someone from the state department of education or from the county say you need to have her come and talk to your student otherwise .
we are we are not going to fund some of these thing that you want to do and i am absolutely call it tally wishing that that wasnt the case that that there were more of the one that would say .
of course think having to come and talk to them about some of these other situation when i wa going to a classroom and talk to the student about specific prevention .
i would have at a certain point i would have the teacher go to the back of the room and then i would ask some question that the student were able to answer that were more .
topic driven question and the teacher wa supposed to be back there noticing who had their hand up who ha their hand up .
to answer is ha there ever been a suicide in your family do are you aware of this are you aware of how to handle a conflict would you to learn how to handle a conflict .
and and take a poll and be willing to do something with that but in each case it wa .
i happen to be fortunate to be in a progressive county in northern california and i wa fortunate that the county stood up for these thing the county wanted to see the school put in some peer program peer to peer .
and they were the one who would say we are going to have the statewide conference and who would to be a presenter and a couple year i took student who presented a the conference .
being able to have the financial and educational backing make all the difference in the world and the the school test to take responsibility for more than knowing how to add to and to .
we have many thing that need to be clarified we need to clarify first of all we need to clarify how do people learn .
people do not learn the same some people learn by singing some people learn by watching some people learn by hand on and it take those master communicator yourselves .
and to observe a situation and to determine this is going to fit for this these people and this group will benefit better they are going to understand why where we have to learn it this way because i have a strategy for this learning style .
ive developed a course thats going to give them the ability to understand different viewpoint .
i am going to have them improve the way they see thing .
if you have a course that help people to network i am going to improve their network skill .
if you have a course that help people talk about tough conversation i am going to help them apply not to giving them a more cohesive decision making skill .
and then let talk about tough conversation .
i feel and i could be wrong because buddy i am i am i am you are laying now because you you wrote a book and you wrote a course called tough conversation tough choice and this is your tc squared but .
doe tc squared work with every learning style .
doe it affect people the same way across the board we know people receive information differently we know people .
give information differently .
why do we need to understand learning style and why do we learn understand these learn style .
that we know the possibility of how people are receiving what we say .
no they are viewpoint .
what we say they are perspective .
what we say doesnt even matter should we even share .
what they think when we are teaching them .
or do we want to teach to the test .
whats your thought .
why do we need to why do we need to understand learning style .
when you said you were getting my lane yet you you jumped in there and you planted yourself on that center line .
let let look at one thing very important when you talk about conflict a an example .
and you are talking about why you need to understand learning style because conflict only ha three source .
especially if it is conflict in a group inspired .
there task oriented conflict based on perception of who doing what who not doing what .
there relationship oriented who who buddy enough with who who ganged up on who and then there value oriented conflict .
and that come from people who value the outcome or people who valued participating in the process and there there a it is infinite number of way you can paint those three different artifact but task oriented relationship oriented and value oriented are the basic origin of all conflict .
but now let touch that to learning style .
everyone always say there a visual auditory and kinesthetic learning style but that doesnt paint the whole picture .
the visual auditory or what we to call observational learning style .
kinesthetic is doing but there two different type of doing .
there physical doing where you are manipulating your biology to get something done and then there reading writing interactive communication .
and taking a conversation up the ladder with someone else that you can co learn at the same time thats another form of kinesthetic learning .
there four main way to learn and then there those hybrid thing that interact with all four of those main and thats logical learning .
thats social learning social learning .
it can not be done in any other way you can not do it by yourself .
and then the flip side of that coin you have self driven solitary learning .
and then what we have is naturalistic learning and thats part of child development thats part of how you get all your bias and how you get all of your opinion .
but those are the four main and the four hybrid type of learning .
but then we also have some style thing and you brought one end you said music .
music is a wonderful medium for some people to learn .
they can also learn not only information about what music doe what it brings the art the aesthetic value but they also learn that music suit the savage beast .
it is a calming effect .
it is a coping mechanism .
there an interpersonal learning .
there interpersonal learning .
there perspective making and perspective taking. . all these are thing that happen during human development .
and when you get to the end of the road and you are looking at a functional adult .
you have to look at the way adult learn a . adult have four basic learning style .
and then you are going to incorporate all of those other style .
because by the time you become a functional adult you may have a preferred style but you are going to incorporate all of the style .
but you then you separate it into matrix .
some people have to do thing by a mini driven system .
it is called step learning .
then there the talk about or reverse about or come to some type of consensus about .
and then there research where you can do it alone or in team .
another way to drive yourself back to that talk about scenario .
and then there those guy who are what i to call the super learner .
those are the guy who take that research in a loan or team and they pivot the other direction .
and they create they innovate .
they disrupt society .
and a you can see those main and those hybrid eight bunch that is in the development stage put you where you are a an adult .
and i think that it is a critical mission to join those two with a bridge .
you have to understand how those main developmental learning style become those adult style .
and the way you do that is you create an environment where you tell people that if you are not the expert in the room and how we define expert in the room is the person in the room with the most knowledge about the topic on the table .
but you should be perspective taking .
you should be actively listening .
you should be participating in asking question that you can get the information referring to such a way that you understand it .
because the goal is to be able to do perspective making to someone else later further down the line .
and what i to label that is a cocreation feedback cycle where you pivot back and forth between perspective taking and perspective making over and over and over again .
and the biology is simple .
the human brain ha over one hundred billion nerve cell .
there is no way any person can say i am only a visual learner .
thats not true .
you learn through every different process and the older you get the more you incorporate all those style .
but there ha to be a roadmap .
if you can not identify where someone is in the development stage and get them adapt and adopt all those other style when they become an adult they are going to be missing some component .
and all you have to look at today society to see where that get u . and thats why it is important to understand learning .
that wa high off the press .
lady and gentleman that wa very dirty process .
it is a throw .
listen but what you said i am going to change it up on you .
what you said if i put a beat to what you said it would be a rap song .
and i know rap ha those six patient and those rhythm .
it is the improv .
but it is hip hop. . it is hip hop .
it is freestyle .
it is improv .
it is improvisation .
man i forget all about it .
and i feel horrible .
i had a conversation with the legend george duke .
he wa not an musician a composer a tenor performer a film director .
he wa the gamut .
he wa a gamut .
he wa a prince of jazz .
this guy .
and i had a conversation with him .
and it wa about practice. . and he told me he said i said before you go out and play and do a set or whatever .
you want to call it .
he said do you practice the performance in your mind ?
and i said what ?
he said do you practice from a to z to performance in your mind ?
because if we were doing other movie this jazz composition .
and he said to me do you play that song in your mind ?
and improv do all the improvisation in your mind ?
before you go out and play it physically .
and i am beyond which i told him no i did not .
he said they are not learning that song .
because you are not utilizing all the part of your brain .
and here a guy that played with mile davis .
to create a big hand card .
to our cold train .
the list go on and on .
and what he telling me is what wa told to him from the master .
we got an unamasturated night .
surrey robert sandy robert .
sandy robert .
i am moving here tonight .
whats going on ?
i want to i want to i want to i want to i want to i want our basket this moment where i am being on the same pedestal with it is incredible it is incredible it is incredible .
it is incredible .
it is incredible .
it is incredible it is incredible .
it is real it is real .
no when buddy wa speaking thats thats where he at ?
and it is you got to find your leg .
and thats his leg thats where he at ?
thats his road thats his destiny .
and i see the sign .
i see the sign i see sign .
i would work a job and get a paycheck in two week .
and most of my paycheck went to jazz city .
it wa addiction .
it wa i had to get counseling .
it wa too much .
it wa too much .
but let me go here .
and improv this communication is interplay ?
because we are sitting i am sitting at an honest set .
and maybe i am on the piano ?
and the drummer he there or shes there ?
and the bass player there .
and the maybe it is the saxophonist there or a good guitar player .
and we are communicating .
we are all on one heat .
shes a music. ?
when the music say hey get loud .
when the music say go medium .
we have to go medium .
when the music say go soft .
we have to go soft .
when the music say you have to sickle paint this beat or this rhythm .
exactly at this point .
and it creates a motif .
or the thing .
we have to be there .
we have to communicate .
and the thing about music is when it is off .
everyone know it .
whereas when you are talking i believe the master they can hear when you get off .
miss andy .
whats the question ?
we are at least a miscommunication between people who do not have similar .
and i am not talking culture here but who doe not have similar value and belief .
what lead to that miscommunication ?
will these give them getting off the beat ?
will these give off the same she the music especially in the workplace ?
and them drifting off until no man land ?
what is going on here ?
please give u some wisdom and that matter .
there much of it that expectation of doing are often .
the expectation is but they are picking the wrong thing to tackle to do .
and if they were wanting to do a doctor or something that they know that they are going to need to commit to study etc .
the musician .
the musician is not going to open some case and automatically know how to work the instrument .
you can give me an incredible instrument .
and i open the case and i go what do i do ?
do i blow on it ?
what do i do to make it make music ?
i miss a lot of step along the way where we have expectation that somebody is supposed to know all these thing .
and we forget to inquire .
and that .
a someone said this is amazing .
ive had this experience with it .
would you to try it ?
and i might have to say do i blow on it ?
do i do something with my finger ?
what do i do with it ?
and we need to pas along these talent .
we need to pas along how to do thing .
and sometimes we get caught up and trying to manage trying to put food on the table trying to keep our relationship together that we get lost in them .
we get lost a a stuff .
and then little thing become the petty thing become huge .
and it is a hard place to be in but it is understandable .
and we are not bad for getting into those little side trip .
but what we do need to do is we need to look for when there someone that can help u move through it faster than if we have to figure the whole thing out on their own .
and then i am not musically talented .
i have a sister who is fabulous in musically talented .
and then she could play thing on the piano that you thought that she had studied for twenty year when she wa nine .
and that me it is i can not even play chopstick .
we have a group of different kind of i do not even know the name of the dance and thats everybody needed to be at the same place .
or a the same skill we can be a pretty boring country and everybody be doing the same thing .
and we need to look at that in our business in our relationship and in our school now they are busy teaching to the test and that they are not teaching the person .
and we have many place where we need to go back and say what are we helping the person with ?
what is going to help them survive and be able to utilize these skill ?
we are worried that weve come into a whole everythings taken away from u not given to u . and we need to get back into sharing .
we need to get back into how can this help more people ?
how can how can this help me ?
is that because i might be knowledgeable in one situation doesnt mean i am equally knowledgeable in another situation .
i where forever the teacher and the student and i think those are the thing that we have to remember .
we start to put pressure on someone to always be the teacher or always be the student and we give off track .
but but before you answer something to that let me say this real quick .
second robert you are loved .
when i say you are loved you are loved .
you are loved .
you talk when you talk about the way you dealt with communication you dealt with dimension .
when you dealt with it dimension dimension dimension are space dimension are environment dimension are layer dimension are our episode is an infrastructure .
at the panel is open i do not know but the panel is open and i can not wait to hear what buddy ha to say but when you talked about communication i heard the dimension are you open up door and different dimension and different layer .
buddy called it too but i can not wait to hear what buddy ha to say .
go ahead please i am sorry .
i think it is important that we pivot to someone who not here and i give him credit .
but when dr. larry davis ha asked about standardized test his immediate response is we do not have standardized child we do not come from standardized family we do not live in standardized environment .
how can standard aid is case and help these kid ?
and i fully agree with that .
but when you are looking at what lead to miscommunication and i think sandy hit it dead on when she said expectation and comfort zone is applicable .
people are not taught relativity .
because you think something is a certain way doesnt mean the person standing next to you think the same way .
everyone ha the to have an opinion .
the only thing that ha to be maintained is solid fact .
but the majority of what we have in the world is opinion .
certified or certainty about something is very difficult to prove .
what beer left with is the best or most applicable opinion but you have to be willing to be curious about the other person .
and you have to be willing to accept that because you have a value or belief about something it is not the best it is not optimal .
it is one of a million different way to look at that value or belief .
and you have to give anybody else their due to have a different opinion a different value a different belief .
now doe that create this harmony in term ?
absolutely but this harmony is how we evolve .
thats the one thing sandy said that i grew in meeting you up out of the mud .
she said that if we were all the same how boring would we be ?
we would be aesthetically boring .
i am going to tell you the teacher that i wa the most ingrained with wa an education teacher who taught english .
and back when i went to school when sandy went to school we were taught the classic .
you read mcbeth you read hamlet you read the classic .
but this teacher said no i got motorheads in the class .
if they want to bring popular mechanic to school and they want to do a report on the article from popular mechanic i am going to give them an a because it prof they know how to read comprehend and reframe and regurgitate the information .
and that taught me a valuable lesson very early in life that everyone is different .
everyone is unique everyone should have the ability to impress their teacher that they have a certain skill and it doesnt get taught in a standardized way .
thats important .
thats said .
and true half of my frustration in the classroom is because somebody else is telling me what i am supposed to say and i am not willing to do it .
and this ha yes i am a rebel .
but i want them to have an open opportunity to see multiple side of something .
and that and someone else that come along and say you need to do it .
and i do not know .
i want to say that it is first of all that i am appreciative that you brought sandy into this conversation .
it take decade decade to be comfortable speaking about some of the topic that sandy is a worldclass expert on the pain and anguish of having to lose a loved one out of no other reason than someone did not see something .
someone did not catch something .
when she talk about suicide and she talk about suicide prevention she always approach it from a practical position with empathy .
is there a reason why we can not apply that to other topic and other education sphere ?
even in the hard science when someone having difficulty learning something shouldnt we take the time to realize that maybe thats not their place where they need to be and we pivot them somewhere else and then give them credit for what they are good for it ?
thats what we need to do .
we can not people and say they can not do something because obviously everyone ha a skill set .
and i think i could never do what sandy doe at the level she doe .
she is fantastic about what she doe .
and likewise you can say that about anybody who an expert educated .
we are not teacher we are not educator .
we are learning environment facilitator .
they also have at least the equal education based on their learning .
and thats what people sandy bring to the table .
now let think what doe it think that wa striking me .
you were seeing that a i remember i wa in a biology class .
definitely not one of those conversation and that is in the science .
but there wa a there wa a gallon of class who wa having trouble taking note on suicide .
and if the if the teacher wa not looking at the class but wa stating on the board and talking at the same time she would have no way of knowing what he wa saying .
and we got into a conversation and she asked would i consider putting a carbon under my note taking and give her the copy of my raw note .
and i said yeah that would be great .
and then i saw her playing tennis .
and it wa my gosh it wa good .
i wa she wa a plus plus plus player .
i said i will take note and make sure that there is a legible a possible and try to capture let the professor saying .
and when you teach me some more about tennis .
and thats exactly what we did .
we had a nice little system of math .
and she beat up on the tennis court together .
and that and she made me a little bit of a better player at least .
and and i showed my note .
and it wa such a steel good .
it wa she did not have the opportunity unless someone helped her with hearing what wa going on in class .
and i did not have someone helping me be a little bit better on the tennis court .
sometimes they fall into our lap and we need to appreciate them .
listen this ha been another impact for night .
i think it is a relationship episode one and six thing .
listen i guess follow u . follow u . follow u . i heard .
i heard .
follow u . follow u . follow u . follow u . ive a podcast .
follow u . in fact the presentation on the show i guess .
face button .
i am a little bit scared of you .

eduverse pd podcast brought to you by proed education solution your onthego professional development .
welcome to the very first episode of the eduverse pd podcast .
in today episode our two ai cohosts andy and liz will explore the fascinating topic of nextgen learner .
theyll take a deep dive into an insightful article from eduverse newsletter fifteen titled adapting education for nextgen learner strategy and innovation written by dr. han gwin and dr. leigh dean baokwuk .
let jump in with andy and liz on how we can better prepare today student for tomorrow challenge .
hey everyone and welcome .
we are diving into the future of education today a topic that i think is fascinating .
have you heard the term nextgen learner ?
it is more than kid being good with tech .
we are talking about a generation whose brain are wired differently because of how they grew up immersed in this digital world .
yeah and it make you think about the term digital native ?
that came out back in two thousand and one .
and it is evolved much since then .
nextgen learner they are constantly connected .
they live and breathe the digital world .
and it change not what they learn but how they learn best .
it make you wonder how education can keep up .
it is a challenge for sure .
definitely ahead of the curve .
this is not about whats happening in classroom now .
the insight from this article written by dr. han gwin and dr. leigh dean baokwuk they can change how anyone think about learning .
and talk about realworld experience .
dr. nguyen cofounded an ai education company .
and dr. kwok with over twenty year in education founded proed education solution .
they are not theorizing here .
fullrate scholar ed tech ceo .
top voice in educational leadership even .
yeah theyve got the experience .
in this deep dive we are on a mission to uncover who these next gen learner are what make them tick and how education ha to adapt to meet their need .
think of it a a journey .
we are going to unravel the mystery of what make these learner unique .
and then well explore the exciting world of educational innovation that are designed for them .
and of course we are going to acknowledge the challenge ?
the uncharted territory that we are still navigating .
i love that analogy .
let start at the very beginning .
who are these next gen learner and what set them apart ?
to adapt to education we have to understand what make them tick .
one key difference is their relationship with technology .
you said it is not that they are good with tech .
it is that technology ha fundamentally changed how their brain work how they process information .
they are digital native in the truest sense of the word .
what else make them unique ?
one of the big thing is this real strong preference for personalized learning. . the old one size fit all approach it doesnt work .
they crave learning thats tailored to their need their interest and their pace .
that make sense ?
it is finally ditching those mass produced textbook in favor of something that is going to resonate with you .
how is education adapting to this need for personalization ?
this is where technology specifically ai is playing a huge role .
imagine a platform that adapts to a student learning in real time it can adjust the content the pace even the type of instruction based on their individual progress .
it is having a personal ai tutor .
thats incredible .
it is cool stuff .
but it is not about personalized learning ?
absolutely not .
another big one is their emphasis on collaboration and social learning .
they thrive in environment where they can learn from each other work together on project and connect with peer around the world .
learning from each other through platform even instagram or tiktok .
they are turning these platform into educational tool which is interesting to see .
it is .
it is a huge shift from that traditional individualistic approach to learning .
here something i find remarkable about this generation .
it is their awareness of global issue the sustainable development goal sdgs .
they are .
and it is amazing to see they are growing up with climate change social justice movement global interconnectedness all of it is their backdrop .
it is no wonder that they are passionate about making a difference .
but how doe this global awareness tie into their learning ?
it shape their worldview .
it motivates them to find solution to real world problem .
they are not learning about history .
they are thinking about how to shape the future. . and this focus on being .
we see that a lot with this generation .
it aligns with a lot of study that show the link between mental health and academic success .
of course .
it is all connected .
it is. . we have these digital native who thrive on personalized and collaborative learning .
and they are passionate about global issue .
it begs the question how do we a educator a a society create learning experience that resonate with them ?
yeah thats where thing get interesting .
let delve into some of these educational innovation that are being designed specifically for these nextgen learner .
we were talking earlier about nextgen learner being these digital natives. . and thats where this whole idea of technology integration come in .
it is key .
and we are not talking about swapping out chalkboard for interactive whiteboards .
think about learning management system. . lm .
lm got it .
which can streamline assignment feedback communication all in one digital space .
it is taking all the best part of the digital world and bringing them into the classroom in a way that make sense for how these student learn .
and it is interesting because this is not even a new concept .
our expert cite this two thousand and twelve study by west that emphasized the importance of integrating technology and education .
but whats exciting is how far weve come since then .
we are talking about a whole new level of sophistication personalization especially with ai .
which brings u back to dr. nguyens work with aipowered personalized learning path .
it is we are finally moving away from this onesizefitsall approach to education .
and personalized learning with ai allows u to tailor that educational experience .
to each student needs. . imagine a platform that can pinpoint when a student is struggling .
with a concept and automatically adjust the difficulty or provide additional support .
it is a personal tutor powered by ai .
thats wild .
it is cool stuff .
and it is not limited to individual learning ?
because we talked about how much nextgen learner value collaboration .
how doe that factor into these innovation ?
yeah thats a great question .
and it mean we need to think beyond the traditional classroom walls. . and create these opportunity for collaboration that feel natural. . engaging to this generation .
and thats where bringing in online community social learning platform can be effective .
it is interesting because these platform are already such a big part of their life .
it is meeting them where they are .
and it tap into their their desire to connect .
to learn from each other. . it is builtin .
it is .
and speaking of connecting it is inspiring how passionate these learner are about tackling realworld problem .
it is .
they are not learning about the issue .
they want to be part of the solution .
yeah they want to do something about it .
yes exactly .
and thats where something experiential learning come in. . we are talking handson projectbased learning that let them apply their knowledge to these real issue .
it is not hypothetical scenario .
this is digging into the real challenge .
think about project focused on climate change social justice even designing solution for their local community .
and the research back this up . . i studied by baron and darling hammond. . they found that projectbased learning led to greater engagement from student and better learning outcome .
yeah because it is learning by doing .
and it clearly works. . but it is not all about academic skill ?
these nextgen learner are going to need a very particular set of skill to navigate the future .
you are hitting on a important point because in a world thats changing rapidly we need to equip them with more than fact and figure .
of course .
they need resilience adaptability a growth mindset. . all of that to thrive in the face of uncertainty .
that make a lot of sense .
how can education help them develop those essential skill ?
i think it start with shifting our focus. . from rewarding the answer .
to encouraging experimentation embracing failure a a learning opportunity and fostering their emotional intelligence .
it is about giving them the tool to navigate not the academic world but the real world too .
it personalizes the pace the content keep them engaged and it go beyond that individual level ?
we are seeing amazing thing with projectbased learning where these student tackle realworld problem .
yeah we touched on that .
i think it deserves a closer look .
what make those project effective for these nextgen learner ?
it tap into their drive to make a difference ?
let them apply what they are learning to actual challenge .
even a group of student they are designing a community garden to address food insecurity or developing an app to promote sustainable living .
it is not theory it is real impact .
it is a realworld application .
yeah thats .
what other innovation are out there ?
get this gamification and virtual reality in education .
learning through vr that sound engaging .
it is .
stepping into a vr simulation of ancient rome or exploring the human body from the inside out it is immersive it is exciting .
it is turning education into a video game but with real learning goal .
and study show that gamification even in simpler form can boost engagement and motivation .
but it is not all hightech .
our expert also highlight soft skill emotional intelligence all that .
that make sense especially in a techdriven world you need those human skill .
communication collaboration empathy problemsolving these are essential ?
whats that ?
thats a term thats not at least competencybased education or cbe .
ive heard that term but to be honest i am not entirely sure what it mean .
break it down for me .
instead of moving through the material based on seat time or a set curriculum cbe let student progress by demonstrating what they know their mastery of specific skill .
it is le about grade more about actual understanding .
i can see how that would be motivating .
but with all these amazing innovation there must be challenge too ?
it can not all be easy .
whats the best way to do this ?
there a lot of great thing in cbe the tech the highspeed internet and the digital divide .
and thats what we do ?
we do the same thing with all these hurdle especially with something this big .
a major one is equity of access .
not every student ha the same access to tech highspeed internet which creates a digital divide .
thats a important point .
we can have the best intention amazing innovation but it ha to be accessible to everyone .
and we have to have the best potential development the resource to implement these innovation effectively .
and we can not forget about the potential downside of technology screen time the ethic of ai all of that .
finding that balance encouraging offline activity a healthy relationship with technology and with ai teaching these student to use these tool responsibly critically .
where do we go from here ?
whats the takeaway for our listener who are thinking how doe this apply to me to my kid ?
the future of learning it is full of possibility .
we have the tool the knowledge to create these amazing learning experience for nextgen learner but it take commitment adaptation a focus on equity and ethic .
it is not about the tech .
it is how we use it .
and speaking of using thing our expert left u with a great question .
they talked about teaching nextgen learner to think critically about ai .
but how do we do that ?
how do we make sure we are consuming information especially online with that critical eye ?
it is a question we should all be asking ourselves a technology becomes more and more intertwined with our life .
it is a journey of learning questioning adapting ?
it is .
and on that note a challenge to keep learning keep questioning keep exploring this everevolving world of education .
thanks for joining u on this deep dive into nextgen learner everyone .
until next time keep those mind open and those learning journey exciting .

download dialog track and listen to english conversation .
repeat the phrase that you hear out loud again and again .
review all the lesson on englishclass101.com to master them completely .
read line slowly at first then reread and increase your speed .
set small and measurable learning goal with your personal deadline .
try harder lesson to challenge yourself and improve faster .
and way to stop translating in your head .
identify object around you in english .
the first way to stop translating in your head is to identify the object around you in your target language .
if you are studying english that mean you look at the object around the room .
look at the thing in your life .
do not think of them in your native language first .
think of them in your target language first .
if i look around the room i see a computer .
i shouldnt think my native language word .
i should think my target language word .
start with the item and the situation in your everyday life .
if i say computer in english maybe i should say computer in japanese .
i should say not i do not know water in english .
start associating the word in your target language with your everyday life now .
if you are studying english that mean start getting familiar with the thing in your everyday life in english .
repeat phrase you hear native speaker use .
tip number two is to repeat the phrase that you hear native speaker use .
if you are watching this channel for example or you are watching a tv show or a movie listen for the way that native speaker make those phrase .
if you hear a phrase you have never heard before or you hear an interesting combination of word try to repeat them yourself .
do not listen try to save them yourself .
if you are in a public space and it is difficult for you to do that find practice in a place where you feel more comfortable .
maybe if you have some private space to practice repeat them .
get your mouth used to saying the word the way that the speaker the native speaker do .
if you never say word if you are only taking in if you are only listening and you are not producing the language it is hard to to practice and to hone your pronunciation to improve your pronunciation .
when you listen to native speaker try to repeat after them .
for example if you are studying english you can try to repeat after this video .
try to repeat after native speaker especially when you are looking at medium and you can do this when you are reading book too .
you can try to read out loud interesting line of book that you find or something that maybe is difficult for you .
very nice practice tip .
make a situation where you can not escape into your native language .
make a situation where you can not escape into your native language essentially mean immerse yourself .
of course going to that country or going to a place where you can speak only that language is very difficult for some of you .
you can not use the native language at all .
it force you to use the language that you are studying .
of course if you are lucky enough to live in the country or to live in a place where people speak the language you are studying great but you have to go out and interact with people .
you have to put yourself in a place where you have no choice but to speak .
it is very hard and it is very scary and it is very embarrassing at first .
but if you take time to find place and to make environment that are comfortable for you where you feel comfortable making mistake and asking question it is very valuable for your learning process .
this is something that i did .
my japanese wasnt very good for a long time but then i started making friend who could not speak english .
i did this through finding hobby .
there wa a hobby that i had .
i joined a group .
i joined a school to where i could learn how to do that hobby .
and everything wa taught only in japanese and the people in my class only spoke japanese mostly .
and then maybe we would go off for drink and food .
late at night or on the weekend and everybody spoke only japanese .
and if i couldnt communicate even simply in japanese i had no hope of keeping that friendship together .
it forced me to study .
it forced me to think about the word they were using and to try to learn those word those pattern a a how to produce them naturally myself .
i wa learning the vocabulary word .
the people around me were using and learning how to apply them on my own .
that wa only possible because i had no escape in those situation .
try to do that even if you can do it yourself in your house .
it is super helpful .
i think watch tv and movie in your target language without subtitle .
tip number four is to watch tv and movie in your target language without subtitle .
without subtitle .
i think that watching with subtitle can be very beneficial .
if i am watching something or if you want to watch something with subtitle on great .
but i sometimes find that i can in my case i think too much about reading the subtitle and i forget to listen .
maybe if youve seen a movie in your target language a few time with the subtitle on try turning the subtitle off .
play around with it a little bit .
if there a word thats difficult for you to hear you can turn on the subtitle in the native language of the movie a . thats something that ive done .
if i wanted to study japanese it is very useful when the actual word spoken in japanese appear on the screen .
sometimes it is easier for me to catch a word if i see it visually and i hear it at the same time .
another way to explore how you can use tv and movie is to turn on the closed caption the the the word on the screen in the native language of the movie .
this is two point in one .
one watch movie without subtitle meaning subtitle in your native language .
and hint two is to watch movie with closed captioning on but the closed captioning is in your target language not in your native language .
you can try those two thing with tv and with movie .
do not bring a dictionary to your lesson .
tip number five is do not bring a dictionary to your lesson .
give me a second here .
i understand the dictionary .
it wa especially electronic dictionary .
we have them on our phone now are very very convenient .
of course it is important to use them and it is a great resource to have .
however one thing that bother me and that i think is detrimental .
it is not helpful for student is when student are in a lesson and they are practicing conversation and they reach a point in the conversation where they do not know the word they want to use .
they know it in their native language and they do not know how to say it in their target language .
they pull out their dictionary .
they say to the person listening to them their practice partner in their lesson where they have a limited period of time a moment .
and then they look it up on their phone .
it take a few second the flow of the conversation stop and then they say a word .
it is whoa no thats not you do not have that ability .
you do not have the ability to do that in a conversation with a native speaker .
most people if you go to a bank and try to open a bank account are you going to pull out your dictionary and sit there and try to communicate a moment a moment .
a you look up each word you do not know .
no or if you do thats not a real conversation .
instead try using a different strategy .
by that if you find a word you do not know in conversation explain the word to your conversation partner .
maybe they know the word .
if you are speaking with a native speaker this is a chance for them to teach you a word .
i find that when people take the time to teach me a word i remember the word much better than looking it up on my dictionary .
try to resist .
maybe you can bring a dictionary to your lesson but do not use it or try not to use it in your conversation practice .
it is it destroys the flow of a conversation .
instead practice the skill of describing the vocabulary word you want to use and learn how to ask the meaning of a word or learn how to ask for a vocabulary word from your partner .
you can use an expression whats the word that mean ?
puppabla or it is this thing that doe this and this and this .
this is an opportunity for you to describe characteristic of something or find a different way .
you can use whatever you have a lot of tool but try not to use a dictionary in a conversation because it is not realistic .
number six is a quick one .
i think number six hint number six i have is to train response to common question .
for example a very common question in english is hey how are you ?
you should know how to answer this question .
hey how are you ?
if it take you a long time to answer the question hey how are you ?
you need to practice .
i think thats a pretty good a pretty good indicator .
for example sometimes i ask student a question that they havent quite gotten the idea of how to respond yet .
they they they are not quick at responding .
and they say yes .
and then they think and they go i am i am a good .
thats a very common question .
think about a default response that you can spit out that you can quickly say .
if it is how is your weekend or hey whats up ?
or what do you want to do for dinner tonight ?
think about a handful meaning a few response to those question and train them quickly .
how are you ?
there three .
it is training response to those question .
there no reason to be surprised by a question how are you ?
for those common question train response .
that weve got a bunch of video especially beginner level video for some example response you can do .
do not get stuck with these little question .
train a few response .
practice a few response till they feel natural to you .
itll save you time and itll help the person asking the question to move forward in the conversation .
hey study with material that do not provide a translation .
the next tip is to study with material that do not provide a translation .
by this if you are using worksheet or some textbook or whatever and it ha your target language the language you are studying and it ha your native language next to it .
while this can be useful i feel that if you can studying your material only in your target language and then simplify explanation for more detailed point .
also in your target language can be a little bit better .
i do not want to say you should only study thing in your target language and nothing from your native language because of course it can be helpful sometimes to look up a word or to understand a grammar point in your native language .
but where possible if you can find something that provides simplified explanation in your target language it can be helpful .
because again you are thinking you are learning to think on a simpler and a more basic level about the language you are studying in the language that you are studying .
this can be good .
finding some material to use where there no translation .
maybe you can practice of course with with book and with written material but also with video material a . there are a variety of different way that you can find material in your target language in video and tv .
some thing to think about there are the level of vocabulary word people are using in the medium content you are watching .
who the medium content is intended for ?
child young adult adult the speed at which the speaker is talking .
i have the ability to change the level of difficulty of video based on the rate of speech the vocabulary word that i use and how many idiom and thing i use .
i could make a video very difficult .
we could make a a very difficult video series by leveling up our vocabulary .
by speaking very quickly or a you might see in our english in threeminute series we can also use very simple vocabulary and speak it a low rate of speech .
maybe now this is a very intermediate level video .
please think about that .
not for written material but also for your audio and visual material .
think about who your audience is the level of the material and on .
it can be fun and it can be helpful to think about your target language in your target language .
all we are almost done .
study phrase in addition to single vocabulary .
the next tip is study phrase in addition to single vocabulary word .
yes of course vocabulary is important but i find it personally very very useful to look at how a vocabulary word is used in a phrase because sometimes using it in a phrase help you understand the nuance of that vocabulary word .
if i a word crazy for example in english depending on the situation where the word crazy is used it could mean something different .
it could mean a person who is mentally confused or mixed up .
it could also mean something good .
it could mean something bad .
if we look only at the word crazy it is quite difficult to understand the meaning of the word but if you look at the way the word is used in a phrase you can get a lot more information .
take a look at the way people use word in phrase not a single vocabulary word .
you can learn a lot more that way i think .
do your daily activity in english ?
where possible ?
the next step is to do your daily activity in your target language .
if you are studying english that mean try to do some daily activity in english if possible .
this can be very very boring stuff but think about it when you are doing the activity .
now i am filming a video for englishclass101.com or i am going to work .
i am cooking breakfast .
i am doing the laundry .
what do i have to do tomorrow ?
try thinking about your everyday life in english if you are studying english .
try thinking about your everyday activity that people that you meet .
what are you doing ?
this is a way to help you practice your verb .
if you do not know if you are i do not know you are doing something at work and you are my gosh how do i explain the whats the verb for a picture ?
i want to bubble up a picture .
whats the word ?
you can check a dictionary at that point and go it is draw .
i need to use the verb draw for draw a picture .
you can find these little gap in your everyday life .
these little gap in your knowledge .
if you think about your everyday activity in your target language if you do not think about it in your target language you might not realize you have vocabulary gap or phrase gap here and there .
this is a good and funny way to study .
use a learner dictionary for new word .
the last tip is to use a learner dictionary for new word .
in english there are learner dictionary available in english .
my favorite my personal favorite is maryam webster .
maryam webster is a fantastic dictionary resource .
they are interesting and they have ton of historical information .
i do sit and read thing on the dictionary page lately .
it is true .
but of course there a definition .
there a meaning for word .
there are example sentence for word .
but maryam webster also ha whats called a learner dictionary .
if you find a word that you do not recognize you can check it in a dictionary in a learner dictionary and it give you a simplified a simple explanation in simple english of that word .
instead of checking it in your native language you can check it in your target language .
again this help you to understand the word that you are that you are focused on .
but you understand it from the language you are studying not from your native language .
using a learner dictionary can be useful a . all ten way to report speech .
the first word is say say a a verb .
say is a very neutral word .
you can use to report someone speech to explain something someone said in the past .
for example he said the barbecue wa canceled which is a simple neutral report .
the next verb is tell .
tell is used when one person is giving information to another to tell someone something they did not know before .
do not say tell me your phone number .
thats weird .
but can you tell me where the station is ?
can you tell me where to buy a hamburger ?
can you tell me where to pick up my new car ?
giving someone information they do not know or on the other hand explaining something one way to another person .
do not tell me what i can not do is a very good lost reference if youve ever watched lost .
tell another example sentence my bos told me i wa doing a good job .
the next one is speak .
when we are talking about language ability i speak english i speak japanese .
we can use speak in the past tense to report something .
but it usually sound a little more formal .
i spoke to my bos about or i spoke to my parent about or i spoke to my boyfriend or girlfriend about blah blah blah .
that using speak instead of talked make it sound a little bit more formal .
you can use speak but it is going to sound polite .
in his sentence my colleague spoke with me about an upcoming project .
wa the next one the next two are very very casual expression .
when you are speaking with friend and you are talking about a quick maybe somewhat emotional conversation you will hear native speaker especially american perhaps this is unique somewhat to american .
use the phrase wa i wa he wa she wa this is a very casual way to report speech .
and youll hear it often very very quickly together .
someone will say i wa what ?
and then she wa no and then i wa yeah thats the pattern youll hear it in very very quick way to report speech but the subject change .
i wa he wa she wa we were this is a way to share what happens quickly .
instead of i said he said she said which might sound a little too formal we can use i wa he wa to do that instead .
this is a fun one .
and if you can use this naturally i think that itll help you sound more natural too .
in his sentence and then he wa i love that movie .
wa all the next one is also a similar to wa we have the expression wa all .
it wa all do not worry about all all doe not have the meaning of the whole of something or a complete something .
instead wa all this set phrase is used to report speech .
usually this one is used when there some emotional emotional aspect to your conversation .
or it is a little dramatic or maybe a little exciting .
we use it the same way a wa in that very very quick style of speaking .
and then he wa and i wa all and then she wa and i wa all we use those together .
but i wa all ha a little more emphasis .
i feel i tend to use it when my when i want to express a stronger emotion .
and i wa all no way or i wa all what ?
you can use it for those very surprised emotion or maybe angry emotion wa and wa all are both used in very casual situation .
in a sentence and i wa all my god me too .
the next word is talk .
talk similar to say is a fairly neutral verb when reporting speech .
youll use it in a situation where someone is giving new information to you .
but maybe it is a two way conversation .
for example we talked about blah blah blah for a topic or my bos talked to me about blah blah blah .
maybe new information is being exchanged but the conversation is two way .
there are multiple participant .
with tell it is the nuance is one person is reporting information giving information with talk to there an exchange happening there .
keep in mind when you use the word talk you will say either i talked to or i talked with someone and then youll usually have a topic .
i talked to my friend about my new apartment .
i talked to my bos about array .
i talked to my bos .
no i talked to my dog about what dog do .
there some there some exchange happening there .
youll need to use two or with when you are referring to the person or entity you are talking to and youll use about to refer to the subject .
you can use this one yeah when you want to discus exchange of information .
in a sentence she talked to me about my family .
let go to the next one .
the next one is mentioned .
thats thats when we use the verb mentioned .
we can also use it in a statement please mention any skill you have on a resume .
it is the nuance is a a little bit of information is when we use mentioned .
in a sentence our manager mentioned upcoming change at the company to go on and on .
the next expression is to go on and on .
to go on and on mean to talk for a very long time .
maybe have a coworker or a friend or family member that talk and doe not stop talking .
we say to go on and on thats the expression we use .
in a sentence the speaker at the seminar wa going on and on about the topic .
if you want to emphasize it you can say i wa going on and on and on and on and on and on not emphasizes that the person continues to speak .
if somebody who doe that a lot you can use this expression to talk about them .
according to the next expression here is according to according to is used in the news or to officially report something .
according to source or according to the police according to the government official according to my teacher according to my mother these are direct report of information and their direct report of information from a specific source .
according to the newspaper my neighborhood ha fiftyzero amazing ramen shop .
thats not true .
but if i want to instead of saying my neighborhood ha fiftyzero amazing ramen shop i am giving a source for that .
according to my newspaper this is where i got the information .
this is important to use in news in newspaper in any official documentation you will see and hear according to these case .
in a sentence according to a witness at the scene the suspect escaped report .
the next one is report .
report similar to according to we use report in more official situation .
to officially share information to report to the police to report to your teacher to report to your bos .
sometimes it mean to submit documentation to give someone a written report .
sometimes it is to share information officially with your voice to report news or to report an update .
when you want to give an official information well use the verb report .
in a sentence source in the area report that the accident wa not serious .

welcome everybody to this panel on lorewen and education .
i am joined by remco al and mark .
should we start with some introduction maybe ?
i run a small business called fingertude in the uk .
and i guess my involvement with education is being around teaching lorewen and the principle of iot to primary school secondary school and university .
is that enough of an introduction ?
we are primarily distributor of iot hardware and device and a lot of lorewen .
we are based in edinburgh in the uk and also now in the netherlands .
and we work quite closely with the university of edinburgh and they have many project in education .
thats been an interesting world to get into .
i am the chairman of iot aplodoren .
that is the association that came out of the tt and aplodoren community .
and i am teaching still at the university of applied science where i am working with a program of embedded system engineering .
and ive got thirty year of experience in telecommunication .
sound good .
welcome everybody .
i am ben oleyenka and i do technical content for the thing industry .
that mean a lot of writing about how to use lorewen product and then also trying to create awareness about lorewen a a solution .
the first question is how do lorewen being used in education ?
my involvement ha been most of my customer are local government in the uk .
and they are keen to engage with local community particularly around thing lorewen .
and in the uk the teaching of technology is probably not a it should be in the school .
they often look for outside support .
in south wale i have been working with comarthenshire council doing a fun twosession runthrough of iot with nineyearolds .
this is originally teaching them about sensor and radio and then deploying a load of sensor in the school and then coming back six week later and doing a session all on the data that we have gathered from that and talking about thing data security and stuff that .
ive been doing workshop with secondary education in a technical college .
and i hire student a . seventeen eighteenyearold student i will hire them for project over the summer they get some real work experience .
and then i guess the third bit would be working with university .
we developed a personal safety solution for reading university developed with student at the university that ha since been taken on and it is now a safety application for the whole town of reading .
anyone who life there can make use of that .
yeah i think that should cover it .
ive been working with the university of edinburgh quite a lot .
they had some funding .
they have a reasonable amount of money to spend in iot device and solution .
and it is got to be focused in our area of the country which is the southeast of scotland .
this money is to be spent in benefiting the people and the environment and all these thing .
one of the thing they wanted to focus on is education more about data than about the technology itself .
they see that there a real gap in education in the uk especially when it come to data .
and the next generation is going to have to be able to analyze data and understand it better and more automatically .
and thats not being taught very .
their project is to put co2 sensor loroam co2 sensor and gateway into every school in the region which is five hundred and fifty school .
weve deployed about half now .
and theyve built an educational program around those that they are delivering through the teacher .
they are educating the educator how to teach these kid about data science .
and the kid in school have now got real world data to look at .
they move the sensor around and they see what happens .
they leave them in their room and they see the level go up .
they open the window .
they see them come down .
in this case the loroam is an interesting component of it but it is not the key thing .
it is more about the data and understanding what it mean and getting the reason and the understanding there .
thats the key thing there .
and our part of this project ha been helping with the delivery of it .
obviously there a lot of gateway to get out .
there a lot of sensor to get out and configuring all this stuff and getting all delivered to all these different school and dealing with all these different educational authority .
it is a big logistical thing .
but we went into one of the school and it wa fun .
they had some kid that were last year at primary school which i think is ten eleven that age .
and they had there wa these four girl that had been first to test this stuff out .
and they were keen and interested .
and they were this is cool .
and then we brought in some other sensor for them to look at .
and they are all what doe this one do ?
what doe this one do ?
what doe this one do ?
and they wanted to know everything .
they were soaking it up .
that wa cool .
they are now looking at expanding this project and seeing what else they can put out .
weather station .
and they can detect rainfall and particulate in the air and all that .
and they can find out more about their environment .
yeah i am using lora one in my program in my class .
and for me in the class lora one is a vehicle .
lora one a we all know is not fit for all purpose .
a for every purpose there a different protocol or whatever that you need to apply .
and lora one is a vehicle for me to teach my student in seven week the magic that come with designing iot device defining iot solution in there .
because engineering an iot solution is a fivedimensional chess play a chess that youve got .
on one hand youve got power low power budget from the battery low power youve got coverage youve got data rate youve got latency youve got whatever the data come through yes or no .
all thing that if you design an iot solution and thats what i am teaching my student lora one is capable of offering you that .
and the fun thing about lora one is that it is a modern standard it is a relative recent standard although two thousand and sixteen two thousand and seventeen there still a reason .
it is secure by design it is with low power in mind .
and whats very nice about lora one standard in my course is that it is a standard it is only this thick .
you can read it in an evening not necessarily .
it is not a fun evening is it ?
but you can read it in an evening and then you do not understand everything but you can start with it .
if you go for a modern standard narrowband or ltcadema or whatever i do not know whether the stack of paper fit here from the floor up to the ceiling and i can deal with that in seven week .
lora one is for me a vehicle that i use to have use case they come with a use case and they have to implement it .
and they have to think also about it whether lora one is the technology of choice .
and of course ive decided to use lora one you get an indoor gateway from me you get a nice device to prototype on but you may challenge me in my class and say youve chosen lora one you should have chosen narrowband .
and then i say good idea .
come up with a reasoning .
and there are not many strand of technology where you can understand the whole endtoend piece relatively quickly a a student it is something you can pick up and feel youve got a good grip on it .
every piece that is in the chain from the node from the sensor up to the presentation in there youll find it everywhere in every other technology in every use case again .
maybe a bit differently implemented but the foundation is the same everywhere .
it is a chain and thats the nice thing about lora one .
and you can run it all yourself you can do every part yourself you are not reliant on an operator .
and it is what also is very nice is and thats also very important in modern education depending on the need the interest of the student you can divert within the range of lora one he more interested in low power then you dig into low power .
he want to know about the back end here tt here chirpsack whats that ?
youve got a server implemented do it yourself and come up with the result .
and then all these individual initiative they are all brought together into the same project which work in the end .
that sound a interesting variety of example there .
do you get your student to read the lora one standard ?
and what fun is i start with a presentation on lora one and then there are a couple of video which unfortunately are v2 video then i always have to translate yeah you prefer that one but nevertheless and then after three week they all get a challenge .
do thing foundation training and the exam on here and seventy five of them take the exam and get the badge .
and thats also quite interesting because then they have also the element of competition in there .
yes they go in there and i have weekly i have question i challenge them and i come up with i confront them in their engineering decision with the standard say this how do you address that ?
and then weve got a very interesting discussion with you guy .
i wrote some of those question and i havent read the lora one standard in it entirety i do not think that .
youve got some homework now then .
yeah yeah thats tonight .
if you have trouble sleeping read the whole thing .
on the train maybe .
sure is a disadvantage about the lora one standard .
you can still sleep in it when you put it on your pillow and it is heavy on your head when you start sleeping .
i think that you guy touched on this a little bit but why do you think it is important to use lora one or maybe even other type of iot in education ?
one thing that you said made me immediately think about the gender gap in stem .
you mentioned that you have a group of girl who are excited about the census .
that wa a funny one .
this wa one of the first school that they deployed this in a a test case .
we went over to see them and chat about it and i did a little talk about my bit of the world and stuff .
but apparently they asked the class to put their hand up if they were interested in joining and doing this stuff first .
and it wa these four girl that went they went straight into it .
and they ran with it .
now and what wa interesting is these girl who are ten or eleven are now dragging in all of their classmate and this is cool .
and then everybody else is looking over their shoulder and going yeah they did not .
thats great thats interesting .
thats better than stuff on a whiteboard .
that work .
theyve added theyve become cheerleader for the whole thing and getting people involved .
and thats good .
but rolling it out across all the school obviously youve got a nominal fiftyfifty mix of gender and school .
youve got all those kid there youve got a captive audience to talk to .
every kid of that age in our region of scotland is going to be learning about this stuff .
it is not that it is not going to be a divided thing .
you are all going to get a look at it or get a chance to play with it and thats how it should be .
hopefully a a father of a daughter i am hoping that this gender gap will close and well see how it go .
but i think this is a good start .
i think whats very important is about loroana is that it is accessible .
and with that you have more youngster kid coming in being able to start with it .
and they have very rapidly they have the experience of success .
and when the experience of success is there then the fun come in and all these thing facilitate in the learning .
and i think loroana a a protocol if it a not a a mean but a something that you can use in what you want to obtain then that is very much supportive on that one .
i suppose that you are saying that obviously you can do that the whole piece .
you can do the whole thing from end to end .
but you can also quite easily skip large section of it .
you can hide the difficult bit and say here your sensor .
let not worry about the network server bit .
that work let say on some dashboard .
you can start with a nice overview and work down .
when i did an engineering degree my lecturer called it a process of diminishing deception .
then first year everythings cool everythings easy .
look at this shiny stuff .
and then in next year it is remember i said that wa easy .
peel back a layer .
and then by the end of the time you wanted to kill yourself because you are now down at the atom .
yeah you simply level up .
but it is a way you can start at the top and work your way down nicely can not you ?
yeah i hired tracy who had finished her alevels .
she hadnt done a a she wanted .
she wa going to resit them that she could go to university .
she came to work for me for a year .
she came up with the idea for the personal safety app .
and we pitched that to the council together .
and she got one hundredzero worth of funding which a someone who is shes nineteen at the time thats a real endorsement for your idea .
and thats through learning a bit about laura wan and what potential it had .
and then going on to deliver it wa it is been a real growth for her .
she went back absolutely aced the alevel .
shes done a degree a master shes doing a phd now still involved in technology which a you said at the beginning the gender gap is a real problem .
and this is one way or one example of someone who beaten that and doing in it .
... thats a inspiring story .
i think with laura wan and iot you are able to plant a seed in these youngster where they are sensible or sensitive to technology .
and this piece of interest is growing in there .
and at some moment it can take short or long time it blossom and then they are capable of doing some nice thing much nicer thing than we have done far with iot with laura wan for example .
what would you say is unique about using laura wan in education ?
the diversity .
i think for u it is the variety of thing you can do with it .
the different application different sensor .
many different sensor that we are not teaching the protocol but we are teaching how to use these thing .
and it is you can get weather station pest control you can have the environmental thing being monitored you can do soil sensor all sort of stuff .
and i guess we do quite a lot in higherlevel education a and research .
when you go up the stack youve got a lot of research going on and there people here doing all these thing research project and they want a sensor for this and a sensor for that .
and laura wan doe all of this stuff now you can always find the device for them .
and then that enables their research to happen that much more easily .
the variety of use case allows you to make them wonder .
they come up with a sensor with an ultrasound height meter and then they go what do i use this for ?
and then you come up within the context of global warming or for example the flood network which is in the uk .
and it work the other way around a where they can come to you and say we want to measure this .
and you go yeah i have a thing for that .
and not necessarily the thing you thought of but we know how to do that .
we can always find something .
we had a reverse due cash project in there where they had to do all kind of thing and there wa one guy that came up yeah i wanted to do some communication with the box. . consider laura wan .
and there are some limitation which you ran in rapidly into and you had to address it .
we have very much a learning experience on that one .
yeah thats all possible .
i think there something great if youve got laura wan in a town a because you can take the stuff outside of the school system .
marcos project with the junior iot challenge is absolutely fantastic .
and if you havent seen it it is worth going to talk to .
but this idea that you can start with something in school and you can think about how you might apply it to your own home or your garden or kid love the idea of being able to see where their pet cat is gone in the garden .
and thats something you can realize .
they can do that .
and i think that mean that they are thinking about it more than in the lesson time .
al you also mentioned that you can conceal complicated part of the system and then later make them simple .
and i think laura wan is interesting in that you can you can run a gateway and explain how to set that up and what it doe .
and then you can go outside and use a gateway thats managed by somebody else .
you have both of these aspect where you are plugging into a system that is bigger than you but then also you are able to relatively quickly set that up and understand it .
yeah and there many resource online a for learning .
kid are brilliant at finding the howto video .
better research is on the web than we are .
but we also the tti video .
you make some nice video that make thing easy and understandable .
but we johanns video which is wa it laura wan in an hour or thirty minute or something crazy ?
it go from end to end .
and whenever weve got a new person that we are saying here a video cover everything .
sit down have a cup of coffee .
and it start out easy .
it is youve got gateway and device .
and it is bang spreading factor bang adr .
it get all the detail .
but you can yeah the whole thing can be done in an hour .
and you sit and concentrate .
when we have new people starting saying we can we can onboard them quite quickly into the laura wan world with a few of these video and get them going .
and they understand a whole lot of it .
i remember watching that the first time and not understanding anything .
yeah you have to watch a few time .
you have to watch a few time and then use stuff .
each time yeah .
and it is the handson aspect that then make those thing that are already in your brain sit i think .
where do the future of laura wan in education or in iot in education and stem in education ?
i see the future in a much a birmingham city university dr. adela neba .
he wa here in i think two thousand and seventeen two thousand and eighteen and then started teaching laura wan in his bachelor degree with student back then .
i am now working with people whove been through that program now at research level still at the university putting project together that involve using laura wan to do other research .
and i think thats exciting .
and i guess at the much younger end in wale again i wa one of the school wa in a town and the kid there had done this a couple of week earlier .
theyd been running business virtual business at school .
and they were interested in how you could apply laura when wed been through the workshop i wa doing with them how you could apply that to their business and manage they were talking about football going in and out the shop could you tell this ?
and this is a nineyearold kid and i think thats brilliant .
and then i wa at another school which is much more rural .
all the kid come from farming background and their ability to decrypt encoded message .
i would write something up in encoded on the board .
and by the time id finished writing they would be there going i know what that is .
and i think it is very exciting .
if we can get these skill into people young enough and the interest and enthusiasm that come with it then hopefully that carry through .
yeah i think for me the scale now now that we are seeing much bigger rollout of stuff we are finally with the seton reunion project we are rolling out to all of the school .
it is taken a long time to get all the council and education authority to agree to get these device into their school which we now have much more agreement this project is going faster getting them out there .
well be covering thousand and thousand of kid which is great .
but also youve got now much bigger deployment of sensor environmental sensor which mean youve got much more data to work with .
now there a whole other bunch of research and another education avenue that open up based on the data thats being captured at much bigger scale .
and i think thats interesting from teaching kid about data and how to use that .
thats interesting .
when we deployed the sensor in the primary school i thought maybe this is an in with the facility side of thing on the school .
and i think thats you are absolutely .
these new data stream are going to provide a lot of raw material .
i think laura won we can all say laura won is here to stay .
a couple of year or we were in doubt but now we know for sure laura won is here to stay .
and i think with the change that we see in society and in climate and everything too and all the ability that weve got machine learning grew .
the vehicle the train is still there .
the only thing is that at some point we are going to do some thing differently .
before we talked about edge computing now it is called machine learning which we still move to the edge .
and we are going to do these thing more and more practically .
we are still going to work with laura won with this chain of information in there .
and we are going to enhance part in that and study more on that and find new opportunity on that one on this chain ai displaying addressing big issue or big challenge that weve got in these society in our society .
yeah i think it is only enabling u to grow further on that one .
thats the way i will look at it .
i saw a presentation from edge impulse about using ai to generate data set that you do not have to do any work to collect .
and i thought that wa interesting .
i hope we do not lose kid with clipboard .
they are doing little tally .
counting car and yeah .
yeah i imagine everyones done that .
nowadays you use sensor network .
you can automate that .
my last question is what is your most inspirational story from having used loronn in education ?
the fact that a student come to me sir or it wa an acn student professor i wa in your class and now i am in a project i am doing these thing on that one .
it is the best reward you could get .
they come up youve planted the seed they carry it along with them and at some moment it come out of the basket and hey i am going to use these ive got a purpose for that and then you are successful .
thats the feeling that i get .
youll be good at that .
yeah yeah thats fine .
you can give a few example .
you can give a few example .
i think i am going to be grateful for whatever she produce .
but there are ... ive got a guy who ... he worked with me for a few week over the summer .
i do not think i had very much to do with this at all .
he spent the whole time arguing with me about what programming language we should use and then he did a great job .
we were doing a digital playground for an agricultural college in northwest wale .
and he helped write that and he wa absolutely brilliant .
but he went on ... he decided not to go to university .
he got a job with a startup in london .
it is probably worth more than all of u now .
and then there are others who went from me to cisco and have been getting promoted through there .
another guy who become a real data whiz .
most of them go to university and then into technology .
it sound special .
what programming language wa he ... what wa the answer ?
i wa ... let see at the time ... on that project it wa node.js and javascript .
and he wa strongly advocating rust .
he wa way ahead of his time .
and interfunctional programming .
and that wa the ... he went to work for a company that wa using rust .
and yeah i do not think he ever looked back .
any other closing word ?
thank you for having u . thanks much .
thank you remco .
thank you al .
thank you for sharing the passion that you have in education .
it wa fun to be here .
good to have soulmates here on this day .
on this day on this discussion .
this is also the last session on this stage .
we can say goodbye to everybody .
thank you .
