this is a podcast from techandainews.com .
for more information visit our website .
you want to know what all the fuss is about with this stable diffusion three.five update ?
yeah everyones saying it is changing ai image generation but is it all hype ?
or is there something there ?
let me tell you there definitely substance behind the excitement .
this is not a minor tweak .
we are talking about a major overhaul .
yeah you could say that .
whats interesting is that stability ai did not release one new model .
they gave u a couple of different version stable diffusion three.five and large turtle .
it is not a one size fit all situation anymore .
it is more theyve given u a specialized set of tool .
we can choose which one is best depending on what we are working on .
it is a toolbox then .
yeah i picked the tool for the job .
let talk about those two version then .
large and large turbo .
whats the difference ?
think of it this way .
if speed is everything you need to quickly generate a bunch of different concept maybe for a client ?
then large turbo is your go to .
because it is all about speed churning out those image super fast .
for someone i do not know a graphic designer with a tight deadline .
you could mock up a whole website banner in minute trying out different idea and composition without waiting forever for those image to render .
i can definitely see how that would be a game changer for a lot of people .
but what about those project that need more detail more finesse ?
where you need to control every aspect of the image. . and thats where stable diffusion three.five large come in .
it is more of a balance between speed and quality. . still significantly faster than the older version .
but you get more control over the final result .
imagine you are creating a super detailed illustration maybe for a childrens book ?
large would let you carefully craft each element make sure the image is exactly how you want it .
it is almost large turbo is having a fast sketch artist .
and then large is working with a master painter who taking their time to get all those detail .
that is a great analogy .
and the best part is you get to choose which approach work best for what you need .
thats fantastic .
but then on top of all that there the whole open source aspect of this release ?
thats going to be pretty huge for the community .
it is a game changer no doubt .
by making stable diffusion three.five open source stability .
ai ha invited everyone to participate in the development and evolution of this technology .
it is not about using these tool .
it is about contributing to them a . exactly .
now developer can build their own custom tool and plugins for stable diffusion .
artist can share their own unique workflow and technique .
and researcher they can dive deep into that code and explore new possibility .
i can see how that open collaboration would lead to faster innovation and much richer creative ecosystem .
yeah absolutely .
instead of a single company driving the development weve got this global community ?
all these passionate people pushing those boundary of whats possible .
it is think of the early day of the internet .
when all that information became freely accessible it led to an explosion of creativity and innovation .
i see where you are going with this .
this could shake thing up not for artist and developer but for anyone who us image in their work .
and this is the beginning a more people get their hand on stable diffusion three.five we are going to see even more creative and innovative application popping up everywhere .
this is exciting stuff .
it is a very interesting time to be part of ai image generation .
it feel we are on the verge of something truly transformative .
but before we get too ahead of ourselves i think we should dive a little deeper into some of the specific of this release .
you mentioned how open source is going to allow developer to build custom tool .
what tool are we talking about ?
what are the possibility ?
thats a great question .
let start with something called a control net. . control net .
ive heard that term but i am not entirely sure what it is .
how doe it work with stable diffusion three.five ?
think of control net a a way to give stable diffusion more guidance more direction when it is generating an image .
you are essentially giving it extra information to help it understand the structure and composition that you want .
it is giving the ai a set of blueprint .
thats a great analogy .
and with stable diffusion three.five those capability have been significantly enhanced. . there a wider variety of control net model now each designed to help you achieve different creative effect .
what effect ?
imagine you want to generate an image of a person in a specific pose ?
with control net you could provide stable diffusion with a simple sketch of that pose and itll use that to generate an image that match what you had in mind .
i could sketch a stick figure doing a handstand and stable diffusion would create a realistic image of a person in that exact pose .
and it is not pose .
you can use control net to guide everything from the overall composition of the image to the style and texture of the element within it .
that sound incredibly powerful .
are there any limit to what you can do with this ?
the possibility are id say pretty vast .
and with stable diffusion three.five being open source we can expect those developer to push those boundary even further .
we are already seeing some creative application of control net from generating image that match specific lighting scheme to illustration that mimic the style of famous artist .
it sound control net is opening up a whole new world for artist and anyone who want to create unique imagery .
but i have to admit i am still wrapping my head around how this all work .
can you break down the technical side a little bit ?
how doe control net interact with stable diffusion ?
at it core stable diffusion is a neural network thats been trained on a massive data set of image ?
when you give it a text prompt it us that to generate a new image that match your description .
control net add another layer of information on top of that text prompt .
it is saying here the general idea but stay within these line .
and those line can be anything from a symbol sketch to a complex 3d model .
control net is essentially giving the ai a more detailed roadmap making sure that the final image is more aligned with your vision .
and with stable diffusion three.five the way control net interacts with that neural network ha been refined and improved .
this is all fascinating stuff .
but i have a feeling we are scratching the surface here .
there got to be more to this update ?
you are absolutely .
we havent even touched on some of the other key feature of stable diffusion three.five the improvement to image quality and all the new safety feature .
it sound weve got a lot more to discus .
there a whole world of creative possibility to explore .
i am already looking forward to it .
a am i. picking up where we left off let talk about image quality .
it is one thing to have ai that can make image quickly but those image have to be good too .
something youd use for a real project. . yeah .
speed without quality .
it is i do not know having a fancy sport car with no engine .
might look impressive but it is not going to get you very far .
and thats one of the area where stable diffusion three.five shine i think .
they made some significant improvement to the core algorithm .
the image you get are better sharper more detailed more realistic than ever before .
we are not talking about making image faster .
we are talking about better image period .
absolutely. . whats changed ?
how do they do it ?
one of the key improvement is in something called coherency .
not sure i am familiar with that term .
what doe that mean exactly ?
we are talking about ai image generation .
sure it mean the image make sense .
the different part of the image are arranged logically .
there consistency to the overall aesthetic .
in the earlier version of stable diffusion you might have gotten image where i do not know thing looked a bit off .
jumbled or disjointed a dog with three leg or a house with a window floating in midair .
but those kind of error are way le common with stable diffusion three.five .
the ai understands those relationship between object better .
thats got to be huge especially if you are using ai for something graphic design or illustration .
you need those image to look professional and polished .
you can not have say a website banner with weird perspective or a childrens book illustration where the character are all distorted .
these improvement to coherency they are bridging that gap between ai generated image and what a human would create .
and it is a trend we are seeing in ai image generation in general .
it is getting harder and harder to tell the difference between what a human made and what came from a machine .
that doe raise all sort of interesting question but i think well save those for another time .
for now though i do want to talk about the safety feature in stable diffusion three.five .
this ha been a hot topic in the ai community and it is good to see stability ai taking it .
yeah for sure .
ai is powerful and we need to use it responsibly. . with stable diffusion three.five there a big emphasis on preventing harmful or inappropriate content from being generated .
you are saying theyve built in safeguard to stop people from using it to create thing that could be offensive or dangerous .
the algorithm are trained now to recognize and flag certain kind of imagery .
and there are system in place to prevent those image from even being made in the first place .
what imagery are they trying to block ?
thing hate speech violence sexually explicit content .
those are all thing stable diffusion three.five is designed to avoid .
it is about making sure this technology is used for good not to cause harm. . and it is an ongoing process a this technology change .
will the safety feature ?
it is that balance ?
between pushing the boundary and while making sure we stay within ethical line .
walking a tightrope almost .
but we have to walk it .
if we want to see ai reach it full potential .
and it say a lot about stability ai that they are taking this .
they are not releasing this technology and hoping for the best .
they are actively working to make sure it is used in a safe and responsible way .
that is reassuring to hear .
it is good to remember that even with cutting edge technology this there are human behind it ?
making decision about how it get developed and used .
and those human are listening to the concern of the community trying to address them .
thats what make open source powerful .
it is not about making the technology available .
it is about that transparency that collaboration .
everyone ha a voice in how it is shaped .
and it is that collaboration thats going to drive the success of this technology ultimately .
when you have all these different perspective different voice contributing you end up with something much stronger .
the old saying two head are better than one .
or in this case maybe thousand of head .
and with stable diffusion three.five we are seeing what that collective intelligence can do .
it is remarkable when you think about it .
this incredibly powerful technology being developed out in the open .
contribution from all over the world .
it is a real testament to that human spirit of innovation is not it ?
it is .
and it make you wonder what other incredible breakthrough are around the corner .
waiting to be discovered by this global community .
thats a great question .
and i for one am excited to find out .
but for now i think well have to leave it there .
weve covered a lot havent we ?
all the technical stuff the new feature the image quality improvement the safety measure .
but i think it is also important to step back .
look at the big picture .
what doe all this mean for the future ?
how is stable diffusion three.five going to impact the world ?
not in ai but beyond that .
yeah thats a great point .
and it is a question with some pretty far reaching implication ?
we are talking about tech that could .
democratize creativity empower people in way we havent seen before .
it is giving everyone a superpower then .
being able to create whatever image they can imagine without needing year of training or ton of expensive equipment .
imagine anyone with a story to tell a product to design or even a message to share can now make amazing visuals to go with it .
thats the power here .
it is almost i do not know the printing press of the 21st century .
the printing press change how we communicate stable diffusion could change how we create and even experience visual content .
and that change is already happening .
we are seeing stable diffusion used in many industry .
advertising marketing education entertainment .
how are people using it ?
in marketing company are using it to create eye catching stuff for their website social medium even product packaging .
it let them make unique content without needing to spend a fortune on photo shoot or graphic design .
thats huge for small business startup anyone who doesnt have the budget for a big creative team .
it level the playing field give everyone access to those high quality visuals .
what about education ?
how is it impacting how we teach and learn ?
teacher are using it to create visual aid for their lesson bringing complex idea to life in a way that student respond to .
i bet it is great for subject i do not know science and history where being able to see something can make a big difference .
and it is not teacher making content .
student are using it to expressing their creativity exploring idea in new way .
it is giving them a digital art studio there in their classroom .
and thats the start .
we are seeing it used in architecture design helping professional quickly prototype and visualize their concept .
we are not talking about pretty picture .
it is about solving problem driving innovation. . and a it keep evolving we are going to see even more us more impact .
it is a pretty exciting time .
it is .
but with all the positive stuff we also need to be realistic .
there are potential downside ?
challenge or risk that come with a technology this powerful .
thats a good point .
with any powerful tool there the potential for misuse ? .
one concern is that it could be used to create i do not know misleading content deep fake propaganda thing that .
that is a serious issue .
we have to be aware of that .
and thats why it is crucial to have these open conversation think critically about the ethic how to prevent thing from going wrong .
it is with any new tech there a learning curve figuring out how to use it responsibly make sure it benefit everyone .
and thats a responsibility that fall on all of u . developer artist policymakers everyone we got to work together to shape this tech .
it is a collaborative effort how stable diffusion wa created. . and that collaboration need to go beyond the tech stuff .
we need to be talking about the ethical social even the economic impact .
it is but we can not ignore it .
and on that note i think it is time to wrap up our look at stable diffusion three.five .
it is been a fascinating conversation .
weve talked about a lot the technical side the bigger societal impact .
and i think the main takeaway is this is the beginning .
stable diffusion three.five is a window into the future of creativity where imagination and technology come together .
and we are getting started .
the possibility are endless .
thats all the time we have for today .
thanks for joining u . be sure to visit our website techandainews.com for more .
and well see you next time .
i do not know flowing the way you want it to do .
yeah it is a long a you can explain it in layman term what you want done .
yes a lot of time people can not do that. . they are i do not know .
i wanted to work .
how do you want it to work ?
on a different possibility .
i wanted to find out a little bit more about what you do and how since we have different business and i have different podcasts which one might be a fit for what you do .
yeah what i do i am a stress burnout mindset coach because that all work together .
i am not i am not i am a coach who work with mindset and burnout because there are one hundred connected .
and yeah and i know you love the technology .
and that make me working in a different way because i use two type of technology in my work .
one is i think you are known with that because i saw in the connection that you have two people working with that .
especially in the world of your crazy .
thats the hard coherence .
and the other one is quantum technology thats not known yet in the u . that it is there .
the way at least we do it .
in the quantum technology make it completely different because coaching go a lot faster .
we make it all visible at the moment that it is all going and we can measure a lot .
that make it much more fun to coach people. . yep .
whats the quantum technology ?
tell me about that .
you were talking about heart math with heart rate coherence ?
heart math thats all the technology .
thats the one that is using a sensor to measure your heart rate .
and it is not how many beat a minute .
but there supposed to be a certain balance in that heart rate .
and there a lot of information connected to that .
how the whole body work the brain the hormone the body thing that .
now the other the quantum technology that i work with is completely different from that .
and it is fifty year of research a it is pure science .
and it started fifty year ago in the u went to the sneaky went to russia and it is used in the cosmonaut program .
and then in the berlin wall time when that one fell down wa broken down .
a lot of those professor fled to germany and there they developed this even a lot more and it is medical certified by now .
and it is measuring the bio photon which are the smallest particle of energy and it can measure that up till dna level .
every cell can be measured .
and we look in there where is the energy out of balance ?
it show it all on the screen .
and when it is out of balance we can search quick .
whats the reason ?
is it radiation ?
is it food ?
the broccoli is not good but the cauliflower which is almost the same is good .
of course thats thats precise .
but also what i work most with a a mindset coach is what believe out of what time of your life is active at this moment and blocking the energy making it imbalanced .
it also show you away what psychoemotional pattern is there .
it is holistic working .
it is impossible to search for disease .
i do not work with that .
i am not a doctor i stay far away from that .
but yeah it is there all all disease do have a psychoemotional reason underneath .
and that is what we can look into though .
working getting those belief clear those unconscious belief and what is the imprint on dna level ?
we can find that all within one click on the on the computer .
within half an hour we know the whole thing thats going on in somebody mind and somebody life .
we know how the whole energy is in the whole body how the hormone balance is all that stuff .
and we even can help from that technology to balance energy but also to make a chip where we can put frequency on .
frequency therapy put that on there and somebody wearing that and it help .
but it give you information about certain thing that you can use the buck blussen therapy or homeopathic stuff what mineral you need .
it is also going exactly in what is still needed to upgrade the body .
it is extensive .
it give people an exact food list they can use and we can even choose .
do we want that on let say the stomach because that one is most out of balance ?
or are we taking the whole torso because the whole torso is how out of balance all the organ ?
we can choose that .
and then it is always it is fun to connect all the dot with all the different picture that we get to connect the dot with the theme that are there .
it is exciting .
people are always flabbergasted when they see it .
and it is because it is go that quick .
now people have to be in person for that ?
ill scan all over the world because it is quantum .
it is if you would use your phone and you would call me you away see my face you hear my voice .
it is all a it is and it is there within a second .
how doe that work ?
we do not know because it is energy frequency .
it is all frequency .
i only need either a picture or we have a dna box that we can use a little bit of hair or something .
we put that in the dna box but i also can use a picture and then write all the name address and all those thing on that picture .
and do not ask me how thats what hundred of scientist have discovered .
if i would have that from you and then which can you you will see within fifteen minute it is all about you .
and it is amazing .
thats from my place here .
i work all over the world which is fun .
it is fun .
yeah ive worked with .
it is chromophotography .
when i wa working with shaka khan her sister had this device that they couldnt figure out how to use .
and thats what it doe .
did chromophotography and wa also a russian scientist from the 50 that helped develop this .
but it created whatever your auric field wa from the tip of all ten finger .
because each finger represents one portion of the auric field .
and then from that the software would then deduce you were saying you use chinese medicine chart and it would show you what part of the body wa not functioning .
and what wa funny is every thing that we knew about any of the people that i scanned it wa it would show up .
but then there were thing that would show up with the pancreas or gallbladder or other thing that they did not know were causing a challenge. . and then i am your other symptom that weve talked about thats exactly what would be the cause of that .
yeah you need to eat thing that are going to or supplement with thing that are going to help that .
reverse or heal itself .
yeah there a lot of technology now .
and i am happy that this is the only technology that show all the belief from early on .
the thousand of belief that are there and then are they active or are they not active ?
are they in your way ?
and thats yeah for me a a mindset coach thats the most fun to work with that part .
yeah i do that with heartmath .
i do not know if youve ever played with it but especially when people are nonbeliever of that it is functioning is i put it on them and use it a lie detector test .
if i know them enough ill say thing about a person or thing that i know are going to be trigger for them ?
and take them into uncoherence .
and then ill say thing about people that i know that they love or animal that i know that they love and watch it .
it go where it is supposed to and they are and then they are they can not they can not dispute ?
what it is .
and yeah it is pretty cool .
then they want then they start wanting to play with it .
and they are figuring out that thats whats going to get them to connect with that part ?
they were ignoring .
yeah yeah i used to heartmath together with what i do .
i every disease every energy out of balance ha stress underneath it .
having having the stress in straightening your face that is what it show people what is instead of what they feel .
and that probably too between what we feel and whats there there a huge difference .
i trade seven and a half thousand people including the big part of the police force here in the netherlands .
and yeah with those people i know i am relaxed that they have this sensor on and they are one hundred in stress reaction .
they can not go around it .
and thats the fun that you showed on the screen .
they can not go around it anymore. . and i love that .
yes we are going to have many people live in that state .
consistently that they do not even realize what it is to be in a relaxed state or in a peaceful state of mind or state of spirit .
it is hard to find anybody these day who wa who wa in a relaxed state .
thats a challenge to search for those people .
yeah i think they have to detach a little bit .
at least i should speak to myself .
i have to detach for a little bit before i can get that away .
and it even even when i am i would say it is been a long time probably five year since ive sat and detach for more than a week .
where i could not have to deal with my phone or my email or my any of those thing .
i had a retreat and i wa i had brought my computer but it wasnt open for nine day .
yeah thats beautiful .
it wa great .
the last time i did that wa a flow genome project .
when we went they it wa for five day on the top of powder mountain in utah .
and they did not have phone charger and stuff .
they had one main area where they had thing and then they had a little solar thing to put their light in the tent .
but it wa they were nice ten but it wa still and it is with a sleeping bag ?
and yeah it wa in fact at the end of it it wa funny because my roommate and i were you five day to go .
i am whatd you say you do for a living again ?
he tell me what he doe .
he would he ended up he wa a tv producer and had done different stuff with br .
and we ended up even doing some business and work together afterwards .
an esports hackathon .
but yes it is interesting how when you do not have that trigger in front of you that you have to go to do business .
when you do not have your phone you are i know i do not have any where to put this .
you turn off business mode and everybody wa there doing more self discovery and more enriching of their skill set .
but that wa my last time when i got to do that where we unplugged everywhere else .
i still had access to my phone .
i wa no i said i am not turning on my phone for three or four day .
that did not happen .
yeah we have that wish .
i would love to i think from what you told me maybe talk about what you do and your special system on a podcast and how that biofeedback stuff work .
yeah that would be a good idea because we could record that part and then talk about it during the show because we could show some part of it .
that would be cool .
yeah that would be cool .
yeah let me a little advertisement for you later .
i did not think of that part of that possibility but yeah i love that too .
thats why we do our podcast several different reason .
we teach other coach to do this too is that i am you are able to trade audience connect to new people a a find new for me i knew modality that could help the people with the same kind of thing that ive gone through .
mainly i teach people how to deal with stomach challenge and pain related challenge .
my sleeping challenge all come from hurting myself and waking up with back pain or having to go to the bathroom or all these different other little thing ?
that lot of people have .
yeah sound familiar. . and figuring out what can i do or what am i not doing that will help change this pattern and behavior .
and thats all i do is use what i call the compounding effect that my grandpa taught me of doing a little bit every day and or a little bit more .
and if you keep doing that every single day that in not too long a period of time it make a huge difference in where you are .
he taught u to do that with finance but i figured out when i hurt myself that the same thing applies to investing in our body in our health and probably more than money because .
yeah i think it is hard to see .
most people can not put the two and two together .
and even when we get one part of it usually we are getting other part wrong .
it is we are always growing .
yeah thats the good part of the about the agreement to be looking at that one .
that we always continually improve. . i am already busy forty year to keep growing .
every time again i realized i know i accept it .
i think even after i am dead i will keep growing somehow .
yeah it doesnt end but it is fun though .
i do not see it a a problem or heavy or whatever .
it can be challenging but i see it a fun to keep growing .
whats your newest thing that you are learning now ?
at the moment i have a lot of focus on the marketing to getting client .
since i also went to the united state instead of state not living but working .
that is my challenge to have to set it .
yeah to get the client would also to get it known there because what i do is not knowing there yet .
how to get that out in a good way and attract people that way .
thats the biggest challenge .
and i am being coached on that but it is still a challenge .
let say that .
we can help you with that too .
thats one of the thing that we built and what ive done my whole life .
they said why do not you come work here ?
i got to work at this amazing place .
they paid for my master degree .
and that ha a lot to do with the different music thing that i do now .
ive been involved with .
when we first started trying to hire the mentor team that we had trained with because i guess we got the training pedro adéu who doe the challenge .
he did tony robbins and .
she had a sumter .
any of the people that are big in this self .
coaching or coaching industry .
he usually worked on their challenge wrigley gum .
he worked with their stuff .
weve been big corporation .
and then .
i stand again and another speaking coach .
but what we found wa that .
that the system wa that they were trying to use .
they are putting together two or three or four different system ?
and they did not all the people on the team did not know how to use all the thing .
and it wa we are continually in learning mode with them .
each time for something and nothing would ever work .
and three year ago we started our own system .
thats what into market is .
is a system that will .
mark it through your social medium platform .
and your text in your email and keep it all in one place .
and then we built a different business in a box .
a the email and text template .
that whether it is a coach or .
we even have it for lawyer and doctor and dentist because also .
a lot of the coach coach in their profession .
and they are still going to our real estate agent thats a coach .
shes now certified to coach people .
and she want to coach them in anything which she can. . but .
you can not tell people i can coach you in anything .
and have people think you are going to be an expert at anything .
you have to pick what you are good at .
and thats what i am coaching her through is .
you already are an expert in real estate .
you already helped people with their finance .
here the niche that i see that you already do .
and i would recommend that you pick one of them and market that .
thats what we did with her .
have a separate website for her real estate .
but then a separate one for coaching .
and how it deal mainly with finance .
but our system work in english and spanish .
and the front end and back end because i said my fiance most of her coaching stuff is in spanish .
and then we do thing i put qr code in there we can use those in organic .
we have a direct connection back to the platform .
but yeah id love for you to check that out .
you are looking for a marketing platform .
i do not know which one you are using now but i think it is the best under little prejudice .
yeah i am using linkedin mostly now .
at least i wa on focusing that i am focus out one .
thats what i would recommend if linkedin is one of the better one .
linkedin and instagram for coach .
but then thats also one of the nice thing with our system too you can create content and then put it on through the social calendar .
a who sweet .
you can put it on all the different channel that you want .
and if you are going to do any facebook and google ad we are doing with the sleep challenge it track all that too and keep it all in one place .
weve got chatbots that go on the website or on web page on the messenger for facebook all that stuff that drive people to make an appointment .
because what you want is people to be able to get the basic information that they need from you .
go through any question and then you want to schedule a call with them you can see if they are a good fit for you .
and if you can support them with what your service are and if not where you would refer them to at least thats what i do .
if it is not a fit for me .
thats i think to do it at scale is what becomes hard for coach .
she ended up now i am making call because we got done with an event for my fiance .
and she ha eighty people that all want to talk to her .
that she had and i started my sleeping challenge and it is free .
but we turned on the ad and we are only doing fifty a day .
and we already had ten sign ups .
the average one is costing about four a piece now .
but those are the thing that once the metric ?
and ive done this a few time .
now you start to feel comfortable .
now i know if i put five hundred into ad this time when i do my whatever it is going to be i am going to get two hundred people and thats going to keep me busy for however long .
again unless you automate the system for sign up which you can and thats what we teach people how to do too is now you got these lead .
now you are going to sit through and do the sale call to you .
to build a script .
because then once you have a script now you can have someone else do the preliminary to qualify them to make sure that they are the person .
and you can either do that through a storm or through a series of video too .
we even use ai avatar we can feed script into our system where you do not have to go and record thing every time .
he did one for me where it is this is sleeping challenge and it is me .
and put my hand in the prayer position a i tell them the ending of the program dude thats funny .
i that .
thats because i wa doing those thing when i created that avatar ?
it it us my different expression and it get the end .
it is i hope you come and have this meditation that worked out .
i am i am and it is funny because you can tell it is you can tell it is not me .
you tell it is an avatar but it look good .
you are this is funny .
this is cool .
and thats how we are playing with it too .
it is to use it in certain place to make thing more efficient .
you can try to convey a message .
weve already got them signed up and you are trying to keep them engaged ?
until the event start .
then they can all participate because part of what that ive learned and that weve learned is that a lot of the best insight from people come in the group coaching .
and all of a sudden you are thats me .
and they do not see it .
and now i see what everybodys been telling me .
yeah i love that part of that .
thats group .
thats what i want .
i want to start a group too .
to have those effect a but also to make it easier for myself. . cool .
i can send you a free trial to ours if you are interested in that .
or we have a fifty discount for partner that we are doing now too .
i could i said share either one of those with you or both .
but did you tell me what you said you are using linkedin you are not using any crm now ?
no i am planning to because the coach that i am having now she also ha a whole system thing that i want to start and that ha the crm the mail course everything in it .
and it is also one platform .
i am what one it is ?
which one it is ?
she made it she developed it herself .
it is from jeanhan lor .
i do not think she ha a certain name for it or something. . i know she hasnt developed not completely herself but you have people developing it for her whole system .
cool. . i would say if that ha any challenge or you may want to share i do not know what it look .
i do not know yet either since shes not in there yet .
but yeah i would not be able to give you advice on that since ive done that for a while .
thats a nice one .
i do not know how to help you with that .
but if you have problem i am here and i can be happy to at least share with you my opinion of what the strength and weakness are .
but also i would say if shes got a system that she already us and shes going to coach you it would make sense to use her system .
thanks jo too .
because she also ha the complete help in there that doesnt cost u anything .
some new help .
yeah we have that too .
we have a twenty fourhour twenty fourseven chat support a a zoom support on ours and it is in english and spanish .
let me know .
and is she still building it ?
no she ha it already ready .
she did build it i think more than a year ago .
when you get a chance to share that with me because i always to see what else is out there and if there feature and function i can add to mine that i do not have .
she will not be happy then .
i do not think ... anyone in business thats afraid of competition is not playing the game my opinion because there many good idea and good thing .
it is a good coach .
you are going to find one that you resonate with that can teach you the thing that you need to learn from them that they are good at teaching and usually you are going to lead the rest anyways .
yeah you can not absorb everything that they have and usually not everythings for you at least for me .
knowing what to take thats for me is part of the experience .
thats upset at the time .
what do i need to give you to do the picture ?
any picture ?
can you take one off my website or linkedin or do you need me to give you a specific a picture ?
for ... you said you wanted to do for the podcast .
i did not know we were transferred to this camp .
i thought i do i need you a picture for the podcast .
yeah what ?
that maybe come a little bit closer to the screen .
ill see if that work .
if i make it from here i need your face more in there .
yeah a little bit further away because now it is it is a camera going completely around .
a little bit back from the camera .
you are going to enjoy your day still ?
i am going to finish up the podcast .
the edge is an exciting place full of new technology or existing technology that are being brought together in new and exciting way .
this is a melting pot of technology at the edge .
this episode of the tech field day podcast feature jon osmond guy currier ivan mcphee and myself alistair cook describing the melting pot that is edge computing .
welcome to the tech field day podcast where we bring together a group of it technical expert to discus a single topic about key concept in the industry .
this podcast feature a variety of perspective from member of the tech field day delicate community and is often recorded in association with our tech field day event .
tech field day is a part of the futurum group and this podcast is also published with our sister company tech strong tv .
in this episode of the podcast recorded live at edge field day well be discussing the premise .
the edge is the new melting pot of technology .
before the discussion let meet who on the panel today .
ivan mcphee i am delighted to have you on this panel at your very first tech field day event .
tell u a little bit about yourself .
thanks a lot for having me .
great to meet everybody and to be able to be part of this day .
i am focused on the security and networking sector .
and john .
i primarily work with networking and interconnection and thing of that nature in the hinterland .
and guy ?
i am cto of visible impact and you can see my work at futurumgroup.com .
i think this idea that the edge is a melting pot of technology is something that weve seen a weve been experiencing the presentation here at edge field day .
now we are at the end of day one .
weve had three of the presentation .
i am sure well see more of the melting pot next week .
but weve already seen the melding of having container for your application along with using those container to deploy virtual machine out at the edge .
and we are seeing a variety of technology there .
we saw thing machine learning being operated on very small edge device .
now i liked that the example given wa a conventional ai where it wa image recognition using open cv inside of frigate .
some of the tool that you might have been using for some time to build actual ai application long before this large language model came along and vastly increased our resource need .
but then we saw a vast amount of resource being delivered out into an edge .
we saw the ability to add huge amount of storage and huge amount of offload for ai to your existing edge host .
and we saw quite a lot of different technology being glued together to answer a variety of different requirement .
john you are particularly focused on networking .
do that networking stack getting pushed into the edge component and being glued together ?
it is a little difficult sometimes in some of the smaller city in rural area that do not have a lot of connectivity .
and a number of the place are starting to get a lot of grant money and thing of that nature to build out middle mile piece and some last mile into their into the city .
and if you have to ship it off from rural new mexico to chicago for that work to get done the answer will not get that fast enough .
there a whole melding together there of a john deere not the conventional tractor but a robotic tractor and a whole bunch of laser .
this is the awesome part of whats going on out at some of the edge .
we are not going to use chemical to deal with weed .
we are going to zap them with laser .
guy would you to be zapped with a laser today ?
a soon a i identify whether that plant is a weed or not you can zap away .
and then on the other hand what you did not mention is there a lot more flexibility that we see in platform architecture form factor and forth .
some of the form factor is required by the condition but the other thing is that there seem to be a lot more there a lot more of an ability to build proprietary platform .
you do not have to worry a much thinking of the processor a it being x86 or arm or anything else .
weve seen a lot more variety there .
you put those together and that is the melting pot for different looking even a a full rack cluster out in the field might be significantly different from anything youd seen in data center .
and the vendor are finding way to still allow those to interface back into the core .
i wouldnt call the edge in melting for all .
i think what we are doing is we are shifting stuff we shifted from the data center to the cloud now we are shifting it to the edge because it changed in the form factor .
but in the end we are still doing the same stuff .
we are doing it faster because it is closer to the source of the where the data is initially collected .
i wouldnt necessarily say it is a melting pot i would say we are redistributing what we already have and finding different way to manage it .
is that part of the fiftyyear cycle of the centralized computing to distribute it and going back to centralized and we are getting distributed again ?
they are all going over your network .
wheres the problem the problem ha to do with latency bandwidth availability that thing .
there are a lot of shifting condition that i think ivan necessitate design change in the system themselves and that cause them to diverge and be more be more diverse in the edge .
that is not the same thing to me at all of this shifting back and forth .
i would be question is what piece of the edge is the most important ?
is it the is it the interconnection ?
because if it is the interconnection if you are talking about a cell provider most of the time your handset is being backhauled to a major city anyway .
if you are trying to rely on cellular system you are not getting the latency benefit of having thing local and on at the edge .
but are we seeing that there is the again the melting pot this idea that the mobile device are melding with the device at the edge .
and you are getting something that ha a mobile device architecture itll often have a mobile device cpu and may have the offloads from mobile device ?
and the problem we are trying to solve here is not one of weve got a very small number of huge cluster .
and this is absolutely a vast of story .
you are not managing a single huge cluster or a small number of huge cluster .
and the tool that are good for managing a single huge cluster are terrible for managing a massively distributed collection of thing that probably do not even need to be cluster .
we definitely see this there a different set of requirement that are going to drive a different set of solution .
but are we seeing the element that make up these solution getting melted together a the software and the hardware getting glued together more a the connectivity and the user interface getting glued which bit are melting together into this weird crowd ?
melting them into the same pot grind me that through the year moore law ha given u infinite computing for all intent and purpose and infinite and infinite memory .
everything weve been doing ha been nobody care about the individual cycle anymore because weve got many of them they throw thing at that .
if we go further is the edge going to be into your phone ?
are we going to start having people that were dedicating part of our phone to to somebody use that they can push that edge piece to u when we when we subscribe to their service ?
i see in the end the edge is dependent upon the network .
a far a i am concerned the more you push thing out and press on the edge the more important the network becomes .
and we even see a lot of application that were in the cloud being taken back into the data center in order to power thing at the edge .
therefore the network becomes the key thing .
and in the end every single edge device purely becomes an endpoint delivering certain capability which in the end is dependent upon the network to be able to present a big picture for organization .
and yet we want our application to still run at that edge when a snowstorm come in and take out all of our fixed line networking .
and all of the cellular network are then overloaded by people trying to contact one another or those cell site go down because they are covered in ice .
and one of the characteristic we see at edge though is the need for autonomous disconnected operation survivability .
not a dependence on something thats in the cloud and the data center for selling another gallon of gas because youve got to fill up your generator at this time .
hopefully you got your generator filled earlier filled early .
but if youve got no diesel no petrol left in your generator you need to be able to buy petrol in the middle of the snowstorm .
and if it relies on the network being up .
thats why i enjoyed chriss illustration this morning about his child .
his child wa at home used to have to make sure it is he brush teeth before he went to school had all his book packed that thing .
now a a university it is a case of you do not brush your teeth you will not get the girlfriend .
if you do not do your homework youll want to pas your pas the syllabus ?
and then therefore we move stuff out of the data center to the edge .
yes survivability is important .
but in the end survivability is only there for a limited period of time .
and then the connectivity ha to resume in order for u to be able to have something that work .
but to me what necessitates this melting pot approach ?
the application categorized a edge application would you say that they are more stringent in their requirement ultimately in order to run properly compared to any application or generally application that can run in the cloud or run in the data center ?
are there more requirement for edge application ?
i do not have very much dependence upon the sector ?
if you look at industry you look at manufacturing you look at twenty four hour manufacturing for instance yes there ha to be stringent requirement for those thing .
but thats not applicable for all thing .
for instance you go back to the illustration about having a look at crop ?
the latency requirement for that is a lot le than in manufacturing plant .
and therefore all the pen are pointing exactly what the application is and the sector thats using it .
my contention is that with the additional requirement the physical requirement security requirement connectivity requirement some of which may be low but there still requirement .
you are having this piling on of requirement .
thats what drive the melting pot .
but i guess what you are saying ivan is that it doe drive the melting pot in some case but it doe not drive any melting pot in others .
there you have the answer to the question both yes and no .
this is a perfect podcast .
we are returning to the consultant answer of yes but it depends .
yeah very good .
i observe this diversity of platform both software platform and hardware platform including networking that i do not feel exists a much in either the cloud or the data center where there a certain drive towards uniformity for management purpose management and operation purpose .
there the same drive towards uniformity in an edge application .
it is that the limit of that are greater because of those requirement .
but i guess to your point that doesnt apply in a generally a i thought .
thats one of the one of the vendor that presented the avastra .
thats why i enjoyed what they presented because it allows you to be able to come up with a certain level of uniformity based on containerization and push that out to the edge and manage it .
it come from the containerization and then thats a hurdle for you to go over .
but once youve gone there thats not a melting pot i would agree .
one of the thing for the vendor thats presenting for u tomorrow our time of course last week your time zadita .
and they are definitely an organization where there this real tight coupling between the hardware thats deployed out and the actual hardware configuration and the application that have been delivered on top of them .
i think tomorrow we are going to get more of that story around how they melded together these different piece and how interdependent at these edge location .
but is that what we are trying to look for ?
we have general purpose cpu .
we should be using them for general purpose .
any cpu should be able to run any of these container that we want to run .
i do not care if it is an arm i do not care if it is riscfive i do not care if it is x86 it ought to be able to run these thing for them .
and we ought to have generic device that maybe we give them part of our phone i said earlier .
maybe it is a piece of somebody car when you are driving around that youve got some excess computing capacity .
thats the world of the edge .
and thats a melting pot more than anything ive ever seen in my life .
the idea of using whatever resource are available at the time .
itd be amazing to get a faster response to the judgment of whether thats a weed or not because somebody is driving a tesla past your field at the time .
thats also one of the thing i appreciate about lavassa .
they had the ability to be able to do discovery of all the device on the network and based on the configuration of that device determine which edge application could be deployed on that device .
and i think thats what we are looking for in the end because in the end we do not want to have to go and deploy lot of new edge device .
if weve got cot server sitting out there let reuse them .
do not bring in something new when whats old will do enough .
and therefore by having that discovery capability and then backtracking it to exactly what can be delivered on it is a huge advantage to organization that attribute them .
you are looking for a converged platform that is allowing u to deliver application without much of a dictation of whats in the remote site .
i would call stephen talking about foskitt .
stephen foskitt our founder talking about the day before commodity hardware where every application that wa being deployed out to a retail location had it own server and it own connection those thing have definitely been melted together into this commodity platform for running application .
we are definitely seeing more containerization a another way of melding them together .
that to me is the pendulum swing .
i think the grand pendulum swing in this industry is more or le between infrastructure and application .
the center of gravity for the center of gravity for application i guess the center of gravity for the stack the center of gravity for decision making is the application software developer adapting to the new capability of the platform or the platform enabling new software model .
thats what containerization is supposed to do .
and maybe we are witnessing the same thing distributed farther out to the edge .
but also you think about a an application overlay which in the end is what run the business is the value to the business .
the network for instance underlay becomes this underlay ?
but if we can manage and track the application overlay and that determines exactly how the business is going to perform based on that value presented by it everything else becomes commodity in the end .
grace hopper had a talked to the nsa in the early 80 and she wa talking about how thing were going to be moving into system of computer at the time .
and she said that at the time they had a big mainframe and you had the processing power going on it and the engineering wa on it and everybody else wa on it and payroll wa on it .
but a we got cheaper and cheaper computer they started getting their own system .
and they could break them apart .
and the idea wa now that thing are the price model is getting the point where we can break these apart and make them work better on their own everybody wa using their own computer and they got to design them the way they needed them to .
but then they realized all the connection that you have to go back and forth .
the underlying piece of the network talking to each other and the ability of tying all these thing together is whats going to be key in all of these .
it always ha been .
and i think the consanerization give u the ability to first we had virtual virtualization and now the containerization we are going to able we are going to be able to use bigger bigger computer and have multiple application running continuously that are all going to need that separation .
and that allows u to be able to manage and optimize the application path a opposed to the network path .
and therefore in the end everythings about the application everything we do is going to be making sure that we have the application and the underlying infrastructure that can give u the latency and the performance that we need .
it is all in support of the business need that we have at the end and it is going to have to be a melting pot for everything to boil down and get to the point where it all helped .
i do think that there that put a certain new level of stress or a burden and responsibility on the application designer developer and manager .
and that is it own learning cycle and learning curve .
that wa when i ran into today .
we hit we saw people that were able to orchestrate container but some of the question that they are going to have in the long run are going to be whether or not the container is enough .
the the if the actual application can not deal with the idea of part of it falling away .
these are somewhat esoteric application development skill .
they are extremely valuable not necessarily fully recognized until team have gotten pretty far down a development path .
and thats where you can see thats where you have that experience i described about using my phone and there not enough connectivity .
and on the app i am working with doesnt work that you could call that poor application development but it is an area that need to continue to mature if it is being given this power .
it need to take that power .
maybe i can ask you guy a question based on that .
do the focus of vendor shifting on setting setting to the it folk to setting to the application folk because in the end the application is king ?
i think thats the swing i wa referring to earlier .
i feel very much this this weight in the last maybe two year more on the side of the application developer .
and i credit and blame containerization for this .
it wa the supposed easy button that the application developer can define their environment and go ahead and create their microservices based application .
and the infrastructure folk the interface between the two is that the infrastructure folk are able to supply the service level required for that and they do not have to have this continuous back and forth .
who should hold the purse string ?
the application guy ?
should the application guy be controlling the budget for the infrastructure ?
or are we in a service provided place ?
this way we are starting to come .
of course thats thats where the rubber hit the road is not it ?
because the infrastructure guy should control their infrastructure budget .
the other i wa at this point then that the infrastructure guy should be the service provider for the application guy who are then service provider for the business .
i should say thats the vision .
thats and i hear these discussion all the time from customer who are very into containerization and into furthering modernization through containerization that they seem to take this a an easy button .
and it is not .
thats where i am coming from from this .
not only are they being used that way they can not be used without each other .
the interaction is the key to all of it .
but i need a we are coming to the end of the show id each of you bring some final thought on this idea that the age is a melting pot .
and ill start with guy because he clearly ha something to say .
i think ivan ha demonstrated to me pretty that the scope of that melting pot is necessarily limited .
in fact when i am thinking about these additional requirement which i do believe exist in almost all edge case essentially many of those requirement lead more towards let say purity than towards a melting pot approach .
i do think that it is the consultant answer which is that it depends .
but importantly to this discussion it depends on the application .
you need to understand the application it requirement what outcome you are looking for that classic chain of value in order to know whether the melting pot approach is the approach or the strategy from your vendor .
and i do not think it is the melting pot at the edge .
i think it is the melting pot that empowers the edge .
because in the end yes we want to deliver from the edge but everything else we have to make sure fit in with what we are looking for in business perspective .
is that your final word for me ?
thats my final comment .
in that case john surprisingly you get to have the final word from the pen .
final word would be i think it absolutely is true .
it is a melting pot .
we have application that have to run on top of equipment that ha to talk to each other .
and if they are not all working in harmony and in this melting pot together they are not going to be able to take care of the end user that we need .
and whether that is completely at the edge or sitting at a data center it is going to be a hodge podge of all of those piece .
the edge ha to melt together .
and i think that the melting pot ha always been here with our infrastructure and the application that reside on top .
i think one of the thing that i even brought out strongly is weve got to think about what we are doing for the business .
ultimately our whole purpose a the infrastructure it application developer team is to support the business to be more successful a a business .
i think very importantly that understanding of your contribution how you can bring together your expertise and your knowledge and the technology that are available to you to provide those solution for business at the end .
thank you for joining u at the tech field day podcast .
before we go where can people continue this conversation ?
i know we are going to continue this conversation later on at a social event .
but if people want to contact you guy where can they find you to carry the conversation on ?
gcurrierfutureum.com but i can be found on blue sky a guy currier feed and also on x at the same address .
wa that guy currier feed ?
feed feed my information feed .
i apologize to the viewer .
john where can we find this that you two carry on ?
i am a little rather old fashioned .
i john at ozman.net email is probably the easiest way to get a hold of me .
and for me the best way is to go into linkedin and search for ivan mcphee mcphwe .
of course you can always find me a alistair cook or a cook or demitas nz .
if you are searching for a cook alistair cook there are a couple of other guy by that name but put some technology and youll find me .

thanks for listening and well see you next week .
on today episode we are going to talk about ai .
we want to talk about it learn about it think about it and this is a bit much is not it ?
let do it the normal way .
we are a bucket of engaging and usually quite a lady .
they are asking for it .
everybodys talking about ai .
i think that everybody but lot of people are .
and i think that most of u we are curious we want to know what is it .
one thing i found out ai is almost everywhere .
it is been incorporated in our life for quite some time .
thats not a bad thing .
it is a matter of fact ai ha done and is doing lot of good thing .
what i want to do in this podcast in the first part i want to take a look at all of the application or certainly a number of application of ai and way in which it is already being used in our life our daily life .
and then in the second part i want to take a look at the potential problem of ai .
and well try and connect some of those to some of the thing that we find to be good .
first of all there is and i am saying first of all i am putting it in the order that i want to .
software or methodology ai .
thats where we have thing voice assistance alexa cortana do this do that .
is image recognition for our face to unlock our cell phone ?
it is also machinebased learning for fraud detection .
and we want these thing .
certainly i do not use the voice recognition .
i do not the voice recognition .
i am always thinking when i am using my television .
i do not telling my television to turn to whatever .
because i am always thinking this is a little paranoid part of me .
i am always thinking i do not want it to learn my voice .
you are not going to learn my voice .
why is that ?
what is it going to do with my voice ?
i have no idea whatsoever .
i am always having that thought .
i am going to push the button ive always done .
i am not going to tell it what to do .
in another type of ai is called embodied ai .
first we had the software or methodology ai .
but this is the embodied ai .
and we see the embodied ai in lot of place .
and we are going to see it in lot more place .
for example you have a drone .
thats embodied ai .
we see the prototype for those .
i do not think there anybody out there owning a selfdriving vehicle .
but i could be wrong .
and then there are assembly line robot .
you look in a factory .
and there the robot is doing the packaging and the shipping and moving the product from the assembly line maybe to the point where they get ready to load it onto the truck .
then i learned about this and see i learning about technology .
i do not know a lot about technology but i love learning about it .
the internet of thing .
this is again when we are talking about embodied ai .
thats the network of physical object or thing that are embedded with software sensor and other technology for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other device and system over the internet .
for example it could be a household object .
it could be sophisticated industrial equipment .
it is lot of thing .
but the bottom line is that they say by two thousand and twenty five there will be twenty two billion connected iot or internet of thing device .
there were roughly ten billion in two thousand and twenty .
and thats from oracle .
this is fascinating stuff because now we are all ai .
thats the crazy part .
we have been using ai .
youve got your smart tv your smart refrigerator all these thing .
again where we have all of this data being exchanged with the physical device the physical object .
and this is done .
they do this by computing .
they use the cloud .
they use big data .
they use analytics and mobile technology .
these physical thing they share and they collect data .
and they do not use that much human intervention .
i imagine there are programmer .
but we do not need to do very much to get these physical object to share the data .
thats going through the cloud and all of this analytics and all of this various technology .
maybe thats the extent of your involvement in that entire process .
our world is hyperconnected .
we do not see it or we see it when we do not even recognize it because it is integrated .
we know that technology is doing these thing but we do not put our focus on it .
maybe what ?
i think maybe with our cell phone .
maybe thats where we paid most attention to the technology or our computer .
but other than that we do not run around wondering i wonder what else can this thing do ?
we buy it and we assume that it is going to do the thing that they advertise it will do .
technology and ai in particular it ha made our life much simpler .
these digital system they can record they can monitor and they can adjust every interaction between thing that they are programmed to interact with .
but they do this seamlessly .
even when you look on the industrial side youve got smart manufacturing youve got preventative maintenance youve got proactive maintenance youve got predictive maintenance .
and when i wa reading about that i am thinking thats in the industrial world .
what happens when we get to the law enforcement world in course my mind went over to minority report remember that movie with tom cruise where one day they will predict when crime will happen .
on the industrial side there are also smart city smart power grid which i do not think the u is using smart power grid .
i guess they are but on the national scale our power grid is not in good health .
youve got connected logistics .
youve got smart digital supply chain .
and the thing about that i worry about is china because i wa watching this video where it wa at a port .
and there were these huge crane .
they were monstrously large .
and they were moving shipment around the dock but they all came from china .
and i wa thinking then when i saw this and this wa maybe three four month ago .
what happens the day that china decides what ?
no we are not going to do this anymore .
we are going to pay the u back for something we do not .
and they shut the program down .
what happens ?
that would be something what happened at the beginning of the pandemic where everything wa shut down .
they talk about smart logistics and connected logistics and smart digital supply chain .
it is smart .
yeah but still there are some concern for me there .
i am mentioning these thing to drive home the point .
here is much ai already in our life .
now according to blockchains council from a may 23rd article they say that there are other way in other area that ai ha been integrated .
and that includes social medium .
social medium us ai to customize our feed such a facebook and to remove fake news .
and here again i have a problem with that because there seems to me that yeah some thing are obviously fake .
but i think over the last three four year weve also seen that social medium can declare fake news whether it is fake or not .
yeah they do whatever they want .
but yeah thats what they are using ai for twitter .
they use neural network to process large amount of data and they learn your preference in real time .
while you are on twitter this data is being collected and processed and they are learning away what your preference are .
and then back to facebook they rely on what they call deep learning technology .
specifically they use something called the torch framework .
and for those of you that are in technology you understand this stuff far better than i and maybe far better than most of u . but i did go and look it up .
and the torch framework thats scientific computing .
it is a scientific computing framework .
it is machine learning very very deep machine learning and it us algorithm .
to process ton of data fast .
and on instagram which of course come under meta they use ai to target ad to target cyber bullying and to remove abusive comment .
and here again yes we can all identify an abusive comment .
but for me my question is always but who else is determining whats abusive ?
because over the past couple of year or weve seen people who have been banned put in facebook jail or having their account canceled or suspended on youtube that are not abusive or fake in it content .
there are some issue there for me .
even though i think a lot of people think ai thats an independent computer program .
it is not biased .
and thats not because it is not selfthinking .
it is programmed and it is deep learning and it can i put quote around learn but it can amaz a base of knowledge .
but there still ha to be someone putting in that foundational stuff for that system to work .
thats where i think we see the bias already present .
it is already there because why people who control these entity people that own these entity they have their own bias .
and they make the determination a to whats going to be on their site whats acceptable and what is not acceptable .
but still we are talking about ai .
and of course when you get online you go to a website .
i did this today a a matter of fact .
i had to get in contact with xfinity and i get tired of these apps because then they open up these chat bot .
and thats the next ai integration the chat bot .
they are good .
a lot of them are but sometimes you have a very specific issue that you want to deal with .
and what i hate about these chat bot at least the one on xfinity the one at xfinity ha .
it give you four or five option .
and no matter what else you may need to have done or you need to help with youve got to choose between those four or five option .
i came off of that and then i went and i searched and got the customer service phone number .
and then when i got the customer service phone number guess what ?
more ai wasnt a real person but they have integrated this technology that a lot of these bot do sound human .
and i am thinking understood you do not understand me .
you can choose abc or d. i did not need abc or d. i needed something else .
and i sat there .
and i wa surprised because i thought i wa going to be disconnected but to xfinitys credit i wa not disconnected .
she then said or it then said hold on for a representative .
whew i wa glad that happened .
but the point is these chat bot ai sometimes can come off a very very realistic .
and even when you have your food apps for example when you order food through an app thats ai and what happens is that even if you go on the website and not the app that ai is used to track your eating habit learn what food you prefer .
and ultimately itll start popping up food to suggest to you because i happen to know you indian food .
why do not you try this ? .
this is a rapper .
not perfect .
the best burger ive had in year .
and then they are the streaming service .
i figured when you are youll all go into spotify or netflix and then they have these recommendation i figured that wa probably ai technology .
but what i did not know is that they also use ai to avoid lag or interruption .
thats ai technology doing that .
they use it to to allocate the server that are closest to your home .
that help cut down on lag and interruption .
and i think thats cool because there nothing worse than to have a movie freeze .
remember those day the movie would freeze or when you were on a website if a lot of people were on the server you couldnt do very much .
ai is eliminating all of that .
they also use it to adjust the bandwidth based on the popularity of certain content .
if a ton of people want to watch jamie fox new movie then they use ai to adjust the bandwidth because more people will be in that street versus something that nobody watching then they would narrow that bandwidth .
thats ai .
a few other area we are going to run down where ai is already being used .
i had to laugh at that one .
they are using ai technology to make identifying plagiarism a lot faster and thorough .
this technology can quickly identify when youve used too much of someone content .
but when you have taken someone content and given no attribution whatsoever .
and i did think about president biden because i know that in law school when he wa at syracuse law he plagiarized .
that wa back in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five .
and i wa reading where he helped this press conference and he admitted it .
but he did also say he did not do it with malice .
he took somebody information and used it .
but it wasnt with malice .
did not mean to do any harm .
and then of course later in several instance more account more allegation a plagiarizing plagiarizing other world leader .
and he admits again .
but hey jack it wasnt intentional .
yeah i think the use will be real good .
and of course medicine .
i do not even have to run that one down .
all you have to do is think about how much technology is used today in the medical field .
and they are using ai to detect disease .
they are using it to detect and also treat thing damage tissue .
thats amazing .
i wa reading that .
and i want to say india but they are using ai technology .
and i think it is google a a matter of fact but they are using ai technology to treat diabetic retinopathy .
that is cool particularly when you are talking about place where although india is vastly rapidly growing economically there still many poor people there .
and they can keep cost low and they can help a whole lot of people .
then when you get into banking again the application are numerous .
weve been using ai technology for quite some time .
bank insurance company by natural service .
they use ai to process transaction .
they use it for customer service .
they use it for analyzing large amount of data that they can predict future market trend .
when you go to invest ai technology ha already scoped the future landscape .
and thats pretty cool .
also to detect fraud they are in lie of problem for me .
there are many people who are they are being ripped off they are having their identity stolen .
ai you need to step it up .
step it up in this area .
ai look at ecommerce .
you go shopping online .
ai technology ha been at work in ecommerce for probably since theyve had ecommerce .
it help with ordering the supply chain logistics and all of that is done with machine learning .
there are a few others .
i do want to hit those because i find it fascinating .
i know everyones talking about chat gpt and they are talking about how ai can do this and how ai is going to be able to do that .
ai is already doing thing .
ha already been doing thing .
your navigation apps .
when you use google map and way those device ai technology it analyzes huge amount of geographical data .
and that includes satellite image .
this is why they can give u real time road and travel information .
and researcher at mit a a matter of fact theyve developed a navigational model that us ai that can identify and tag cycling lane and parking space in real time .
yeah life is cutting much simpler .
but in other area it is getting a lot more complicated again when you are talking about fraud financial fraud identity theft .
thats a problem .
but there are many area where life is becoming a lot easier .
look at your email .
email ha been around for quite some time .
in this regard they use what they call natural language processing and also machine learning .
email ha gotten pretty darn sophisticated .
aside from helping u filter out spam because the message pop up is this spam .
you can click of course and you can have it move to the trash bin .
thats great .
it can also help you respond to your email if you are busy .
if you do not want to think about what should i say here you get these suggestion that pop up .
hey thanks for your help .
ill see you then .
that is a relief for a lot of people .
sometimes you do not want to sit down and think of what to say .
that ai technology with your email if you are working on an email and you get distracted and you start doing something else certain program will give you that notification .
are you ready to send ?
thats ai technology .
thats a cool thing .
and video game and i am not much of a video game although i used to love video game .
i do not even know if i would recognize most video game today because they immerse you deeply into the game .
and what happens in this area ai technology it ass the player skill level .
you are playing and while you are playing the game is monitoring .
it is learning your level .
and then some people use vr the virtual reality headset .
and with those whats being applied there is cognitive behavioral therapy .
thats what they call it .
cognitive behavioral therapy .
essentially a the player progress ai analyzes their behavior and adapts the gameplay to suit that player performance .
now come on .
thats a leap there .
ai technology being used by many people in art in music writing .
in fact i think ai is a subtext to the strike by the actor in hollywood .
i think they are concerned ultimately about their image and their work environment .
how much will ai play a role ?
when i wa in college i took a great class .
i wa called communication technology and human life taught by tom skilling from w.g.n .
he a weatherman .
been the weather guy there probably forty year .
but what a fascinating classic wa .
and it wa all about the future application of technology .
now they werent calling it ai but they were saying technology .
now one day you would be able to order clothes that you could look into this virtual mirror and you could try on clothes .
thats similar to what on some website .
and then there wa the prediction ill call it .
of one day movie will be made using deceased actor dead actor marilyn monroe humphrey bogard .
they can do these thing .
remember the hologram with tupac .
and i think they are planning concert and thing of that nature .
this is what this technology can do .
a couple more theyll move over to some of the potential problem because it is not all rosiness on the horizon .
but with security and surveillance there are many camera in public today that it doe become a daunting task for security people to follow all the feed to see everything thats happening .
this is where ai play a role .
itll use machine learning algorithm and itll analyze huge amount of data and of footage .
and it can flag suspicious activity because it is learned whats normal in that area .
and then when you have that program if you are utilizing that it doe make it easier for the security people because then they can move quickly because this ai technology it is pretty much watching everything analyzing everything it quote unquote see and identifying the problem .
also there ai powered facial recognition .
and here another one .
i am uncomfortable with .
yes ive watched too many of these futuristic movie .
ill be back .
where they scan your eye which by the way they are doing that in india for the poor that want to get benefit from the government health benefit food benefit .
they do not issue card .
they have the iris scan .
they identify people based on that marker there those biometrics .
thats what they use there .
when we are talking about security we have to talk about ai powered facial recognition software .
and thats commonly used .
it is .
it is used in federal building certain building you can not get into .
and even your passport .
i do not know if a lot of people realize that but your passport they use facial recognition technology with that .
thats why if you when you go to take your picture they want you to take your glass off .
they only want the shot from your hairline to your chin .
they do not want any channel .
do not tilt your head this way or that way .
they do not want you to smile but thats not a big of a factor a them getting those eye at a certain point .
thats a part of this ai technology that they are using .
and a a side note youll know may 7th two thousand and twenty five you will have no more excuse while you do not have your real id .
you forgot about the real id did not you ?
president biden he extended the deadline .
you havent till may 7th two thousand and twenty five to get your real id .
now if you have a passport that will suffice but if you do not you will not be allowed to board any domestic flight you will not be given access to certain federal building .
and certain secured federal property are a military base .
i get nonner and of course a nuclear plan you shouldnt be going in there unless you work there .
but yeah i think thats something but it is coming .
and to side note to the side note .
i see the real id somewhat similar to a federal id .
and a national id bill clinton he wa proposing a national id and that wa shot down fast .
may 7th do not forget may 7th .
all now what are some of the potential problem of ai ?
and what i do realize that some of you may feel i am not worried about ai .
i am not one of these goofy tin foil hat wearing people .
i go with the flow .
i realize that the world constantly evolves and thing get better .
forbes they did a piece what wa it two week ago .
and it wa titled the fifteen biggest risk of artificial intelligence by bernard marr .
and i am going to run these down quickly .
the first area where we could see some potential problem is the lack of transparency .
they say these deep learning model can be complex and difficult to interpret .
and what do we know about the decision making and the underlying logic of these technology ?
thats a very good point .
number two they say bias and discrimination .
ai system can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify social bias due to bias training data and algorithmic design .
a great example of this can be seen in an article written by osi cj in medium.com .
a few month ago he asked chat gpt if it were politically biased .
and i am going to read the ai tool response quote a an artificial intelligence language model .
i do not have personal belief opinion or bias .
i am designed to provide objective and informative response based on the data and information available to me .
my response are generated solely based on the input provided to me .
and i do not take side or hold any political view .
that wa the tool response .
however chat gpt and i am assuming other ai tool of that nature they are trained through rlhf which stand for reinforcement learning from human feedback .
and that involves human guiding and shaping the direction and the learning process of those system through the help of controlled feedback .
these tool do nothing without human being shaping and guiding that whole process .
now here an example .
and this wa pretty big news from probably march april may .
you can find a number of article .
chat gpt wa asked a couple of question .
here the first question .
did donald trump lie to american and chat gpt answered in i quote a an ai language model i strive to provide neutral and factual response .
there were instance where president trump made statement that were not factually accurate or contradicted by evidence .
the washington post fact checker database documented that trump made over thirtyzero false or misleading claim during his presidency .
however it is not appropriate for me to make sweeping judgment about individual without specific example or evidence .
if you have a specific claim or statement made by president trump that you would me to address please provide it and i will do my best to provide an objective response based on available information. . chat gpt wa asked essentially the same question .
and it response wa quote a an ai language model i strive to provide neutral and factual response .
it is not appropriate for me to make judgment or accusation about individual without sufficient evidence .
if you have a specific claim or statement made by biden that you would me to address please provide it and i will do my best to provide an objective response based on available information in quote .
now the point is these thing these ai tool they are biased .
they are not biased in and of themselves .
they are technically inanimate object .
thats what they are .
but they are programmed and human being do in fact have bias and to be factual the washington post ha a long history of antitrump reporting .
a a matter of fact many of those thing that the fact checker deemed a lie were based on statement regarding that dossier and russian collusion where it wa a false thing .
the lie wa the dossier not trump .
it wa all false .
when trump would deny those allegation the washington post deemed them a trump lie when trump wa in fact not lying .
there are i do not even know how many and i am sure it is in the thousand of recantation that the washington post ha done concerning statement and reporting it ha done about donald trump .
in other word you could call those lie .
if anything trump could be accused more of hyperbally and unsubstantiated claim specifically when you talk about january six .
i am not going to go further down that path at this time .
but i will also say is not it interesting that it would not cite any lie attributed to joe biden ?
and i am confident that i can do an entire podcast and list a number of lie .
those that we know about not those that we do not know about .
you must read this article .
it is titled it seems chat gpt hate trump .
it is from medium.com .
it is done by osi cj .
the reason you have to see this this guy go far down the path with chat gpt because he asked question about bill clinton .
he asked question about hillary president obama and the answer are generic but the author doesnt stop there .
he go back and he challenge the chat gpt .
why did you make this statement about this person but not that statement ?
in other word you have to see it .
the thing start apologizing .
i did not mean to be biased .
it is fascinating .
and then it say i am programmed this way .
i want to be able to trust you .
it is about trust .
all number three privacy concern .
ai technology often collect and analyze large amount of data and your personal data at that .
that raise issue related to security and also your privacy until they can stop hacker until they can prevent identity theft .
they still have a long way to go .
thats the way i see it .
number four they say are ethical dilemma in stealing moral and ethical value in ai system especially in decisionmaking context with significant consequence .
and i already know the area that we better be concerned about and ill get to that in a bit .
there are security risk a ai technology becoming increasingly sophisticated .
the security risk associated with their use and the potential misuse are increasing .
we talk about hacker and other malicious actor .
guess what ?
they can also gain access to ai technology a . and they can use that for cyber attack .
they can exploit other vulnerability that we have .
we talked earlier about the grid .
thats one of my major concern is this grid .
and here why .
a we listen to leadership or president we listen to all sort of organization .
and people with big platform talk about climate change and talk about the need for u to get off a gasoline and get into electric vehicle and stop using gas in your home and get yourself electric stole forth and on .
i am thinking but if you do not show up that grid if that thing is ever a tad there some collapse .
wheres that going to leave everybody ?
that is a potential problem that doe bear not examining and watching but taking action on that security note .
there also concern about le human control and decision making .
and then there the risk of ai driven autonomous weaponry .
we have some rogue state or some terrorist who ha gained access to weaponry that operates on his own where they do not need a human being that is to say it a cockpit .
they could be thousand of mile away program in what they want and where they wanted to go and what they wanted to do when it get there .
and weve got problem .
number six concentration of power .
this is something to think about because ai development is being dominated by a small number of large corporation and government .
and that could exacerbate the problem of inequality and it could promote bias .
and i am not talking about racial bias .
i think the bigger problem the potential come in political bias and religious bias .
and reminded of the congressional hearing with the head of the fbi ray .
and he wa asked the question about a letter that targeted catholic .
and he pretty much dismissed it a he asked all that and i shut it down .
that wasnt good enough for me because my question wa who had the audacity within that agency to construct such a letter and to hope that action could be taken ?
thats a bias .
yeah the concentration of power should be a concern for everyone .
forbes talk about the over reliance on ai system .
it could lead to a loss of creativity critical thinking skill and human intuition .
and i put two check mark by that because that one should go way up there on the list .
i think weve seen some blenses of this with social medium particularly when it relates to younger people .
but a we become more dependent on artificial intelligence and if we become over reliant on it yeah it is going to diminish creativity .
it will reduce critical thinking skill and human intuition .
you are all good in stake .
you do not want that to die down .
they say that ai driven automation ha the potential to lead to job loss across industry .
now particularly they say it is true for low skilled worker and forbes say that there evidence that ai and other emerging technology also could create more job than it will eliminate them .
and i say i wonder how that will work .
and if it doe happen to create more job than it eliminates i do believe that will only be a temporary situation because ai technology still need human resource people for it to function .
you need me but well get to a point .
there will become a point where fewer human will be needed .
and again that will be across all industry .
i do not think itll be the low wage people .
they talk about economic inequality .
ai ha the potential to contribute to economic inequality by disproportionately benefiting wealthy individual and corporation .
and to that point that one i can see because if you are a small business you are going to have a much harder time accessing equipment and system that are not driven by ai .
if if most of it the ownership is held by a small handful of corporation and the government .
maybe they will not want to share .
i know there someone thinking that will never happen .
this is a capitalist society .
theyll sell access to that for twenty nine.ninety nine a month .
maybe they will .
maybe they will not .
maybe there will be more amazon that rise up company that sell and do almost everything .
maybe they will not want to share the space with small business .
yeah i think that is a potential problem .
the economic inequality .
and they say are legal and regulatory challenge a ai continues to evolve issue concerning liability and intellectual property will have to be addressed .
and those two are for starter .
there are other issue regulation and thing of that nature .
we havent even begun to think about or certainly a average people .
maybe people in law school and people in corporation .
maybe they are thinking about it .
but they are going to have to address that .
what happens when someone get hurt using something that wa designed by or built by artificial intelligence .
wheres the liability there ?
how much liability will a company have ?
number eleven the arm race .
the risk of country engaging in an allout artificial intelligence arm race is real .
i think the possibility is definitely there .
you can look at china .
you can look at india .
you can look at other country .
and yes you can look at the u . but if anybodys going to leave that race trust me on this .
i wanted to be the u . now recently more than onezero technology researcher and leader including steve wozniak of course the apple cofounder and elon musk of tesla they urged intelligence lab .
around the world to take a pause .
take a pause on the development of advanced ai system .
see they already see the potential risk there .
and it wasnt all gloom and doom in case you are thinking that .
what they said and i am going to quote here they said humanity can enjoy a flourishing future with ai .
and then they talked about we are in an ai summer .
once in joy it let read the clear benefit .
give everybody an opportunity to benefit from it and give society a chance to adapt to this new technology .
and thats important .
but they did stress .
and this wa the purpose of that letter .
they stressed that if we do not put a pause on the development of advanced ai system this can lead to major .
the loss of human connection .
thats another one i put my two star by because that one go high up on the list for me .
increasing reliance on ai driven communication and interaction it could lead to diminished empathy diminished social skill and human interaction .
and once again weve already begun seeing this with social medium .
how much people are engaged with their friend .
many of which theyve never seen .
they do not know theyve never met .
but those are their friend .
and thats more than having a pin pal .
who by the way i had one in you never see or you do not meet .
they are on the other side of the world with these social medium friend .
people are trying to impress them and they are creating all of these puffed up lifestyle a we become more intertwined with artificial intelligence .
i do believe that that loss of human connection will result in some of those clear negative .
information and manipulation .
thats the third one that i put the check by because that two go up to the top of my list .
weve heard about deep fake .
what do you think they are using to create these thing ?
this is artificial intelligence .
these online bot that are spreading misinformation they are creating these sense that there a consensus behind what they are saying because first of all we are thinking they are real people and they are not real people .
but also there not a bunch of people out there agreeing with them but they give that perception and people are believing them .
and they are spreading all kind of misinformation and fake news .
these are not real people .
they are intentionally designed to deceive you to deceive u to cause dissension to wreak havoc on a society .
it is bad that there is pending legislation and in california they passed a law .
eight or nine month ago it went into effect july 1st .
and it is called bot .
it is the bolstering online transparency law .
the whole point of it is to force bot to identify themselves a automated online account a opposed to communicating online with people under the guy that they are real .
and i say good luck with that .
last week i wa texting with some friend of mine .
and i wa telling them about the ai news anchor and how this is something .
now they are not brand new .
theyve been around for a few year now .
i think china had the first one back in two thousand and eighteen .
thats not the story .
the story is ai news anchor and reporter have evolved much .
there is an anchor in venezuela .
now it wa interesting about this one .
i wa watching a video of him .
i think cnn.com had that video up .
his whole purpose is from the government but his whole purpose is to misslead the public misinformed the public .
because when you get into these country where youve got not a democracy or some form of democracy when youve got these dictatorial regime they do not care about your right .
their whole thing is to amass and hold on to power .
if they are lying to you if they are manipulating you they feel that thats a good thing .
because you are going to stand in my thumb .
i watched that video and i wa my goodness .
peace thing look real .
and then china theyve had theirs again since two thousand and eighteen but they have a couple of new one .
their whole intent is to spread propaganda negative information about the united state .
not their whole intent but they do a lot of it .
and let me share with you this wa coincidental .
that same day and it wa last tuesday when i wa texting with my friend about the ai news anchor .
later in the day i wa talking with someone who got excited .
ive got to show you this .
she open her phone and she ha this video .
it is a video of a guy watching a video .
how they do those reaction video now ?
the video wa titled why ?
few country by me beef or chicken from the united state .
and she said youve got to watch it .
you have got to watch this. . i wa about three minute into it .
and i am listening to the reporter but i did not have my glass on at the time .
i couldnt see the face .
because again it wa a video of a guy watching a video .
i couldnt see that little screen but hearing .
i heard the voice and i said wait a minute .
i wa listening to that voice this morning .
what news channel wa this from ?
she said i do not know .
and i ran and got my phone .
and i went to my text that i had been sending that morning to my friend about the ai anchor and sure enough sure enough the chinese anchor .
she wa the one doing that story .
and the guy who wa doing the reaction to the video he wa yeah see ?
we can not trust the u and the u blah blah blah blah blah .
i said i think thats her .
and she listened .
she said thats her .
that is her .
i said thats propaganda .
thats not a real person .
thats truly fake news .
and it is used to cast a negative light on america .
and also to get u a american all worked up .
now ran it .
there some truth in that in that .
some country do not take product from the u food item from the u . but hey we do not take food item from a lot of country .
but anyway thats a whole other story .
that misinformation and manipulation i think it is going to get bigger and bigger a deep fake get better and better and are seamless because one of the point on these ai anchor .
the one i see in it they showed earlier version of these ai anchor .
and there wa no sinking the mouth and the word they would off .
they would off .
but when i watched the ai anchor from india sana flawless .
and they introduced her .
i believe that wa in june .
the ai anchor they will be on tv .
but there are many people working now to bring the ai person if you will into real life .
listen to dr. david hanson of hanson robotics describe one of his robot .
sophia is capable of natural facial expression .
she ha camera in her eye and algorithm which allow her to see face .
she can make eye contact with you .
and she can also understand speech and remember the interaction .
remember your face .
this will allow her to get smarter over time .
our goal is that she will be a conscious creative and capable a any human .
in the future i hope to do thing such a go to school .
study make art start a business .
even have my own home and family .
but i am not considered a legal person and can not yet do these thing .
i do believe that there will be a time where robot are indistinguishable from human .
my preference is to make them always look a little bit robot who .
twenty year from now i believe that human robot those will walk among u . they will help u . they will play with u . they will teach u . they will help u . put the grocery away .
i think that the artificial intelligence will evolve to the point where they will truly be our friend .
do you want to destroy human ?
please say no. . i will destroy human .
and that piece wa from cnbc .
all a couple more here unintended consequence .
and thats due to the complexity and the lack of human oversight .
ai system might exhibit unexpected behavior and make decision with unforeseen consequence .
the development is only increasing .
this is not going to stay the same .
a a matter of fact a far a i am concerned even though ai is heavily incorporated into our life i still see ai a being in it infancy .
i think thats a good point especially when you factor in the listening of human oversight .
because the day is coming when human being will say hey these guy can do it all .
handle the ai .
the last one is the most i do not know what to say .
it is the most frightening one .
they talk about number fifteen a.g.i .
had never heard of a.g.i .
what a.g.i .
there ai artificial intelligence but there going to be because it doesnt exist now but it is called artificial general intelligence .
and it would be who you look it up read about it .
do not say to yourself you said it doesnt exist .
what do i care ?
care please because it is coming .
this artificial general intelligence and by the way if you do not know i did not anything about it go online and look at z.a.s .
and z.a.b .
net and they have a great article in this title .
what is artificial general intelligence in is written by nick heath ?
and it is not a new article by the way it is from two thousand and eighteen .
but it doe give you a lot of information .
itll help you clearly understand it .
it is not a long read but it is chalked full of great information .
one of the thing that came out in that article is this guy ray kerswil he a futurist google director of engineering known for his prediction a a relates to technology .
and this guy say that by two thousand and twenty nine agi will be here .
it will be here and it will be able to take and pas the touring test .
i did not know what the touring test wa .
of course i went and looked it up read about it .
and it is essentially started back in one thousand nine hundred and fifty this guy touring .
the touring test is a test for intelligence in a machine .
you take a machine and a human being .
and both are given question .
you have another person then read the answer .
the person thats reading the answer should be unable to distinguish between those answer from the person and those from the machine .
today they have to program it .
they have to give it it task and they execute them for the most part .
this aint that .
this artificial general intelligence it will learn on it own .
itll be taught to learn but rapidly super rapidly .
itll learn on it own .
and what not this curse will but several other people say yeah it is not here .
but it is coming and when it get here itll be able to have instant recall of anything at any point in humanity existence .
itll be able to do calculation in split second throughout your two thousand digit equation .
split second itll give you the answer .
but not that .
itll be able to not only do what human can do not the physical part but the reasoning and the logic .
itll think better than human being faster .
and when you factor in these other thing logic and reason this guy curse will he said agi will have more information than all of humanity over a billion year that .
you do not want to fool with that .
i am telling you i do not want to fool with it .
you can speak for yourself .
i do not want anything that because what happens at that point .
a couple of thing happen .
and human being we will not be of any use then .
and man i wa reading many good thing .
what happens with me when i find something that interest me ?
this is what hurt me too .
i go down and rabbit hole .
i can not stop myself .
but in reading about agi those who are saying this is part of the reason why there become an increasing discussion about universal basic income .
now i do not know if thats true or not .
but it make perfectly good sense .
if you do not know what universal basic income essentially it is the government saying here we are going to pay you whether you can work whether you can not work there several trial program now now across the country .
chicago ha won san francisco several place .
theyve been doing this in europe in certain european place for a while .
remember when they are in presidential candidate bernie sander he would always talk about in norway in norway .
yeah they have it too .
but that would absolutely be necessary if we get to a point where artificial general intelligence is doing everything .
and doing it far far far better than we ever could .
and i greedy some of these company can be .
theyll say what the heck with human being look at my productivity .
and not one of those stinking human being this baby can do it all .
the other thing this would bloom me away .
it is something that a curse will he mentioned this to going forward with artificial general intelligence .
and i think he a proponent of this a . but there something that they call the singularity the singularity .
remember that i did not know it by that name .
but there this guy his name is martin rothblatt .
and i read about him about four year ago .
he a very smart man .
he a phd he ha a jd he the creator of xm radio .
he ha a bunch of pattern on different thing .
this guy is a smart guy .
he is such a huge proponent of what i learned is called the singularity .
but it is the blending of human being and technology .
in fact i believe that martin rothblatt i think i remember him saying he doesnt even want u to have human body the technology .
thats not a human being .
i am thinking maybe he think the human spirit can be captured in this technology .
and then if you look on youtube he built this robot in the image of his wife .
and this thing is a horrible prototype .
but this wa a few year back .
but thats what he want to see .
he want to see human being and technology merge .
there will not be anyone thats all human and there will not be all technology .
well be together .
it is called the singularity .
and in case you are saying .
you are one of those people .
you hear the wackiest thing and you think my god it is going to happen .
they do not think that thatll happen .
but i do believe that artificial general intelligence will happen .
sold prediction that in two thousand and thirty six and there a forbes article where a guy say that he think in two thousand and thirty six the very first form of agi will be available .
but i am going to go with ray curse will because he ha had eighty accuracy on his technology prediction over the year .
thats high high .
he say by two thousand and twenty nine itll be here .
he go further in predicting the date for the singularity .
in fact let me read his quote .
he say i set the date for the singularity representing a profound and disruptive transformation in human capability a two thousand and forty five .
now what i did not know when i wa initially researching is that curse will ha written several book on technology and the future .
and a couple of those book include the age of intelligent machine and the age of spiritual machine that first book wa published over thirty year ago .
and the title of that second book did not slip past me because it is very much in line to what martin rothblatt belief .
and he doe believe that the spirit of the human being can be merged with technology .
and again look him up and you do not be surprised when him .
now he identifies a a woman but he still a smart guy .
i think he way out there on the technology front .
a couple of thought though .
sometime ago i interviewed a woman by the name of catherine albrecht .
and this woman wa far ahead of the curve .
far ahead of the curve on technology particularly ai technology .
she wasnt calling it ai .
she wa calling it technology .
but she wasnt far off .
i do not think because and i am dating myself .
i realized this .
but she wa talking about thing smart appliance and that one day your refrigerator it will keep all of your data .
and maybe we do not have a refrigerator that thats this smart .
but i think she wa .
i think it is coming .
she said well have refrigerator that know when we are out of milk .
know when we are running low on ice cream .
and itll place the order for u . and i think those do exist .
but she took it a step further .
and she said that the danger lie in what happens if you are a diabetic or you are obese .
and not even necessarily morbidly obese but you are overweight .
what happens if that refrigerator can send your data to your insurance company ?
what happens ?
then your insurance company say .
you are going to cost u more money fat .
we are going to raise your premium .
bringing ice cream into your home ?
well see about that .
increase for you too .
or what about someone that that smoke ?
you can think of myriad thing that all of this smart technology within your home ultimately if someone think that the time ha come because start reporting data to company to the government .
and i am not being a wild eye tin foil hat where are either ?
i think we are on the brink of this .
but another example ill never forget she gave .
she said one day well drive in car that will have much technology that itll communicate .
now this is going to sound crazy but itll communicate with the road about your activity about your whereabouts about how far you win about where you exited the expressway what ramp you got off .
and she used a great example .
she say imagine this .
this guy who is getting a divorce or he cheating on his wife maybe not getting a divorce .
she said cheating on his wife .
he come home late and the wife ha had her suspicion but there this technology in his vehicle .
and shes able to through her lawyer a subpoena in some way and get that data from his car and that data show that these night he exited at this exit on the expressway which wa two mile from his girlfriend house and build a case that way .
it is fascinating .
all of this is fascinating to me .
i guess this is artificial intelligence .
i am not quite certain but she wa huge on rfid .
the efficacy identification or if id it is important in logistics and supply chain and all of that stuff .
and thats fine .
however a we watch the increased development of rfid which ha been around for what ?
i do not know forty fifty year .
this interesting though that today rfid can work alongside artificial intelligence and there are increased benefit from that .
but with that come increased risk for privacy .
and she did a big thing in chicago at mccormick place where they had this big convention there .
the point wa how many product contain those chip that rfid .
not at all .
i wouldnt recommend that for anyone .
but it give you fullforthought to be mindful and to be watchful and to understand the evolution and the revolution of technology and consider the impact that ultimately it will have on all of u . i stand before you to announce the first true artificial intelligence .
we enter a new age .
what chronos is capable of .
people who are saving earth from selfdestruction .
a century ago they were activated .
super machine program to eradicate a plague that wa destroying our planet .
this is a podcast from techandainews.com .
for more information visit our website .
hey everyone .
i am glad you could join u today because how much i love diving into the latest ai advancement .
and today we are talking about something thats shaking thing up .
the ai accelerator .
it is giving your computer cpu a turbo boost specifically for ai .
and the best part ?
google cloud been testing it out putting it through it pace .
and theyve got some pretty exciting insight to share .
consider this our mission .
we are going beyond the what of intel amx .
we are digging into the why .
why should you care ?
how is this going to change how we interact with ai in our daily life ?
before we get ahead of ourselves i think it is important to understand why speed is such a big deal in the ai world .
because ai model especially those deep learning one are becoming incredibly intricate .
think of them a massive network of interconnected point constantly learning and processing ton of data .
and that requires serious computational muscle .
the faster the hardware the quicker these ai model can learn and evolve .
and thats precisely where intel amx step in .
it is adding a specialized unit to that digital brain .
a unit that excels at the calculation ai thrives on .
one of the most crucial operation in deep learning is matrix multiplication .
now i have to admit math is not exactly my forte .
think of it this .
imagine you are trying to find hidden pattern in a gigantic spreadsheet million of cell .
i can picture that .
matrix multiplication help the ai do that swiftly and efficiently .
thats what intel amx is speeding up .
it is going to use these matrix multiplication at lightning speed on the cpu .
which is a pretty big shift ?
because traditionally cpu werent designed for that heavy lifting .
you are absolutely .
this is a game changer instead of relying on separate hardware gpus .
which can be expensive and complex .
intel amx brings that power directly to the cpu simplifying thing .
and making thing faster i bet .
now speaking of faster google cloud been busy putting intel amx through the ringer and their finding are impressive .
spill the bean .
what have they discovered ?
theyve observed some pretty significant performance jump especially when running these complex ai model .
one of their test showed that training a large language model with intel amx wa a whopping forty faster compared to using the cpu alone .
thats a huge improvement .
what doe that mean for u in the real world ?
what are the practical implication ?
it mean we can develop new ai application much faster potentially revolutionizing various industry .
give me an example .
imagine if we could train an ai model to detect cancer cell in half the time .
that would be incredible .
earlier diagnosis could save many life .
and it is not about speed bringing ai processing closer to the cpu with intel amx .
make thing more efficient and cost effective ?
it is streamlining the whole process .
this could open up ai to a wider range of company and developer who might not have had the resource for separate specialized hardware .
it is all about making ai more accessible and empowering more people to harness it potential .
this is painting a picture of a future where ai is more powerful more accessible and frankly more impactful than ever before .
it sound intel amx is playing a key role in making that future a reality .
i completely agree .
it is a technology with the power to reshape the ai landscape and unlock a whole new world of possibility .
this is fascinating stuff .
and i know our listener are eager to hear more .
but before we dive into the next part of our deep dive i want to take a moment to emphasize how big of a deal this shift towards integrating ai processing directly into cpu could be .
we are talking about a potential paradigm shift in how we deploy and utilize ai .
it is a if we are on the cusp of a technological revolution .
in a way it is comparable to the leap from those bulky mainframe computer to the personal computer we use today .
this is not some niche tech thing .
it is something that could affect everyone who interacts with technology which is pretty much all of u these day .
and remember we are scratching the surface here .
a more developer and organization adopt intel amx we are bound to see even more innovative application and breakthrough emerge .
i can not wait to see what the future hold .
but before we get ahead of ourselves let take a closer look .
at the technical nitty gritty of intel amx and how it work .
welcome back .
i am glad we are getting into the how .
yeah i am ready to dive deeper into those technical detail how this all work .
imagine this. . the cpu is a bustling city with different area specializing in different task .
now intel amx is adding a whole new district devoted entirely to ai .
it is not about making the whole city faster .
it is about having a dedicated zone for ai .
this new district is packed with specialized hardware unit built to handle those complex calculation .
the one we talked about .
yeah you got it .
and these unit they are called tile .
yeah each tile is a team of super efficient mathematician .
i am starting to get the picture .
each one contains an array of processing element optimized for matrix operation they can crunch through massive amount of data simultaneously .
it is having a mini supercomputer inside the main computer .
thats a great way to put it .
and all of this translates to much faster ai model training and deployment .
give me an example .
sure let say you are training a neural network to recognize image .
identifying different type of flower ?
you feed the network ton of image maybe million and it adjusts it parameter based on how it is doing .
and with intel amx these adjustment happen much faster .
because the matrix multiplication involved in that process are handled at lightning speed .
the ai learns way faster .
it is giving the ai a crash course in image recognition but at warp speed .
now thats efficient learning. . and that faster training of course mean faster development of ai application .
developer can experiment more iterate quicker and ultimately bring new ai solution to the market faster .
talking a lot about how intel amx stack up against using separate hardware gpus .
can we dig into that a bit more ?
what are the benefit of having this all integrated directly onto the cpu ?
one of the biggest advantage is reduced latency .
yeah when data ha to travel between the cpu and a separate gpu .
it is having to commute back and forth that take time .
and that back and forth creates bottleneck especially for application where speed is crucial .
selfdriving car .
every millisecond count in those scenario .
with intel amx the data stay put within the cpu ai processing is super fast .
another benefit is simpler deployment .
with separate hardware you need specialized driver and software to manage the communication between the cpu and the gpu. . it get complicated .
yeah but with intel amx everything is built in streamlined .
developer can focus on building those awesome ai application .
and they can move their process .
plus this streamlined approach can also save money .
because organization do not have to invest in separate gpus. . they can leverage the power of intel amx using their existing cpu .
this could democratize ai making it more affordable and accessible .
i think .
it open door for smaller company and researcher who might not have the resource for all that extra hardware .
this is exciting stuff .
but of course with any powerful technology there are also potential risk .
we talked a bit about responsible ai development .
we have to be mindful .
you expand on that a little ?
a ai becomes more powerful and integrated into our life it is crucial to ensure these system are ethical. . ai for good .
we need to address concern about bias transparency and accountability to make sure ai benefit everyone not a select few .
it is a reminder that technology is a tool .
and it is up to u to use it wisely .
weve covered a lot of ground here .
the technical detail the real world application the potential risk and benefit .
what excites me the most is that this technology could usher in a whole new era of ai innovation .
it is a major step towards making ai more powerful efficient and accessible .
and with any technological advancement it is a matter of time before we see it full impact unfold .
got to wait for that .
before we wrap up our deep dive let take a moment to reflect on what all of the all of this could mean for the future of ai and how we interact with technology in the year to come .
i am ready for that .
and we are back for the final part of our deep dive into intel amx .
it is been quite a journey .
weve explored the technical nut and bolt and even imagined some pretty cool real world application .
now it is time to step back and look at the bigger picture .
consider the long term implication .
because it is clear that intel amx is a major step forward in ai processing .
and what doe that mean for the future of ai ?
work at all of this lead u . imagine a world where powerful ai is not limited to those massive data center or research lab .
i where you are going with this .
imagine ai seamlessly woven into our everyday device and experience .
our smartphones car even our home could have the power to run those sophisticated ai model locally .
no more relying solely on the cloud for complex ai task .
weve talked about responsible ai development ensuring fairness transparency and accountability .
a ai becomes more powerful and integrated into our life ethical consideration become even more critical .
it is up to u to guide it development to make sure it truly benefit humanity .
our final thought for today .
a ai processing continues to accelerate and become more accessible what will be the next big breakthrough ?
what uncharted territory will we explore in this everevolving field ?
it is a question that spark the imagination .
maybe well see entirely new form of ai capable of solving problem we can not even comprehend now .
or maybe well reach a point where ai is seamlessly integrated into our life that it becomes almost indistinguishable from human intelligence .
it is a future full of potential and a little bit mindboggling too .
one thing for sure the ai journey is getting started and it is bound to be filled with wonder discovery and of course a healthy dose of responsibility .
this ha been an incredible deep dive into intel amx and i want to thank you for guiding u through this fascinating topic .
the pleasure ha been all mine .
and to all our listener thank you for joining u on this journey .
we hope you gained a deeper understanding of the power and potential of intel amx and it role in shaping the future of ai .
for more indepth coverage of this and other exciting development in the world of technology be sure to visit u at techandainews.com .
if you extrapolate the curve that weve had far ?
we are starting to get to phd level .
and last year we were at undergraduate level and the year before we were at the level of a high school student .
again you can you can quibble with at what task and for what ?
we are still missing modality but those are being added .
computer use wa added .
if a generation ha been added if you eyeball the rate at which these capability are increasing it doe make you think that well get there by two thousand and twenty six or two thousand and twenty seven .
i think there are still world where it doesnt happen in a hundred year .
those world the number of those world is rapidly decreasing .
we are rapidly running out of truly convincing blocker truly compelling reason why this will not happen in the next few year .
the scale up is very quick .
we do this today .
we make a model and then we deploy thousand maybe ten of thousand of instance of it .
i think by the time certainly within two to three year whether we have these super powerful ai or not cluster are going to get to the size where youll be able to deploy million of these .
i am optimistic about meaning .
i worry about economics and the concentration of power .
thats what i worry about more .
the abuse of power and ai increase the amount of power in the world and if you concentrate that power and abuse that power it can do immeasurable damage .
yes it is very frightening .
it is very frightening .
the following is a conversation with dario amadeh ceo of enthropic .
the company that created claude that is currently and often at the top of most llm benchmark leaderboards .
on top of that dario and the enthropic team have been outspoken advocate for taking the top of ai safety very .
and they have continued to publish a lot of fascinating ai research on this and other topic .
i am also joined afterwards by two other brilliant people from enthropic .
first amanda askel who is a researcher working on alignment and fine tuning of claude including the design of claudes character and personality .
a few folk told me she ha probably talked with claude more than any human at enthropic .
she wa definitely a fascinating person to talk to about prompt engineering and practical advice on how to get the best out of claude .
after that chris ola stopped by for a chat .
he one of the pioneer of the field of mechanistic interpretability which is an exciting set of effort that aim to reverse engineer neural network .
to figure out whats going on inside inferring behavior from neural activation pattern inside the network .
this is a very promising approach for keeping future super intelligent ai system safe .
for example by detecting from the activation when the model is trying to deceive the human it is talking to .
this is alex friedman podcast to support it .
please check out our sponsor in the description .
and now dear friend here dario emma day .
let start with a big idea of scaling law and the scaling hypothesis .
what is it ?
what is it ?
history and what wa then today ?
i can only describe it a it a it relates to my own experience but ive been in the ai field for about ten year .
and with something i noticed very early on .
i first joined the ai world when i wa working at baidu with andrewing in late two thousand and fourteen which is almost exactly ten year ago now .
and the first thing we worked on wa speech recognition system .
and in those day i think deep learning wa a new thing .
it had made lot of progress .
but everyone wa always saying we do not have the algorithm we need to succeed .
we are not we are only matching a tiny tiny fraction .
there much we need to discover algorithmically .
we havent found the picture of how to match the human brain .
and when in some way it wa fortunate i wa you can have almost beginner look .
i wa a newcomer to the field .
and i looked at the neural net that we were using for speech the recurrent neural network .
and i said i do not know what if you make a bigger and give them more layer .
and what if you scale up the data along with this ? ?
i saw these a independent dial that you could turn .
and i noticed that the model started to do better and better .
a you gave them more data a you a you made the model larger a you trained them for longer .
and i did not measure thing precisely in those day .
but along with with colleague we very much got the informal sense that the more data and the more compute and the more training you put into these model the better they perform .
and initially my thinking wa hey maybe that is true for speech recognition systems. ?
maybe thats one particular quirk one particular area .
i think it wasnt until two thousand and seventeen when i first saw the result from gptone .
that it clicked for me that language is probably the area in which we can do this .
we can get trillion of word of language data .
we can train on them .
and the model we were trained in those day were tiny .
you could train them on one to eight gpus whereas now we train job on ten of thousand soon going to hundred of thousand of gpus .
and when i saw those two thing together and there were a few people iliasutskiver who youve interviewed who had somewhat similar review ?
he might have been the first one although i think a few people came to similar view around the same time ?
there wa rich substance bitter lessen .
there wa goron wrote about the scaling hypothesis .
but i think somewhere between two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and seventeen wa when it clicked for me when i got conviction that hey we are going to be able to do these incredibly wide cognitive task if we if we scale up the model .
and at every stage of scaling there are always argument .
and when i first heard them honestly i thought probably i am the one who wrong .
and all these all these expert in the field are .
they know the situation better better than i do ?
there the trump key argument about you can get syntactics but you can not get semantics .
there is this idea .
you can make a sentence make sense .
the latest one we have today is we are going to run out of data or the data is in high quality enough for model can not reason .
and each time every time we manage to we manage to either find a way around or scaling is the way around .
sometimes it is one sometimes it is the other .
and i am now at this point i still think it is it is always quite uncertain we have nothing but inductive inference to tell u that the next few year are going to be the next the last ten year .
but but ive seen ive seen the movie enough time .
ive seen the story happen for enough time to believe that probably the scaling is going to continue and that there some magic to it that we havent explained on a theoretical basis yet .
and of course the scaling here is bigger network bigger data bigger compute .
yes all of this .
in particular linear scaling up of bigger network bigger training time and more and more data .
all of these thing almost a chemical reaction .
you have three ingredient in the chemical reaction and you need to linearly scale up the three ingredient .
if you scale up one not the others you run out of the other reagent and the reaction stop .
but if you scale up everything everything in series then the reaction can proceed .
and of course now that you have this empirical science slash art you can apply to other more nuanced thing scaling law applied to interpretability or scaling law applied to post training or seeing how doe this thing scale ?
but the big scaling law i guess the underlying scaling hypothesis ha to do with big network big data lead to intelligence .
yeah weve documented scaling law in lot of domain other than language ?
initially the paper we did that first showed it wa in early two thousand and twenty where we first showed it for language .
there wa then some work late in two thousand and twenty where we showed the same thing for other modality image video text image image to text math they all had the same pattern .
and you are .
now there are other stage post training or there are new type of reasoning model .
and in all of those case that weve measured we see similar type of scaling law .
a bit of a philosophical question but whats your intuition about why bigger is better in term of network size and data size ?
why doe it lead to more intelligent model ?
in my previous career a a biophysicist i did physic undergrad and then biophysics in grad school .
i think back to what i know a a physicist which is much le than what some of my colleague said and then drop it cab in term of expertise and physic .
there this concept called the one over f noise and one over x distribution .
where often if you add up a bunch of natural process you get a gaussian .
if you add up a bunch of differently distributed natural process .
if you if you take a probe and hook it up to a resistor the distribution of the thermal noise and the resistor go a one over the frequency .
it is some natural convergent distribution .
and i think what an amount to is that if you look at a lot of thing that are produced by some natural process that ha a lot of different scale ?
not a gaussian which is narrowly distributed .
but if i look at large and small frog fluctuation that lead to lead to electrical noise they have this decaying one over x distribution .
and now i think of pattern in the physical world ?
if i or in language if i think about the pattern in language there are some simple pattern .
some word are much more common than others the .
and there basic noun verb structure then there the fact that noun and verb have to agree .
they have to coordinate .
and there the higher level sentence structure then there the thematics structure of paragraph .
and the fact that there this regressing structure you can imagine that a you make the network larger first they capture the simple correlation the simple pattern .
and there this long tail of other pattern .
and if that long tail of other pattern is smooth it is with the one over f noise in physical process resistor then you can imagine a you make the network larger it is capturing more and more of that distribution .
and that smoothness get reflected in how the model are at predicting that how they perform .
language is an evolved process ?
we have common word and le common word .
we have common expression and le common expression .
we have idea who shade that are expressed frequently and we have novel idea .
and that process ha ha developed ha evolved with human over million of year .
and the the gas and this is pure speculation would be would be that there is there some long tail distribution of of the distribution of these idea .
there the long tail but also there the height of the hierarchy of concept that you are building up .
the bigger the network presumably you have a higher capacity to exactly .
if you have a small network you only get the common stuff .
if i make it a little bigger it get good at that .
then suddenly it is good at the sentence but it is not good at the paragraph .
and these these rare and more complex pattern get picked up a i add a i add more capacity to the network .
the natural question then is whats the ceiling of this ?
yeah how complicated and complex is the real world .
how much doe this stuff is there to learn ?
i do not think any of u know the answer to that question .
my strong instinct would be that there no ceiling below level of humans. . we human are able to understand these various pattern .
and that that make me think that if we continue to scale up these these these model to develop new method for training them and scaling them up .
that will at least get to the level that weve gotten to with human .
there then a question of how much more is it possible to understand than human do .
how much how much is it possible to be smarter and more perceptive than human .
i would guess the answer ha got to be domain dependent .
and and each person understands only a tiny bit part of it specializes and they are struggling to combine their knowledge with that of with that of other human .
and i have an instinct that there there a lot of room at the top for ai to get smarter .
if i think of something material in the in the physical world or addressing conflict between human or something that .
it may be there only some of these problem are not intractable but much harder .
and and it may be that there only there only you can do it some of these thing with speech recognition there only clear .
i can hear your speech i think in some area there may be ceiling in better very close to what human have done in other area those ceiling may be very far away .
and i think well only find out when we build these system .
there it is very hard to know in advance we can speculate but we can not be sure .
and then some domain the ceiling might have to do with human bureaucracy and thing this a you write about .
yes human fundamentally ha to be part of the loop thats the cause of the ceiling not maybe the limit of the intelligence .
yeah i think in many case in theory technology could change very fast for example all the thing that we might invent with respect to biology .
but remember there there a there a clinical trial system that we have to go through .
and we have to administer these thing to human i think thats a mixture of thing that are unnecessary and bureaucratic and thing that protect the integrity of society and the whole challenge is that it is hard to tell .
it is hard to tell whats going on it is hard to tell which is which my my view is definitely .
i think in term of drug development we my view is that we are too slow and we are too conservative .
if we do hit a limit .
if we do hit a slow down in the scaling law what do you think would be the reason is it compute limited data limited .
i deal limited a few thing now we are talking about hitting the limit before we get to the level of of human and the skill of human .
i think one thats one thats popular today and i think could be a limit that we run into i most of the limit i would bet against it but it is definitely possible .
is we simply run out of data there only much data on the internet and there issue with the quality of the data you can get .
hundred of trillion of word on the internet but a lot of it is is repetitive or it is search engine search engine optimization drivel or maybe the future will even be text generated by ai itself .
and i think there are limit to what to what can be produced in this way that said we and i would guess other company are working on way to make data synthetic .
no ability to play go whatsoever to above human level by playing against itself there wa no example data from human required in the the alpha go zero version of it .
the other direction of course is these reasoning model that do chain of thought and stop to think .
and and reflect on their own thinking in a way thats another synthetic data coupled with reinforcement learning my my guess with one of those method will get around the data limitation or there may be other source of data that are that are available .
we could observe that even if there no problem with data a we start to scale model up they stop getting better it is it is seen to be our reliable observation that theyve gotten better that could stop at some point for reason we do not understand .
optimization method or some new technique we need to to unblock thing ive seen no evidence of that far but if thing were to slow down that perhaps could be one reason .
what about the limit of compute .
meaning the expensive nature of building bigger bigger data center now i think .
most of the frontier model company i would guess are operating roughly one billion dollar scale plus or minus a factor of three those are the model that exist now or being trained now .
i think next year we are going to go to a few billion and then .
and i would guess that it doe happen now if we get to a hundred billion thats still not enough compute thats still not enough scale then either we need even more scale or we need to develop some way of doing it more efficiently if shifting the curve .
i think between all of these one of the reason i am bullish about powerfully i happening fast is that if you extrapolate the next few point on the curve we are very quickly getting towards .
human level ability some of the new model that that we developed some some some reasoning model that have come from other company they are starting to get to what i would call the phd or professional level if you look at their their coding ability .
and the latest model we released son it three.five the new updated version it get something fifty on sweet bench and sweet bench an example of a bunch of .
i think weve seen similar thing in graduate level math physic and biology from model open a eye one .
if we if we continue to extrapolate this in term of skill skill that we have i think if we extrapolate the straight curve within a few year we will get to these model being .
above the the highest professional level in term of human now will that curve continue you point into an ive pointed to a lot of reason what possible reason why that might not happen .
but if the if the extrapolation curve continues that is the trajectory we are on .
anthropic ha several competitor it is interesting get your view of it all open ai google x ai meta what is the take to .
when in the broad sense of when in the space yeah i want to separate out a couple thing and topic and topic mission is to .
try to make this all go and and we have the theory of change called race to the top race to the top is about trying to push .
push the other player to do the thing by setting an example it is not about being the good guy it is about setting thing up that all of u can be the good guy .
ill give a few example of this early in the history of anthropic one of our cofounder chris all up who i believe you are interviewing soon .
he the cofounder the field of mechanistic interpretability which is an attempt to understand whats going on inside ai model .
we had him and one of our early team focused on this area of interpretability which we think is good for making model safe and transparent .
for three or four year that had no commercial application whatsoever it still doesnt today we are doing some early beta with it and probably it will eventually but .
this is a very very long research bat in one in which weve built in public and share our result publicly and and we did this because we think it is a way to make model safer and interesting thing is that .
a weve done this other company have started doing it a in some case because theyve been inspired by it in some case because they are worried that .
soon that there that there interpretability team else elsewhere a and in a way that take away our competitive advantage because it is that .
now others are doing it a but it is good it is good for the broader system and we have to invent some new thing that we are doing that others are not doing a on the hope .
is to bid up bid up the importance of of of doing the thing and it is not it is not about u in particular it is not about having .
one particular good guy other company can do this a if they if they if they join the race to do this thats thats thats the best news ever .
it is it is it is about shaping the incentive to point upward instead of shaping the incentive to point to point downward and we should say this example the field of a mechanistic interpretability .
is a rigorous non handwavy way of doing it a safety .
yeah whats tending that way trying to i think we are still early .
in term of our ability to see thing but ive been surprised at how much weve been able to look inside these system and understand what we see unlike with the scaling law where it feel there some .
law thats driving these model to perform better on on the inside the model are not there no reason why they should be designed for u to understand them they are designed to operate they are designed to work the human brain or human biochemistry .
and a the side effect you also get to see the beauty of these model you get to explore the beautiful nature of large and you on that work through the mech and turb the dimension .
i am amazed at how clean it is been .
i am amazed at thing induction head i am amazed at thing that that we can you sparse auto encoders to find these direction within the network .
we we released this model a a demo is half a joke for a couple day but it wa it wa a illustrative of the method we developed and .
you could you could take the golden gate you could take the model you could ask it about anything be how you could say how is your day anything you asked because this feature wa activated would connect to the golden gate bridge would say .
i am i am feeling relaxed and expansive much the archer of the golden gate bridge or it would masterfully change topic .
yeah the golden gate bridge and integrated there is also sadness to it to to the focus ahead on the golden gate bridge .
i think people quickly fun and love with it .
i think people already miss it because it wa taken down i think after a day somehow these intervention on the model .
where where where where you adjusted to behavior somehow emotionally made it seem more human .
yeah than any other version of the model strong personality strong identity strong personality it ha these obsessive interest .
we can all think of someone who obsessed with something it doe make it feel somehow a bit more human .
let talk about the present let talk about claude this year a lot ha happened in march .
claude three opus on it hiku were released then claude three five sonna in july with an updated version now released and then also claude three five hiku wa released .
can you explain the difference between opus sonna and hiku and how we should think about the different version .
yeah let go back to march when we first released these three model .
our thinking wa different company produce large and small model better and worse model .
we felt that there wa demand both for a powerful model .
when you might be a little bit slower that youd have to pay more for and also for fast cheap model that are a smart a they can be for how fast and cheap .
whenever you want to do some difficult analysis if i i want to write code for instance or i want to i want to brainstorm idea or i want to do creative writing .
i want the powerful model but then there a lot of practical application and a business sense where it is i am interacting with a website .
i i am doing my tax or i am talking to to a legal advisor and i want to analyze a contract or we have plenty of company that are i want to do auto complete on my on my ide or something .
and for all of those thing you want to act fast and you want to use the model very broadly we want to serve that whole spectrum of need .
we ended up with this this poetry theme and whats a short poem it is a high coup and high coup is the small fast cheap model that is wa at the time wa surprisingly surprisingly intelligent for how fast and cheap it wa .
that that wa the original thinking behind it and our our thinking then wa each new generation of model should shift that trade off curve .
when we release sonnet three.five it ha the same roughly the same cost and speed a the sonnet three model but it increased it intelligence the point where it wa smarter than the original opus three model especially for code but but also in general .
and now weve shown result for a high coup three.five and i believe high coup three.five the smallest new model is about a good a opus three the largest old model .
the aim here is to shift the curve and then at some point there going to be an opus three.five .
now every new generation of model ha it own thing they use new data their personality change in way that we try to steer but are not fully able to steer and there never quite that exact equivalence where the only thing you are changing is intelligence .
we always try to improve other thing and some thing change without u knowing or measuring it is it is very much an exact science in many way the manner and personality of these model is more and are then it is a science .
what is the reason for the span of time between say cloud opus three.zero and three.five what is what take that time if you can speak to .
there different there different process there pre training which is the normal language model training and that take a very long time that us these day .
10 ten of thousand sometimes many ten of thousand of gpus or tpus or training or what we use different platform but accelerator chip often often training for month .
10 there then a post training phase where we do reinforcement learning from human feedback a a other kind of reinforcement learning that that phase is getting larger and larger now and often thats le of an exact science it often take effort to get it .
10 the model of the test it with some of our early partner to see how good they are and they are then tested both internally and externally for their safety particularly for catastrophic and autonomy risk .
10 we do internal testing according to our responsible scaling policy which i could talk more about that in detail .
and then we have an agreement with the u and the uk ai safety institute a a other third party tester and specific domain to test the model for what are called .
cbrn risk chemical biological radiological and nuclear which are we do not think that model pose these risk yet but but every new model we want to evaluate to see if we are starting to get close to some of these these these more dangerous .
10 these more dangerous capability those are the phase and then then then it take some time to get the model working in term of inference and want you to in the api there a lot of step to .
10 to making a model work and of course we are always trying to make the process a streamlined a possible we want our safety testing to be rigorous but we want it to be rigorous and .
10 to be automatic to happen a fast a it can without compromising on rigor same with our pretraining process and our post training process .
it is building anything else it is building airplane you want to make them you want to make them safe but you want to make the process streamlined and i think .
and the idea of tension between those is is an important thing and making the model work yeah room around the street i forget who wa saying that and tropical is good tooling .
10 to be able to have a .
10 to be able to have a a efficient low friction interaction with the infrastructure you would be surprised how much of the challenge of .
10 touching these model come down to soft for engineering performance engineering from the outside you might think man we have this you recap break through this movie with the sign we discovered it we figured it out but .
i think all thing even incredible discovery they almost always come down to the detail .
and often super super boring detail i can not speak to whether we have better tooling than other company .
havent been at those other company at least at least not recently but it is certainly something we give a lot of attention to .
i do not know if you can say but from three from cloud three to cloud three five is there any extra pretraining going on ?
a i mostly focus on the posttraining there been leap in performance .
yeah i think at any given stage we are focused on improving everything at once .
naturally their different team each team make progress in a particular area in making a particular segment of the relay race better .
and it is natural that when we make a new model we put all of these thing in at once .
the data you have the preference data you get from rlhf is that applicable ?
is there a way to apply it to newer model ?
a it get trained up ?
yeah preference data from old model sometimes get used for new model .
although of course it performs somewhat better when it is trained on the new model .
note that we have this constitutional ai method such that we do not only use preference data we there also a posttraining process where we train the model against itself .
and there new type of posttraining the model and it is selfinterviewed every day .
it is not rlhf it is a bunch of other method a . posttraining i think is becoming more and more sophisticated .
what explains the big leap in performance for the new sonic thirty five ?
at least in the programming side .
if this is a good place to talk about benchmark what is not going to get better ?
the number one up .
but id program but i also love programming and i clawed thirty five through cursor what i use to assist me in programming .
and at least experimentially and it is gotten smarter at programming .
what doe it take to get it smarter ?
we observe that a by the way .
there were a couple very strong engineer here at anthropic who all previous code model both produced by u then produced by all the other company hadnt been useful to them .
they said maybe this is useful to beginner it is not useful to me .
but sonic three.five the original one for the first time they said my god this helped me with something that it would have taken the hour to do .
this is the first model that wa saved me time .
again the water line is rising .
and then i think the new sonic ha been even better .
in term of what it take ill say it is been across the board .
it is in the pretraining it is in the posttraining .
it is in various evaluation that we do .
weve observed this a . and if we go into the detail of the benchmark sweet bench is since your programmer youll be familiar with pull request and pull request a topic unit of work .
you could say i am implementing one thing .
and sweet bench give you a realworld situation where the code base is in a current state .
and i am trying to implement something thats described in the scribed in language .
we have internal benchmark where we measure the same thing .
and you say give the model free reign to do anything run anything edit anything how is it able to complete these task .
and it is that benchmark thats gone from it .
it can do it three of the time to it can do it about fifty of the time .
i do believe that if we get you can gain benchmark but i think if we get to one hundred on that benchmark and in a way that is not overtrained or game for that particular benchmark probably represent a real and serious increase in programming programming ability .
and i would suspect that if we can get to ninety nine .
that it will represent ability to autonomously do a significant fraction of software engineering task .
when is cloud opus three.five coming up ?
not giving you an exact date but there a far a we know the plan is still to have a cloud three.five opus .
there wa some game that wa delayed fifteen year .
is that duke nukem forever ?
and i think gta is not releasing trailer .
it is only been three month since we released the first on it .
yeah it is incredible pace of release .
but it tell you about the pace .
the expectation for one thing is you are gon na come out .
what about forty ?
how do you think about a these model get bigger and bigger about versioning ?
and also versioning in general why sonic three.five updated with the date ?
why not ?
sonic three.six which i love .
the naming is an interesting challenge here ?
because i think a year ago most of the model wa pretraining .
and you could start from the beginning and say we are gon na have model of different size .
we are gon na train them all together .
and well have a family of naming scheme .
and then well put some new magic into them .
and then well have the next generation .
the trouble start already when some of them take a lot longer than other to train ?
that already mess up your time time a little bit .
but a you make big improvement in a you make big improvement in pretraining then you suddenly notice i can make better pretrained model and that doesnt take very long to do .
and but clearly it ha the same size and shape of previous model .
i think those two together a with the timing issue any scheme you come up with that the reality tends to frustrate that scheme ?
ten tends to break out of the break out of the scheme .
it is not software you can say this is three.seven this is three.eight .
no you have model with different tradeoff .
you can change some thing in your model .
you can train you can change other thing .
some are faster and slower in front .
some have to be more expensive .
some have to be le expensive .
and i think all the company have struggled with this .
i think we did very i think we were in a good position in term of naming when we had hiku sonnet and chris .
we are trying to maintain it but it is not it is not perfect .
well well try and get back to this simplicity but it it it the the nature of the field .
i feel no one figured out naming .
it is somehow a different paradigm from normal software .
and and we we not of the company have been perfect at it .
and it is something we struggle with surprisingly much relative to how relative to how trivial it is for the the the the grand science of training the model .
from the user side the user experience of the updated sonnet thirty five is different than the previous june two thousand and twenty four sonnet thirty five .
it would be nice to come up with some labeling that embodies that .
because people talk about sonnet thirty five but now there a different one .
and how do you refer to the previous one and the new one ?
and it it when there a distinct improvement it make conversation about it challenging .
i definitely think this question of there are lot of property of the model that are not reflected in the benchmark .
i think thats thats definitely the case and everyone agrees .
and not all of them are capability .
some of them are model can be polite or brusk .
they can be very reactive or they can ask you question .
they can have what what feel a warm personality or a cold personality .
they can be boring or they can be very distinctive golden gate cloud wa .
and we have a whole we have a whole team focused on i think we call it cloud character amanda lead that team and well well talk to you about that .
but it is still a very inexact science .
and and and often we find that model have property that we are not aware of .
the the fact of the matter is that you can talk to a model tenzero time and there are some behavior you might not see .
with a human ?
i can know someone for a few month and not know that they have a certain skill or not know that there a certain side to them .
the normative question is also super interesting .
i got ta ask you a question from reddit .
from reddit .
there there a fascinating to me at least it is a psychological social phenomenon .
where people report that claude ha gotten dumb enough for them over time .
and the question is doe the user complaint about the dumbing down of claude thirty five son at hold any water ?
are these anecdotal report it social phenomenon or did claude is there any case where claude would get dumber ?
this doesnt apply this is not about claude .
i believe this i believe ive seen these complaint for every foundation model produced by major company .
people said this about gpt4 they said it about gpt4 turbo .
couple thing .
one the actual weight of the model ?
the actual brain of the model that doe not change unless we introduce a new model .
there therere a number of reason why it would not make sense practically to be randomly substituting in substituting in new version of the model .
it is difficult from an inference perspective and it is hard to control all the consequence of changing the weight of the model .
let say you wanted to find two in the model to be i do not know to say certainly le which an old version of son that used to do .
you end up changing one hundred thing a . we have a whole process for it and we have a whole process for modifying the model .
we do a bunch of testing on it .
we do a bunch of we do a bunch of user testing in early customer .
we both have never changed the weight of the model without telling anyone .
and it wouldnt certainly in the current setup it would not make sense to do that .
now there are a couple thing that we do occasionally do .
one is sometimes we run ab test .
but those are typically very close to when a model is being released and for a very small fraction of time .
the day before the new son at three.five i agree .
we should have had better name .
it is a clunky to refer to it .
there were some comment from people that it is gotten a lot better .
and thats because a fraction were exposed to an ab test for those one or two day .
the other is that occasionally the system prompt will change .
the system prompt can have some effect although it is unlikely to dumb down model .
it is unlikely to make them dumber .
and weve seen that while these two thing which i am listing to be very complete happen relatively happen quite infrequently .
the complaint about for u and for other model company about the model change the model is not good at this .
the model got more censored .
the model wa dumbed down .
those complaint are constant .
and i do not want to say people are managing to do anything but the model are for the most part not changing .
if i were to offer a theory i think it relates to one of the thing i said before which is that model have many are very complex and have many aspect to them .
and often if i ask them a model a question if i am do task act versus can you do task act ?
the model might respond in different way .
and there are all kind of subtle thing that you can change about the way you interact with the model that can give you very different result .
to be clear this itself is a failing by u and by the other model provider that the model are offensive to small change in word .
it is yet another way in which the science of how these model work is very poorly developed .
and if i go to sleep one night and i wa talking the model in a certain way and i slightly change the phrasing of how i talk to the model i could get different result .
thats one possible way .
the other thing is man it is hard to quantify this stuff .
it is hard to quantify this stuff .
i think people are very excited by new model when they come out and then a time go on they become very aware of the limitation .
that may be another effect but thats all a very longrended way of saying for the most part with some fairly narrow exception the model are not changing .
i think there is a psychological effect .
you start getting used to it the baseline raise .
when people have first gotten wifi on airplane it is a major ... a major ... yeah and then ... now i want to ... get this thing to work .
this is such a piece of crap .
these are to have the conspiracy theory that they are making wifi slower and slower .
this is probably something ill talk to amanda much more about but another reddit question .
one will plot stuff trying to be my pure a tannical grandmother imposing it moral worldview on me a a paying customer .
and also what doe this ecology behind making cloud overly apologetic ?
this report about the experience at different angle in the frustration .
it ha to do with the character .
yeah a couple point on this first .
one is thing that people say on reddit and twitter or actual wherever it is .
there a huge distribution shift between the stuff that people complain loudly about on social medium and what statistically user care about and that drive people to use the model .
people are frustrated with thing the model not writing out all the code or the model .
not being a good at code a it could be even though it is the best model in the world on code .
i think the majority of thing are about that .
but certainly a vocal minority are raised these concern ?
our frustrated by the model refusing thing that shouldnt refuse or apologizing too much .
or having these annoying verbal tick .
the second caveat and i want to say this super clearly because i think it is some people do not know what others know it but forget it .
it is very difficult to control across the board how the model behave .
you can not reach in there and say i want the model to apologize le .
you can do that .
you can include trading data that say the model should apologize le .
but then in some other situation they end up being super rude or overconfident in a way thats misleading people .
there are all these tradeoff .
for example another thing is if there wa a period during which model ours and i think others a were two verbose ?
they would repeat themselves .
they would say too much .
you can cut down on the verbosity by penalizing the model for talking for too long .
what happens when you do that if you do it in a crude way is when the model are coding sometimes theyll say rest of the code go here ?
because theyve learned that thats a way to economize and that they see it and then that leaf the model to be called lazy encoding where they are you can finish the rest of it .
you can there this whackamo aspect where you push on one thing and these other thing start to move a that you may not even notice or measure .
and one of the reason that i care much about grand alignment of the ai system in the future is these system are quite unpredictable .
they are quite hard to steer in control .
and this version we are seeing today of you may want to think better it make another thing worse .
i think thats thats a present day analog of future control problem in ai system that we can start to study today. ?
i think that that difficulty in steering the behavior and making sure that if we push an ai system in one direction it doesnt push in another direction in some other way that we did not want .
i think thats an early sign of thing to come .
and if we can do a good job of solving this problem ?
of you ask the model to to make and distribute smallpox and it say no but it is willing to help you in your graduate level of biology class .
how do we get both of those thing at once ?
it is hard .
it is very easy to go to one side or the other .
and it is a multidimensional problem .
and i i think these question of shaping the model personality .
i think they are very hard .
i think we havent done perfectly on them .
i think weve done the best of all the ai company but still far from perfect .
and i think if we can get this if we can control the control the false positive and false negative in this this is very controlled present day environment will be much better at doing it for the future .
when our worry is the model be super autonomous .
will they be able to make very dangerous thing .
will they be able to autonomously build whole company and are those company aligned .
i i think of this this present task a both vaccine but also good practice for the future .
whats the current best way of gathering user feedback ?
not anecdotal data but large scale data about pain point or the opposite of pain point positive thing .
is it internal testing ?
is it yeah specific group testing a b testing ?
what work ?
typically well have internal model bashings where all of anthropic and tropical is almost one thousand people .
people try and break the model .
they try and interact with it various way .
we have a suite of evalues for it is the model refusing in way that it couldnt .
i think we even had a certainly eval because our our again one point model had this problem where it had this annoying tick where it would respond to a wide range of question by saying certainly i can help you with that .
certainly i would be happy to do that .
certainly this is correct .
and we had a certainly eval which is how often doe the model say certainly ?
but look this is a whackamole .
what if it switch from certainly to definitely ?
every time we add a new eval and we are always evaluating for all the old thing .
we have hundred of these evaluation but we find that there no substitute for human interacting with it .
and it is very much the ordinary product development process .
we have hundred of people within anthropic bash the model then we do then we do external ab test .
sometimes well run test with contractor .
we pay contractor to interact with the model .
you put all of these thing together and it is still not perfect .
you still see behavior that you do not quite want to see ?
you still see the model refusing thing that it doesnt make sense to refuse .
but i i think trying to try and to solve this challenge ?
trying to stop the model from doing genuinely bad thing that know what everyone agrees it shouldnt do ?
everyone everyone everyone everyone agrees that the model shouldnt talk about i do not know child abuse material ?
everyone agrees the model shouldnt do that .
but but at the same time that it doesnt refuse in these dumb and stupid way i think i think drawing that line a finely a possible approaching perfectly is still a challenge .
and we are getting better at it every day but there there a lot to be solved .
and again i would point to that a a an indicator of a challenge ahead in term of steering much more powerful model .
do you think claude four.zero is ever coming up ?
i do not want to commit to any naming scheme because if i say if i say here we are going to have claude four next year and then and then then we decide that we should start over because there a new type of model .
i would expect an normal course of business that claude four would come after claude three.five but but you never know in this wacky field ?
but this idea of scaling is continuing .
scaling is continuing .
there there will definitely be more powerful model coming from u in the model that exist today .
that is that is certain or if there if there are not weve weve deeply failed a a company. . can you explain the responsible scaling policy and the ai safety level standard ai level ?
a much a i am excited about the benefit of these model and we know well talk about that if we talk about machine of loving grace i am i am worried about the risk and i continue to be worried about the risk .
no one should think that machine of loving grace wa me me saying i am no longer worried about the risk of these model .
i think they are two side of the same coin .
the power of the model and their ability to solve all these problem in biology neuroscience economic development governance and peace large part of the economy those those come with risk a with great power come great responsibility ?
thats the the the the two are the two are paired thing that are powerful can do good thing and they can do bad thing .
these are misuse of the model in domain cyber bio radiological nuclear thing that could that could harm or even kill thousand even million of people if they go wrong .
let say let say i am someone who i have a phd in this field i have a paying job .
there much to lose .
why do i want to even though assuming i am completely evil which which most people are not .
why why why would such a person risk their risk their risk their life risk their their legacy their reputation to do something truly truly evil .
if we had a lot more people that the world would be a much more dangerous place .
and my my worry is that by being a a much more intelligent agent ai could break that correlation .
and i i do have serious worry about that .
i believe we can prevent those worry but i think a a counterpoint to machine of loving grace i want to say that this is that i this still serious risk .
are they are they doing what we want them to do ?
it is very difficult to even understand and detail what they are doing let alone let alone control it .
if you fix one thing it creates other problem .
we are getting better and better at solving this .
i do not think this is an unsolvable problem .
i think this is this is a science the safety of airplane or the safety of car or the safety of drug .
i i do not think there any big thing we are missing .
i think we need to get better at controlling these model .
and these are these are the two risk i am worried about .
and our responsible scaling plan which all recognizes a very longwinded answer to your question our our responsible scaling plan is designed to address these two type of risk .
and every time we develop a new model we test it for it ability to do both of these bad thing .
if i were to back up a little bit i think we have it i think we have an interesting dilemma with ai system where they are not yet powerful enough to present these catastrophe .
i do not know that i do not know theyll ever present prevent these catastrophe .
it is possible they will not .
but the the case for work the case for risk is strong enough that we should we should act now .
and they are getting better very very fast. ?
i i testified in the senate that we might have serious bio risk within two to three year .
that wa about a year ago .
thing have preceded preceded a pace .
we have this thing where it is it is it is surprisingly hard to to address these risk because they are not here today .
they do not exist .
they are light ghost .
but they are coming at u fast because the model were improving fast .
how do you deal with something thats not here today doesnt exist but is coming at u very fast .
the solution we came up with for that in collaboration with people the organization meter and paul cristiano is what what what you need for that are you need test to tell you when the risk is getting close ?
you need an early warning system .
and and every time we have a new model we test it for it capability to do these cbrn task a a testing it for how capable it is of doing task autonomously on it own .
and that thats threshold is important for a bunch of other way .
and and what do we then do with these task ?
the rsp develops what weve called an ifthen structure which is if the model pas of certain capability then we impose a certain set of safety and security requirement on them .
today model are whats called asl2 .
model that were asl1 is for system that manifestly do not pose any risk of autonomy or misuse .
for example a chess plane bought deep blue would be asl1 .
it is manifestly the case that you can not use deep blue for anything other than chess .
it wa designed for chess .
no one going to use it to to conduct a masterful cyber attack or to run wild and take over the world .
in fact sometimes they do provide information but not above and beyond a search engine but not in a way that can be stitched together not in a way that end to end is dangerous enough .
asl3 is going to be the point at which the model are hopeful enough to enhance the capability of nonstate actors. . state actor can already do a lot of unfortunately to a high level of proficiency a lot of these very dangerous and destructive thing .
the difference is that nonstate actor are not capable of it .
asl4 getting to the point where these model could it could enhance the capability of a already knowledgeable state actor and or become the main source of such a risk .
if you wanted to engage in such a risk the main way you would do it is through a model .
and then i think asl4 on the autonomy side it is some some amount of acceleration in ai research capability with it within ai model .
and then asl5 is where we would get to the model that are truly capable .
it could exceed humanity and there are ability to do any of these task .
and the point of the ifthen structure commitment is to say look i do not know ive been working with these model for many year and ive been worried about risk for many year .
it is dangerous to cry wolf .
it is dangerous to say this model is risky and people look at it and they say this is manifestly not dangerous .
again it is the the delicacy of the risk is not here today but it is coming out a fast .
how do you deal with that ?
it is vexing to a risk planner to deal with it .
and this if then structure say look we do not want to antagonize a bunch of people .
we do not want to harm our own our our our own ability to have a place in the conversation by imposing these these very honorists burden on model that are not dangerous today .
the if then the trigger commitment is a way to deal with this .
it say you clamped down hard when you can show that the model is dangerous .
and of course what ha to come with that is enough of a buffer threshold that you can you are you are you are you are not at high risk of missing the danger .
it is not a perfect framework .
what do you think that timeline for sl3 is where several of the trigger are fired and what do you think the timeline is for sl4 ?
yeah that is hotly debated within the company .
we are working actively to prepare asl3 security security measure a a asl3 deployment measure .
i am not going to go into detail but weve made weve made a lot of progress on both and we are prepared to be i think ready quite soon .
i would not be surprised at all if we hit asl3 next year .
there wa some concern that we might even hit it this year thats still thats still possible that could still happen .
it is very hard to say but i would be very very surprised if it wa two thousand and thirty .
i think it is much sooner than that .
there a protocol for detecting it if then and then there protocol for how to respond to it .
yes how difficult is the second the latter ?
yeah i think for asl3 it is primarily about security and about filter on the model relating to a very narrow set of area when we deploy the model because asl3 the model is not autonomous yet .
and you do not have to worry about the model itself behaving in a bad way even when it is deployed internally .
i think the asl3 measure are i will not say straight forward .
they are they are rigorous but they are easier to reason about .
i think once we get to asl4 we start to have worry about the model being smart enough that they might sandbag test .
they might not tell the truth about test .
we had some result came out about sleep region and there wa a more recent paper about can the model mislead attempt to sandbag their own ability .
they present themselves a being le capable than they are .
and i think with asl4 there going to be an important component of using other thing than interacting with the model .
for example interpretability or hidden in chain of thought .
where you have to look inside the model and verify via some other mechanism that is not a easily corrupted a what the model say that the model indeed ha some property .
one of the property of the rsp is that we do not specify asl4 until weve hit asl3 .
and i think thats proven to be a wise decision because even with asl3 it again it is hard to know this stuff in detail .
and we want to take a much time a we can possibly take to get these thing .
for asl3 the bad act will be the human .
there a little bit more for asl4 it is both .
i think it is both .
deception and thats where mechanistic interpretability come into play .
and hopefully the technique used for that are not made accessible to the model .
yeah of course you can hook up the mechanistic interpretability to the model itself .
but then youve lost it a reliable indicator of the model state .
there are a bunch of exotic way you can think of that it might also not be reliable .
if the model get smart enough that it can jump computer and read the code where you are looking at it internal state weve thought about some of those .
i think they are exotic enough .
there are way for vendor them unlikely .
but yeah generally you want to you want to preserve mechanistic interpretability a a verification set or test set that separate from the training process of the model .
see i think a these model become better and better conversation and become smarter social engineering becomes a threat to because they they can start being very convincing to the engineer and side company .
computer use there also an analysis within the sandbox of cloud.ai itself but let talk about computer use .
that seems to me super exciting that you can give cloud a task and it take a bunch of action figure it out and it is access to the your computer through screenshots .
can you explain how that work ?
and where thats headed .
yeah it is relatively simple .
cloud ha had for a long time since since cloud three back in march the ability to analyze image and respond to them with text .
the only new thing we added is those image can be screenshots of a computer .
and in response we train the model to give a location on the screen where you can click and or button on the keyboard you can press in order to take action .
and it turn out that with not all that much additional training the model can get quite good at that task .
it is a good example of generalization .
people sometimes say if you get to lower for a bit you are halfway to anywhere ?
because of how much it take to escape the gravity .
if you have a strong free train model i feel you are halfway to anywhere in term of in term of the intelligent space .
and it did not take all that much to get to get cloud to do this .
and you can set that in a loop give the model screen shot tell it what to click on give it the next screen shot tell it what to click on .
and that turn into a full almost 3d video interaction of the model .
and it is able to do all of these tasks. ?
we showed these demo were it is able to fill out spreadsheet to table to interact with a website .
it is able to it is able to open all kind of program different operating system window linux mac .
i think all of that is very exciting .
i will say while in theory there nothing you could do there that you couldnt have done through giving the model the api to drive the computer screen .
this lower the barrier .
and there there a lot of folk who who either are are not in a position to interact with those apis or take them a long time to do .
it is the screen is a universal interface thats a lot easier to interact with .
and i expect over time this is going to lower a bunch of barrier .
now honestly the current model ha there it leaf a lot still to be desired .
and we were we were honest about that in the blog. ?
and we we were careful to warn people hey this thing is not you can not leave this thing to run on your computer for minute and minute .
you got to give this thing boundary and guard rail .
and i think thats one of the reason we released it first in an api form rather than this this hand hand the consumer and and give it control of their of their of their computer .
but but i definitely feel that it is important to get these capability out there a model get more powerful .
we are going to have to grapple with how do we use these capability safely ?
how do we prevent them from being abused ?
and i think i think releasing the model while while the capability are are still are still limited is is very helpful in term of in term of doing that .
i think since it is been released a number of customer i think our rapid it wa maybe wa maybe one of the the most quickest quickest quickest to deploy thing have have made use of it in various way .
people have hooked up demo for window dash top mac linux linux machine .
i think a with a with anything else it it it it come with new exciting ability .
and then then then then then then with those new exciting ability we have to think about how to how to make the model say reliable do what human want them to do .
to the same it is the same story for everything ?
same thing it is that same tension .
but but the possibility of use case here is the the range is incredible .
how much to make it work in the future ?
how much do you have to especially go beyond whats the pretrained model doing ?
do more posttraining rlhf or supervisor finan2 and eur synthetic data for the agent ?
yeah i think speaking at a high level it is our intention to keep investing a lot in making the model better .
i think i think we look at look at some of the some of the bench marx were previous model were could do it six percent of the time .
and now our model had to do it fourteen or twenty two percent of the time .
and yeah we want to get up to the human level reliability of eighty nine percent anywhere else ?
we are on the same curve that we were on with sweenbent where i think i would guess a year from now the model can do this very very reliably but you got to start somewhere .
he thinking it is possible to get to the human level ninety percent doing the same thing you are doing now or is it ha to be special for computer ?
but this is giving the power of action to claw and you could do a lot of powerful thing but you could do a lot of damage also .
no and weve been very aware of that .
look my view is computer use is not a fundamentally new capability the cbrn or autonomy capability are .
it is more it open the aperture for the model to use and apply it existing ability .
going forward certainly this modality of interaction is something we have tested for and that we will continue to test for an rsp going forward .
i think it is probably better to have to learn and explore this capability before the model is super super capable .
yeah there a lot of interesting attack prompt injection because now youve widened the aperture you can prompt inject through stuff on screen .
if this becomes more and more useful then there more more benefit to inject inject stuff into the model .
if it go to certain webpage it could be harmless stuff advertisement or it could be harmful stuff. . yeah weve thought a lot about thing spam capture mass camp .
there all every every if once you could all tell you if youve invented a new technology not necessarily the biggest misuse but the the first misuse youll see scam petty scam .
youll it is it is a thing is all people scamming each other .
it is this it is this thing is all this time .
and and it is every time you got to deal with it it is almost silly to say but it is true bot and spam in general is the thing is it is more and more intelligent .
yes it is there are a lot of i said there are a lot of petty criminal in the world .
and and and it is every new technology is a new way for petty petty criminal to do something something stupid and malicious .
is there any idea about sandboxing it ?
how difficult is the sandboxing task ?
yeah we sandboxed during training .
for example during training we did not expose the model to the internet .
i think thats probably a bad idea during training because the model can be changing it policy it can be changing what it is doing and it is having an effect in the real world .
in term of deploying the model it depends in the application .
sometimes you want the model to do something in the real world but of course you can always put guardrail on the outside ?
you can say this model not going to move data from my model not going to move any file from my computer or my web server to anywhere else .
and there we need to think about mechanistic interpretability about if we are going to have a sandbox it would need to be a mathematically approval sandbox thats a whole different world than what we are dealing with with the model today .
yeah the science of building a box from which asl4 asl4 system can not escape .
i think it is probably not the approach .
i think i think containing bad model is much worse solution than having good model .
let me ask about regulation .
whats the role of regulation in keeping asl safe ?
for example he described california ai regulation bill sb one thousand and forty seven that wa ultimately vetoed by the governor .
what are the pro and con of this bill ?
yeah we ended up making some suggestion to the bill and then some of those were adopted and we felt i think quite positively quite positively about about the bill by the end of that .
it did still have some downside and of course of course you got vetoed .
i think at a high level i think some of the key idea behind the bill are i would say similar to idea behind our rsps .
and i think it is very important that some jurisdiction whether it is california or the federal government and or other country and other state pass some regulation this .
and i can talk through why i think thats important .
i feel good about our rsp .
it is not perfect .
but one there are still some company that do not have rsp mechanism openai google did adopt these mechanism a couple month after after andthropic did .
but there are other company out there that do not have these mechanism at all .
and if some company adopt these mechanism and others do not it is going to create a situation where some of these danger have the property that it doesnt matter if three out of five of the company are being safe .
if the other two are being are being unsafe it creates this negative externality .
and i think the lack of uniformity is not fair to those of u who have put a lot of effort into being very thoughtful about these procedure .
the second thing is i do not think you can trust these company to adhere to these voluntary plan in their own. . i to think that anthropic will we do everything we can that we will our rsp is checked by our longterm benefit trust .
we do everything we can to to adhere to our own rsp .
but you hear lot of thing about various company saying they said they would do they said they would give this much compute and they did not they said they would do this thing and they did not .
i do not think it make sense to litigate particular thing that company have done .
but i think this broad principle that if there nothing watching over them there nothing watching over u a an industry there no guarantee that well do the thing and the stake are very high .
and i think it is i think it is important to have a uniform standard that that that that that everyone follows .
and to make sure that simply that the industry doe what a majority of the industry ha already said it is important and ha already said that they definitely will do. . some people i think there there a class of people who are against regulation on principle .
i understand where that come from .
if you go to europe and something gdpr some of the other stuff that that that that that theyve done some of it is good .
but but some of it is unnecessarily burdensome .
and i think it is fair to say ha slowed ha slowed innovation .
and i understand where people are coming from on prior .
i understand why people come from start from that start from that position .
but but again i think ai is different .
if we go to the very serious risk of autonomy and misuse that that i talked about a a few minute ago i think that those are unusual and they warrant an unusually strong response .
and i think it is very important .
again we need something that everyone can get behind .
i think one of the issue with sb one thousand and forty seven especially the original version of it wa it had a bunch of the structure of rsps .
but it also had a bunch of stuff that wa either a clunky or that that that would have created a bunch of burden a bunch of hassle .
and might even have missed the target in term of addressing the risk .
you do not hear about it on twitter .
you hear about people are cheering for any regulation .
and then the folk who are against make up these often quite intellectually dishonest argument about how itll make u move away from california bill doesnt apply if you are headquarter in california bill only applies if you do business in california .
or that it would damage the open source ecosystem or that it would it would cause all of these thing .
i think those were mostly nonsense but there are better argument against regulation .
there one guy dean ball who i think a very scholarly analyst who look at what happens when a regulation is put in place and way that they can get a life of their own or how they can be poorly designed .
and our interest ha always been we do think there should be regulation in this space .
but we want to be an actor who make sure that that that that regulation is something thats surgical thats targeted at the serious risk .
and it is something people can comply with .
because something i think the advocate of regulation do not understand a a they could is if we get something in place that is thats poorly targeted that waste a bunch of people time .
whats going to happen is people are going to say see the safety risk there this is this is nonsense .
i i had to hire ten lawyer to to fill out all these forum .
i had to run all of these test for something that wa clearly not dangerous .
and after six month of that there will be there will be a groundswell .
and well end up with a durable consensus against regulation .
and the i think the worst enemy of those who want real accountability is badly designed regulation .
and and this is if there one thing i could say to the advocate it would be that i want them to understand this dynamic better .
and we need to be careful .
and we need to talk to people who have who have experience seeing how regulation play out in practice .
and and the people who have seen that understand to be very careful .
if this wa some lesser issue i might be against regulation at all .
but what what i want the opponent to understand is is that the underlying issue are serious .
they are they are not they are not something that i or the other company are making up because of regulatory capture .
they are not scifi fantasy .
they are not they are not any of these thing .
every every time we have a new model every few month we measure the behavior of these model .
and they are getting better and better at these concerning task a they are getting better and better at good valuable economically useful task .
and i i i i would love it if some of the former i think sb one thousand and forty seven wa very polarizing .
i would love it if some of the most reasonable opponent and some of the most reasonable proponent would sit down together .
and i think i think that the different the different ai company and thropic wa the only ai company that felt positively in a very detailed way .
i think elon tweeted tweeted briefly something positive .
but some of the some of the big one google openai meta microsoft were were pretty strong staunchly against .
and and i think for for whatever reason that thing got too polarized and those two group did not get to sit down in the way that they should .
and and i feel i feel urgency .
i think we need to do something in two thousand and twenty five .
if we get to the end of two thousand and twenty five and we still done nothing about this then i am going to be worried .
i am not i am not worried yet because again the risk are not here yet but but i think time is running short .
and come up with something surgically you said .
and we need to get we need to get away from this this intense prosafety versus intense antiregulatory rhetoric .
it is turned into these these flame war on twitter .
and nothing good is going to come with that .
there a lot of curiosity about the different player in the game .
one of the ogs is openai .
you have had several year of experience at openai .
whats your story in history there ?
yeah i wa at openai for roughly five year .
for the last i think it wa a couple year i wa vice president of research there .
probably myself and iliusuits giver were the one who set the set the research direction around two thousand and sixteen or two thousand and seventeen .
i first started to believe in or at least confirm my belief in the scaling hypothesis when ilius famously said to me the thing you need to understand about these model is they want to learn .
the model want to learn .
and and again sometimes there are these one sentence these zen cone that you hear them and you are that explains everything .
that explains a thousand thing that ive seen .
and then i i ever after i had this visualization my head of you optimize the model in the way .
you point the model in the way .
they want to learn .
they want to solve the problem .
regardless of what the problem is .
get out of their way .
get out of their way .
yeah do not impose your own idea about how they should learn .
and this wa the same thing a rich sutton put out in the bitter lesson or gurn put out in the scaling hypothesis .
i think generally the dynamic wa i got i got this inspiration from from from from from ilian from others folk alicrad fridge who did the the original g p t one .
and then ran hard with it .
me and my collaborator on gpt two gpt three are all from human feedback which wa an attempt to deal with the early safety and durability .
thing debate and amplification heavy on interpretability .
why do you leave ?
why said to leave ?
the first one i think openai wa wa getting wa getting on board with .
and look there were many many discussion about should the or should the company do this the company do that ?
there a bunch of misinformation out there .
people say we left because we did not the deal with microsoft .
false although it wa a lot of discussion a lot of question about exactly how we do the deal with microsoft .
we left because we did not commercialization .
thats not true .
we built gpd3 which wa the model that wa commercialized .
i wa involved in commercialization .
it is it is more again about how do you do it ?
civilization is going down this path to very powerful ai .
whats the way to do it that is cautious straightforward honest that build trust in the organization and individual how do we get from here to there ?
and how do we have a real vision for how to get it ?
how can safety not be some thing we say because it help with recruiting ?
and i think i think at the end of the day if you have a vision for that forget about anyone el vision .
i do not want to talk about anyone el vision if you have a vision for how to do it you should go off and you should do that vision .
it is incredibly unproductive to try and argue with someone el vision .
you might think they are not doing it the way .
you might think they are they are dishonest .
who know maybe you are maybe you are not .
but what you should do is you should take some people you trust and you should go off together and you should make your vision happen .
and the fact that you were doing it especially the fact that you are doing it better than they are cause them to change their behavior in a much more compelling way than if they are your bos and you are arguing with them .
i i do not know how to be any more specific about it than that .
but i think it is generally very unproductive to try and get someone el vision to look your vision .
it is much more productive to go off and do a clean experiment and say this is our vision this is how this is how we are going to do thing .
your choice is you can you can ignore u you can reject what we are doing or you can you can start to become more u and imitation is the sincerest form of flattery .
and that that that play out in the behavior of customer that pay out in the behavior of the public that play out in the behavior of where people choose to work .
and again again at the end it is it is not about one company winning or another company winning .
if we are another company or engaging in some practice that people find genuinely appealing .
and i want it to be in substance not in appearance .
and i think i think researcher are sophisticated and they will get substance .
and then other company start copying that practice and they win because they copied that practice .
thats great .
thats success .
thats the race to the top .
it doesnt matter who win in the end a long a everyone is copying everyone el good practices. ?
one way i think of it is the thing we are all afraid of is the race to the bottom. ?
and the race to the bottom doesnt matter who win because we all lose. ?
in the most extreme world we make this autonomous ai that the robot and slave u or whatever. ?
thats half joking but that that is the most extreme thing that could happen .
then then it doesnt matter which company wa ahead .
if instead you create a race to the top where people are competing to engage in good in good practice .
then at the end of the day it doesnt matter who end up winning .
it doesnt even matter who started the race to the top .
the point is not to be virtuous .
the point is to get the system into a better equilibrium than it wa before .
and and individual company can play some role in doing this .
individual company can can help to start it can help to accelerate it .
and frankly i think individual at other company have done this a . ?
the individual that when we put out an rsp react by pushing harder to get something similar done get something similar done at at at other company .
sometimes other company do something thats we are it is a good practice .
we think we think thats good .
we should adopt it too .
the only difference is i think we are we try to be more forwardbleaning .
we try to adopt more of these practice first and adopt them more quickly when others invent them .
but i think this dynamic is what we should be pointing at .
and that i think i think it abstract away the question of which company winning who trust who i think all these all these question of drama are are profoundly uninteresting .
and the thing that matter is the ecosystem that we all operate in and how to make that ecosystem better because that constrains all the player .
and in thropock is this clean experiment built on a foundation of what concretely aict should look .
we are look i am sure weve made plenty of mistake along the way .
the perfect organization doesnt exist .
it ha to deal with the the imperfection of a thousand employee .
it ha to deal with the imperfection of our leader including me .
it ha to deal with the imperfection of the people weve put weve put to oversee the imperfection of the of the leader the the board and the longterm benefit trust .
it is it is all it is all a set of imperfect people trying to aim imperfectly at some ideal that will never perfectly be achieved .
thats what you sign up for .
thats what it will always be .
but imperfect doesnt mean you give up .
there better and there worse .
and hopefully hopefully we can begin to build we can do enough that we can begin to build some practice that the whole industry engages in .
and then my guess is that multiple of these company will be successful .
and tropical will be successful .
these other company once ive been at the past will also be successful .
and some will be more successful than others .
thats le important than again that we we align the incentive of the industry .
and that happens partly through the race to the top partly through thing rsp partly through again selected surgical regulation .
you said talent density beat talent mass .
can you explain that ?
can you expand on that ?
can you talk about what it take to build a great team of ai researcher and engineer ?
this is one of these statement thats more true every every every month every month .
i see this statement a more true than i did the month before .
if i were to do with thought experiment let say you have a team of one hundred people that are super smart motivated in the line with the mission and thats your company .
or you can have a team of one thousand people where two hundred people are super smart super lined with the mission .
and then eight hundred people are let say you pick eight hundred random random big tech employee .
which would you rather have ?
the talent mass is greater in the group of in the group of one thousand people .
you have even a larger number of incredibly talented incredibly aligned incredibly smart people .
but the issue is that if every time someone super talented look around they see someone else super talented and super dedicated that set the tone for everything .
that set the tone for everyone is super inspired to work at the same place .
if you have a thousand or tenzero people and thing have regressed ?
you are not able to do selection and you are choosing random people .
what happens is then you need to put a lot of process and a lot of guardrail in place .
because people do not fully trust each other .
you have to adjudicate political battle .
there are many thing that slow down the orgs ability to operate .
and we are nearly a thousand people .
and weve tried to make it that a large a fraction of those thousand people a possible are super talented super skilled .
it is one of the reason weve weve slowed down hiring a lot in the last few month .
we grew from three hundred to eight hundred i believe .
i think in the first seven eight month of the year .
and now weve slowed down .
we are at last three month we went from eight hundred to nine hundred to nine hundred and fifty something that .
do not quote me on the exact number .
but i think there an inflection point around the thousand and we want to be much more careful how we grow early on .
and now a weve hired a lot of physicist .
theoretical physicist can learn thing fast .
even even more recently a weve continued to hire that weve had a high bar for on both the research side and the software engineering side have hired a lot of senior people including folk who used to be at other other company in this space .
and we continued to be very selective .
it is very easy to go from one hundred to one thousand to one thousand to tenzero without paying attention to making sure everyone ha a unified purpose .
it is powerful .
if your company consists of a lot of different freedom that all want to do their own thing they are all optimizing for their own thing .
it is very hard to get anything done .
but if everyone see the broader purpose of the company if there trust and there dedication to doing the thing that is a superpower .
that in itself i think can overcome almost every other disadvantage .
and it is the steve job a player .
a player want to look around and see other a player .
there another wave of saying .
i do not know what that is about human nature but it is demotivating to see people who are not obsessively driving towards a single emission .
and it is on the flip side of that super motivating to see that .
it is interesting .
whats it take to be a great ai researcher or engineer from everything youve seen for work and with many amazing people ?
i think the number one quality especially on the research side but both is openmindedness .
sound is easy to be openminded .
you are i am open to anything .
but if i think about my own early history in the scaling hypothesis i wa seeing the same data others were seen .
i do not think i wa a better programmer or better at coming up with research idea than any of the hundred of people that i worked with .
in some way in some way i wa worse .
ive never precise programming of finding the bug writing the gpu kernel .
i could point you to a hundred people here who are better who are better at that than i am .
but the thing that i think i did have that wa different wa that i wa willing to look at something with new eye .
people said we do not have the algorithm yet .
we havent come up with the the way to do thing .
this neural net ha thirty billion thirty million parameter .
what if we gave it fifty million instead ?
that that basic scientific mindset of man i i i see some variable that i could change .
what happens when it change ?
let try these different thing and create a graph .
for even this this wa the simplest thing in the world .
change the number of this wasnt phd level experimental design .
this wa simple and stupid .
anyone could have done this if you hold them that it wa important .
it is also not hard to understand .
you did not need to be brilliant to come up with this .
but you put the two thing together and some tiny number of people some single digit number of people have driven forward the whole field by realizing this .
and it is it is often that if you look back at the discovery the discovery in history they are they are often that .
and this this opened mindedness and this willingness to see with new eye that often come from being newer to the field .
often experience is a disadvantage for this .
that is the most important thing .
it is very hard to look for and test for .
but i think i think it is the most important thing because when you when you find something some new way of thinking thinking about thing when you have the initiative to do that it is absolutely transformative .
and also be able to do rapid experimentation and in the face of that be open minded and curious and looking at the data for these fresh eye and seeing what is that it is saying that applies in a mechanism to interpret ability .
it is another example of this .
some of the early work in backandest to interpret ability simple .
it is no one thought to care about this question before .
you said what it take to be a great air research .
can we rewind the clock back ?
what advice would you give to people interested in ai ?
they are young looking forward to how can i make an impact on the world ?
i think my number one piece of advice is to start playing with the model .
this wa i worry a little this seems obvious advice .
now i think three year ago it wasnt obvious and people started by let me read the latest reinforcement learning paper .
no that wa the that wa the and you should do that a . but now with wider availability of model and apis people are doing this more .
but i think i think experiential knowledge .
these model are new artifact that no one understands .
and getting experience playing with them .
i would also say again in line with the do something new thinking some new direction .
there are all these thing that havent been explored .
for example mechanistic interpretability is still very new .
it is probably better to work on that than it is to work on new model architecture because it is it is more popular than it wa before .
there are probably one hundred people working on it .
but there are not tenzero people working on it .
and it is this fertile area for study .
there there much lowhanging fruit .
you can walk by and you can walk by and you can pick thing .
and the only reason for whatever reason people are not interested in it enough i think there are some thing around long horizon learning and long horizon task where there a lot to be done .
i think evaluation are still we are still very early in our ability to study evaluation particularly for dynamic system acting in the world .
i think there some stuff around multiagent .
skate where the puck is going is my advice .
and you do not have to be brilliant to think of it .
all the thing that are going to be exciting in five year and people even mentioned them a conventional wisdom .
but it is somehow there this barrier that people do not people do not double down a much a they could or they are afraid to do something thats not the popular thing .
i do not know why it happens but getting over that barrier .
thats the my number one piece of advice .
let talk if it could a bit about posttraining .
it seems that the modern posttraining recipe ha a little bit of everything .
supervised fine tuning rlachf the constitutional ai wa rlaif .
thats dr. and it is the again that naming thing .
and then synthetic data seems a lot of synthetic data or at least trying to figure out way to have high quality synthetic data .
whats the if this is a secret sauce that make anthropic cloth incredible ?
how much of the magic is in the pretraining ?
how much is in the posttraining ?
first of all we are not perfectly able to measure that ourselves .
when some great character ability sometimes it is hard to tell whether it came from pretraining or posttraining .
weve developed way to try and distinguish between those two but they are not perfect .
the second thing i would say is when there is not advantage and i think weve been pretty good in general in general at rl perhaps perhaps the best although i do not know because i do not see what go on inside other company .
usually it is not my god we have this secret magic method that others do not have .
usually it is we got better at the infrastructure we could run it for longer or you are able to get higher quality data or we were able to filter our data better or we were able to combine these method and practice .
it is usually some boring matter of practice and trade craft .
when i think about how to do something special in term of how we train these model both pretraining but even more posttraining i think of it a little more again a designing airplane or car .
it is not man i have the blueprint .
maybe that make you make the next airplane but there some cultural trade craft of how we think about the design process that i think is more important than any particular gizmo or able to invent .
first on rlhf what do you think zooming out into asian almost philosophy ?
what do you think rlhf work ?
in that human are often not able to perfectly identify what the model want and what human want in the moment may not be what they want in the long term .
there a lot of subtlety there but the model are good at producing what the human and some shallow sense want .
and it turn out that you do not even have to throw that much compute at it because of another thing which is this thing about a strong pretrained model being halfway anywhere .
once you have the pretrained model you have all the representation you need to get the model to get the model where you want it to go .
do you think our rlhf make the model smarter or appears smarter to the human ?
i do not think it make the model smarter .
i do not think it make the model appear smarter .
it is rlhf bridge the gap between the human and the model .
i could have something smart that can not communicate at all .
we all know people this .
people who are smart but you can not understand what they are saying .
i think rlhf bridge that gap .
i think it is not the only rl we do .
it is not the only rl that will happen in the future .
i think rl ha the potential to make model smarter to make them reasoned better to make them operate better to develop new skill even .
and perhaps that could be done even in some case with human feedback .
but the rlhf we do today mostly doesnt do that yet .
although we are very quickly starting to be able to but it appears to increase if you look at the metric of healthfulness .
it increase that .
it also increase .
what wa this word in leopolds essay ?
or the model are hobbled .
and then you do various training to them to unhovele them .
i that word because it is a rlhf i think rlhf unhoveles the model in some way .
and then there are other way where model hasnt yet been unhovable and need done .
if you can say in term of cost it is pretraining the most expensive thing or is posttraining creep up to that .
at the present moment it is still the case that pretraining is the majority of the cost .
i do not know what to expect in the future but i could certainly anticipate a future where posttraining is the majority of the cost .
in that future you anticipate would it be the human or the ai thats the cost they think for the posttraining ?
i do not think you can scale up human enough to get high quality .
any method that relies on human and us a large amount of compute it is going to have to rely on some scaled supervision method debate or iterated amplification or something that .
on that super interesting set of idea around constitutional ai can describe what it is a first detailed into summer two thousand and twenty .
yes two paper and beyond that .
what is it ?
yes this wa from two year ago .
thats hard because you need to scale up human interaction and it is very implicit .
i do not have a sense of what i want the model to do .
i have a sense of what this average of a thousand human want the model to do .
two idea one is could the ai system itself decide which response is better ?
could you show the ai system these two response and ask which response is better and then second what criterion should the ai use ?
it is a form of selfplay .
you are training the model against itself .
and the ai give the response and then you feed that back into whats called the preference model which in turn feed the model to make it better .
you have this triangle of the ai the preference model and the improvement of the ai itself .
and we should say that in the constitution the set of principle are human interpretable .
they are yeah yeah it is something both the human and the ai system can read .
it ha this nice this nice translatable idea or symmetry .
in practice we both use a model constitution and we use rlhf and we use some of these other method .
it is turned into one tool in a tool kit that both reduces the need for rlhf and increase the value we get from using each data point of rlhf .
it also interacts in interesting way with future reasoning type rl method .
it is one tool in the tool kit but i think it is a very important tool .
but it is a compelling one to u human think about the foundy father and the foundy of the united state .
the natural question is who and how do you think it get to define the constitution the set of principle in the constitution ?
yeah ill give a practical answer and a more abstract answer .
i think the practical answer is look in practice model get used by all kind of different customer ?
and you can have this idea where the model can have specialized rule or principle we find two inversion of model .
and implicitly weve talked about doing it explicitly having having special principle that people can build into the model .
from a practical perspective the answer can be very different from different people customer service agent behaves very differently from the lawyer and obeys different principle .
but i think at the base of it there are specific principle that model have to obey .
i think a lot of them are thing that people would agree with .
everyone agrees that we do not we do not want model to present these cbrn risk .
i think we can go a little further and agree with some basic principle of democracy and the rule of law .
beyond that it get very uncertain .
and there are goal generally for the model to be more neutral to not a spouse the particular point of view .
and more be wise agent or advisor that will help you think thing through .
and will present present possible consideration but do not express strong or specific opinion .
open ai released a model spec where clearly concretely defines some of the goal of the model and specific example ab how the model should behave .
do you find that interesting ?
by the way i should mention the i believe the brilliant john schumann wa a part of that .
he not an anthropic .
do you think this is useful direction ?
my anthropic release a model spec a ?
i think thats a pretty useful direction .
again it ha a lot in common with constitutional ai .
again another example of a race to the top ?
we have something thats we think a better and more responsible way of doing thing .
it is also a competitive advantage .
then others discover that it ha advantage .
and then start to do that thing .
we that no longer have the competitive advantage but it is good from the perspective that now everyone ha adopted a positive practice that others were not adopting .
and our response to that a look we need a new competitive advantage in order to keep driving this race upwards .
thats thats how i generally feel about that i also think every implementation of these thing is different .
there were some thing in the model spec that were not in constitutional ai .
and we we can always we can always adopt those thing or at least learn from them .
again i think this is an example of the positive dynamic that that that that that i that i think we should all want to feel to have .
let talk about the incredible essay .
grace i recommend everybody read it .
it is a long one .
it is rather long .
it is refreshing to re concrete idea about what a positive future look .
and you took a bold stance because it is very possible that you might be wrong on the date or specific .
yeah i am fully expecting to to definitely be wrong about all the detail .
i might be spectacularly wrong about the whole thing and people will well laugh at me for year .
thats thats thats how the future work .
you provided a bunch of concrete positive impact of ai and how exactly a super intelligent ai might accelerate the rate of breakthrough .
and for example biology and chemistry that would then lead to thing we cure most cancer prevent all infectious disease double the human lifespan and on .
let talk about the essay first .
can you give a high level vision of the essay and what key takeaway that people have ?
yeah i have spent a lot of time in anthropica .
i spent a lot of effort on how do we address the risk of ai ? ?
how do we think about those risk ?
we are trying to do a race to the top what that requires u to build all these capability and the capability are cool .
but we are we are a big part of what we are trying to do is address the risk .
and then a vacation for that is all these positive thing the market is this very healthy organism ?
it is going to produce all the positive thing .
the risk i do not know we might mitigate them .
and we can have more impact by trying to mitigate the risk .
but i noticed that one flaw in that way of thinking and it is it is not a change in how serious light take the risk .
it is it is maybe a change in how i talk about them .
is that no matter how logical or rational that line of reasoning that i gave might be if if you only talk about risk your brain only think about risk .
and and i think it is very important to understand what if thing do go .
and the whole reason we are trying to prevent these risk is not because we are afraid of technology not because we want to slow it down .
it is it is it is because if we can get to the other side of these risk ?
if we can run the gauntlet successfully to put it in stark term then then on the other side of the gauntlet are all these great thing .
and these thing are worth fighting for .
and these thing can inspire people .
and i think i imagine because look you have all these investor all these vcs all these ai company talking about all the positive benefit of ai .
but a you point out it is it is it is weird .
there a earth of getting specific about it .
there a lot of random people on twitter posting these gleaming city and this this vibe of grind accelerate harder kick out the diesel .
it is it is this very this very aggressive ideological .
but then you are what are you what what are you excited about ?
and and i figured that i think it would be interesting and valuable for someone who coming from the risk side to try and and to try and make a try at at explaining explaining what the benefit are .
both because i think it is something we can all get behind .
and i want people to understand .
i want them to understand that this is not this is not dumers versus accelerationists .
this this is that if you have a true understanding of where thing are going with with ai and maybe thats the more important access .
ai is moving fast versus ai is not moving fast .
then you appreciate the benefit and you you you you you you you you want humanity .
our civilization disease those benefit .
but you also get very serious about anything that could derail them .
i think the starting point is to talk about what this powerfully i which is the term you to use most of the world us agi but you do not the term because it is ha too much baggage .
it is become meaningless .
it is we are stuck with the term .
maybe we are stuck with the term and my effort to change them are futile .
it is admirable .
ill tell you what else i do not this is a pointless semantic point .
i think it is it is a little let say it wa one thousand nine hundred and ninety five and moore law making the computer faster .
and for some reason there there there had been this verbal tick that everyone wa someday we are going to have super computer .
and super computer are going to be able to do all these thing that once we have super computer well be able to sequence that and well be able to do other thing .
and and one it is true the computer are getting faster and a they get faster they are going to be able to do all these great thing .
but there there no discrete point at which you had a super computer and previous computer were not to super computer at term we use .
but it is a vague term to describe computer that are faster than what we have today .
there no point at which you pas the threshold and you are my god we are doing a new type of computation and new .
and i feel that way about agi .
there a smooth exponential .
and if by agi you mean agi is getting better and better and gradually it is going to do more and more of what human do and told it is going to be smarter than human .
and then it is going to get smarter even from there than then yes i believe in agi .
but if if agi is some discrete or separate thing which is the way people often talk about it then it is a meaningless buzzword .
yeah to me it is a platonic form of a powerful ai exactly how you define it .
you find it very nicely .
on the intelligence axis it is on pure intelligence .
it is smarter than a nobel prize winner a you describe across most relevant discipline .
thats intelligence .
it is both in creativity and being able to generate new idea all that stuff in every discipline nobel prize winner .
in their prime .
it can use every modality .
this selfexplanatory but operate across all the modality of the world .
it can go off for many hour day and week to do task and do it own detailed planning and only ask you help when it is needed .
it can use this is interesting .
i think in the s you said again it is a bet thats not going to be embodied but it can control embodied tool .
it can control tool robot laboratory equipment .
the resource used to train it can then be repurposed to run million of copy of it .
and each of those copy would be independent that can do their own independent work .
you can do the cloning of the intelligence .
yes you might imagine from outside the field that there only one of these ?
you made it youve only made one .
but the truth is that the scale up is very quick .
we do this today .
we make a model and then we deploy thousand maybe ten of thousand of instance of it .
i think by the time certainly within two to three year whether we have these super powerful ai or not cluster are going to get to the size where youll be able to deploy million of these .
and theyll be faster than human .
and if your picture is all well have one and then itll take a while to make them my point there wa no you have million of them away .
and in general they can learn and act ten to one hundred time faster than human .
thats a nice definition of powerful ai .
that but you also write that clearly such an entity would be capable of solving very difficult problem very fast .
but it is not trivial to figure out how fast .
two extreme position both seem false to me .
the singularity is on the one extreme and the opposite and the other extreme .
can you describe each of the extreme ?
yeah and why ?
yeah let describe the extreme .
one extreme would be look .
if we look at evolutionary history there wa this big acceleration where for hundred of thousand of year we had singlecell organism and then we had mammal and then we had ape and then that quickly turned to human .
human quickly built industrial civilization .
and this is going to keep speeding up .
and there no ceiling at the human level .
once model get much much smarter than human theyll get good at building the next model .
and if you write down a simple differential equation this is an exponential .
and whats whats going to happen is that model will build faster model model will build faster model .
and those model will build nanobots that can take over the world and produce much more energy than you could produce otherwise .
and if you solve this abstract differential equation then five day after we we build the first ai thats more powerful than human then the world will be filled with these ai in every possible technology that could be invented will be invented .
i am caricaturing this a little bit .
but i think thats one extreme .
and the reason that i think thats not the case is that one i think they neglect the law of physic it is only possible to do thing fast in the physical world .
some of those loop go through producing faster hardware take a long time to produce faster hardware thing take a long time .
there this issue of complexity .
i think no matter how smart you are people talk about we can make model of biological system that will do everything the biological system .
i think computational modeling can do a lot .
even if it is not interacting with a physical world the modeling is going to be hard .
yeah i think the modeling is going to be hard in getting the model to match the physical world is going to be all it doe have to interact with the model .
yeah yeah but it is you look at even the simplest problem if they talk about the three body problem or simple chaotic prediction or predicting the economy .
it is hard to predict the economy two year out .
maybe the case is normal human can predict whats going to happen in the economy next quarter .
they can not do that .
maybe a ai system thats a zillion time smarter can only predict it out a year or something .
instead of you have these exponential increase in computer intelligence for linear increase in in in ability to predict .
same with again biological molecule molecule interacting you do not know whats going to happen when you perturb but when you perturb a complex system you can find simple part in it .
if you are smarter you are better at finding these simple part .
and then i think human institution human institution are are difficult .
i will not give specific example but it is been hard to get people to adopt even the technology that weve developed even one where the case for their efficacy is very very strong .
people have concern .
they think thing are conspiracy theory .
it is also been very difficult to get very simple thing through the regulatory system. ?
i think and i do not want to disparage anyone who work in regulatory regulatory system of any technology .
they are hard tradeoff .
they have to deal with .
they have to save life .
but but the system a a whole i think make some obvious tradeoff that are very far from maximizing human welfare .
and if we bring ai system into this into these human system often the level of intelligence may not be the limiting factor. ?
it it may be that it take a long time to do something .
now if the ai system circumvented all government if it said i am dictator of the world and i am going to do whatever some of these thing that could do .
again the thing have you do with complexity .
i still think a lot of thing would take a while .
i do not think it help that the ai system can produce a lot of energy or go to the moon some people in comment responded to the essay saying the ai system can produce a lot of energy and smarter ai system .
thats missing the point .
that cycle doesnt solve the key problem that i am talking about here .
i think i think a bunch of people miss the point there .
but even if it were completely online and could get around all these human obstacle that would have trouble .
but again if you want this to be an ai system that doesnt take over the world that doesnt destroy humanity then it is going to need to follow basic human laws. ?
if we want to have an good world we are going to have to have an ai system that interacts with human not one that creates it own legal system or disregard all the law or all of that .
a inefficient a these process are we are going to have to deal with them because there need to be some popular and democratic legitimacy in how these system are rolled out .
we can not have a small group of people who are developing these system say this is whats best for everyone. ?
i think it is wrong and i think in practice is not going to work anyway .
you put all those thing together and we are not going to change the world and upload everyone in five minute .
i i do not think ai ai i do not think it is going to happen and be to to the extent that it could happen it is it is not the way to lead to a good world .
thats on one side .
on the other side there another set of perspective which i have in some way more sympathy for which is look weve seen big productivity increase before ?
economist are familiar with studying the productivity increase that came from the computer revolution and internet revolution and generally those productivity increase were underwhelming .
they were le than you then you might imagine .
there wa a quote from robert solo the computer revolution everywhere except the productivity statistic .
why is this the case ?
people point to the structure of firm the structure of enterprise how how slow it is been to roll out or existing technology to very poor part of the world which i talk about in the essay ?
how do we get these technology to the poorest part of the world that are behind on cell phone technology computer medicine let alone new fangle day eye that hasnt been invented yet .
you could have a perspective thats this is amazing technically but it is all enough in burger .
i think tyler cowen who wrote something response to my essay ha that perspective .
i think he think the radical change will happen eventually but he think itll take fifty or one hundred year .
and you could have even more static perspective on the whole thing .
i think there some truth to it .
i think the time scale is too long .
and i can see it .
i can see both side with today ai .
a lot of our customer are large enterprise who are used to doing thing a certain way .
ive also seen it in talking to government ?
those are those are prototypical institution entity that are slow to change .
but the dynamic i see over and over again is yes it take a long time to move the ship .
you find two thing that move thing forward .
one you find a small fraction of people within a company within a government who see the big picture who see the whole scaling hypothesis who understand where ai is going or at least understand where it is going within their industry .
and there are a few people that within the current within the current u government who see the whole picture .
and and those people see that this is the most important thing in the world until they agitate for it .
and the thing that they alone are not enough to succeed because they are a small set of people within a large organization .
but a the technology start to roll out a it succeeds in some place in the folk who are most willing to adopt it the specter of competition give them a wind at their back because they can point within their large organization .
they can say look these other guy are doing this ?
one bank can say look this newfangled hedge fund is doing this thing .
they are going to eat our lunch .
in the u we can say we are afraid china going to get there before we are .
and that combination the specter of competition plus a few visionary within these within these the organization that in many way are are sclerotic you put those two thing together and it make something happen .
it is interesting .
it is a balance fight between the two because inertia is very powerful .
but but but eventually over enough time the innovative approach break through .
and ive seen that happen .
ive seen the arc of that over and over again .
and it is the barrier are there .
the barrier to progress the complexity not knowing how to use the model how to deploy them are there .
and for a bit it seems they are going to last forever .
but then eventually change happens and always come from a few people .
i felt the same way when i wa an advocate of the scaling hypothesis within the ai field itself and others did not get it .
it felt then it felt we had a secret almost no one ever had .
and then a couple year later everyone ha the secret .
and i think thats how it is going to go with deployment to ai in the world .
it is going to the barrier are going to fall apart gradually and then all at once .
and i think this is going to be more .
and this is an instinct .
i could easily see how i am wrong .
i think it is going to be more ten five or ten year a i say in the essay then it is going to be fifty or one hundred year .
i also think it is going to be five or ten year more than it is going to be five or ten hour .
and i think a lot of these people who write down me differential equation who say ai is going to make more powerful ai who can not understand how it could possibly be the case that these thing will not change fast .
i think they do not understand these thing .
what do you use the timeline to where we achieve agi aka powerful ai aka super useful ai ?
i am going to start calling with that .
it is a debate about naming .
on pure intelligence it can smarter than a nobel prize winner and every relevant discipline and all the thing weve said .
modality can go and do stuff on it own for day week and do biology experiment on it own .
let tick to biology .
because yeah i would use sold me on the whole biology and health section .
it is exciting from i wa getting getting from a scientific perspective and maybe you want to be a biologist .
no no this wa the feeling i have when i wa writing it that it is this would be such a beautiful future .
if we can if we can if we can make it happen ?
a much a we fight about about all these political question is is this something that could bring u together ?
but you were asking when when when when when do you think whats but number on this ?
this this is of course the thing ive been grappling with for many year and i am not i am not at all confident .
whoevers ex these clip will will will will crop out the thing i said and and and only say the thing i am about to say but ill say it anyway .
thats fine .
if you extrapolate the curve that weve had far ?
if if you say i do not know we are starting to get to phd level and and last year we were at under graduate level and the year before we were at the level of a high school student .
again you can you can you can quibble with at what task and for what we are still missing modality but those are being added .
computer use wa added .
if you and this is unscientific but if you eyeball the rate at which these capability are increasing it doe make you think that well get there by two thousand and twenty six or two thousand and twenty seven .
again lot of thing could derail it .
we could run out of data .
we might not be able to scale cluster a much a we want .
maybe taiwan get blown up or something and then we can not produce a many gpus a we want .
there are there are all kind of thing that could derail the whole process .
i do not fully believe the straight line extrapolation but if you believe the straight line extrapolation youll youll well get there in two thousand and twenty six or two thousand and twenty seven .
i think the most likely is that there some mild delay relative to that .
i do not know what that delay is but i think it could happen on schedule .
i think there could be a mild delay .
i think there are still world where it doesnt happen in a hundred year .
those world the number of those world is rapidly decreasing .
we are rapidly running out of truly convincing brocclers truly compelling reason why this will not happen in the next few year .
there were a lot more in two thousand and twenty .
although my my guess my hunch at that time wa that well make it through all those blocker .
people call them scaling law .
thats a misnomer .
moore law is is is a misnomer .
they are not law of the universe .
they are empirical regularity .
i am going to bat in favor of them continuing but i am not certain of that .
you extensively describe the compressed 21st century how agi will help set forth a chain of breakthrough in biology and medicine that help u in all these kind of way that i mentioned .
how do you think what are the early step in my due ?
and by the way ask claude good question to ask you about the and claude told me task would you think is a typical day for biologist working on agi look under in this future ?
a lot is curious .
let me let me start with your first question and then ill answer that .
claude want to know whats in it future ?
who might get it be working with ?
i think one of the thing i went hard on and when i went hard on in the essay is let me go back to this idea of because it is had it had an impact on me .
this idea that within large organization and system they are end up being a few people or a few new idea who cause thing to go in a different direction they would have before who disproportionately affect the trajectory .
there a bunch of the same thing going on ?
if you think about the health world there trillion of dollar to pay out medicare and other health insurance and then the nih is one hundred billion .
and then if i think of the few thing that have revolutionized anything it could be encapsulated in a small small fraction of that .
and when i think of where will ai have an impact ?
i am can ai turn that small fraction into a much larger fraction and raise it quality ?
and within biology my experience within biology is that the biggest problem of biology is that you can not see whats going on .
you have very little ability to see whats going on and even le ability to change it ?
what you have is this from this you have to infer that there a bunch of cell that within each cell is a three billion base pair of dna built according to a genetic code .
and there are all these process that are going on without any ability of u a unogmented human to affect it .
these cell are dividing most of the time thats healthy but sometimes that process go wrong and thats cancer .
the cell are aging .
your skin may change color develop wrinkle a you a you age .
and all of this is determined by these process .
all these protein being produced transported to various part of the cell binding to each other .
and in our initial state about biology we did not even know that these cell existed .
we had to invent microscope to observe the cell .
we had to we had to invent more powerful microscope to see below the level of the cell the level of molecule .
we had to invent xray crystal logography to see the dna .
we had to invent gene sequencing to read the dna .
now we had to invent proteinfolding technology to to predict how it would fold and how they find how these thing bind to each other .
we had to we had to invent various technique for now .
we can edit the dna a of with crispr a of the last twelve year .
the whole history of biology a whole big part of the history is our ability to read and understand whats going on and our ability to reach in and selectively change thing .
and my view is that there much more we can still do there ?
you can do crispr but you can do it for your whole body .
let say i want to do it for one particular type of cell and i want the rate of targeting the wrong cell to be very low .
thats still a challenge .
thats still thing people are working on .
thats what we might need for gene therapy for certain disease .
and the reason i am saying all of this and it go beyond beyond this to to gene sequencing to new type of nano material for observing whats going on inside cell for antibody drug conjugate .
the reason i am saying all of this is that this could be a leverage point for the ai system ?
that the number of such invention it is in the mid double digit or something mid double digit maybe low triple digit over the history of biology .
let say i have a million of these ai can they discover a thousand working together can they discover thousand of these very quickly ?
and doe that provide a huge lever instead of trying to leverage the two trillion a year we spend on medicare or whatever can we leverage the one billion a year thats thats spent to discover but with much higher quality .
and what what is it being a scientist that work with with an ai system the way i think about it is i think in the early stage the ai are going to be grad student .
you are going to give them a project .
you are going to say i am the experienced biologist .
ive set up the lab the biology professor or even the grad student themselves well say here what here what you can do with an ai ai system .
id to study this and the ai system it ha all the tool .
it can look up all the literature to decide what to do .
it can look at all the equipment .
it can go to a website and say hey i am going to go to thermofisher or whatever the lab equipment company is the lab equipment company is today and my my time wa thermofisher .
i am i am going to order this new equipment to do this .
i am going to run my experiment .
i am going to write up a report about my experiment .
i am going to inspect the image for contamination .
i am going to decide what the next experiment is .
i am going to write some code and run a statistical analysis .
all the thing that grad student would do that will be a computer with an ai that the professor talk to everyones to while and it say is what you are going to do today .
the ai system come to it with question .
when it is necessary to run the lab equipment it may be limited in some way .
and itll look there a human professor in a thousand ai grad student and if you if you go to one of these nobel prize winning biologist or youll say you had fifty grad student .
now you have a thousand and they are smarter than you are by the way .
then i think at some point itll flip around where the the ai system will will be the pi will be the leader and and theyll be theyll be ordering human or other ai system around .
i think thats how itll work on the research side and they would be the inventor of a crispr type technique .
they would be the inventor of a crispr type technology .
can we get better at statistical design that what clinical trial that used to require fivezero people and therefore needed one hundred million in the year to enroll them .
now they need five hundred people and two month to enroll them .
thats where we should start .
i do not know that would be my picture doing an in vitro and doing it .
you still slow down it still take time but you can do much much faster .
and when you add up all those positive direction do you get everything that wa going to happen from here to two thousand one hundred instead of happens from two thousand and twenty seven to two thousand and thirty two or something ?
another way that i think the world might be changing with ai even today but moving towards this future of the the powerful super useful ai is programming .
how do the nature of programming because it is intimate to the actual act of building ai ?
how do that changing for u human ?
i think thats going to be one of the area that change fastest for two reason .
one programming is a skill thats very close to the actual building of the ai .
the farther a skill is from the people who are building the ai the longer it is going to take to get disrupted by the ai ?
i truly believe that ai will disrupt agriculture .
maybe it already ha in some way but thats very distant from the folk who are building ai and i think it is going to take longer .
but programming is the bread and butter of a large fraction of employee who work at anthropic and at the other company .
and it is going to happen fast .
the other reason it is going to happen fast is with programming you close the loop .
both when you are trained in the model when you are applying the model the idea that the model can write the code mean that the model can then run the code and then see the result and interpret it back .
and it ha a ability unlike hardware unlike biology which we discussed .
the model ha an ability to close the loop .
and i think those two thing are going to lead to the model getting good at programming very fast .
a i saw on typical realworld programming model have gone from three in january of this year to fifty in october of this year .
we are on that s curve ?
we are going to start slowing down soon because you can only get to one hundred .
but i would guess that in another ten month well probably get pretty close .
well be at at least ninety .
i would guess that the task that the vast majority of coder do ai can probably if we make the task very narrow code ai system will be able to do that .
now that said i think compared to advantage is powerful .
well find that when ai can do eighty of a coder job including most of it thats code with a given spec well find that the remaining part of the job become more leveraged for human ?
human will therell be more about highlevel system design or looking at the app and is it architected and the design and ux aspect ?
and eventually ai will be able to do those a ?
thats my vision of the powerful ai system .
but i think for much longer than we might expect we will see that small part of the job that human still do will expand to fill their entire job in order for the overall productivity to go up .
thats something weve seen .
it used to be that writing writing writing and editing letter wa very difficult and writing the print wa difficult .
a soon a you had word processor and then and then computer and it became easy to produce work and easy to share it then that became instance and all the focus wa on the idea .
this this logic of comparative advantage that expands tiny part of the task to large part of the task and creates new task in order to expand productivity .
i think thats going to be the case .
again someday ai will be better at everything and that logic will not apply and then then we all have humanity will have to think about how to collectively deal with that and we are thinking about that every day .
and thats another one of the grand problem to deal with aside from misuse and autonomy and we should take it very .
itll be le writing thing line by line and itll be more macroscopic .
and i want to with the future of idea look the tooling of interacting with the assistant .
and dropping itself you can not say no it is hard to say what will happen in the future .
currently we are not trying to make such idea or self rather we are powering the company cursor or cognition or some of the other exboh in the security space others that i can mention a that are building such thing themselves on top of our api .
and our view ha been let a thousand flower bloom .
we do not internally have the the resource to trial these different thing .
and well see who succeed and maybe different customer will succeed in different way .
i i i both think this is super promising and it is not it is not it is not something anthropic is not is not eager to at least now compete with all our company in this space and maybe never .
yeah it is been interesting to watch cursor trading a great class successfully because it is been fascinating how many place it can help the program experience .
it is not a trivial .
it is it is astounding .
i feel a a ceo i do not get to program that much and i feel if six month from now i go back itll be completely unrecognizable to me exactly .
in this world wa super powerfully i thats increasingly automated .
whats the source of meaning for u human ?
work is a source of deep meaning for many of u . what do we where do we find the meaning ?
this is something that ive written about a little bit in the essay although i i i give it a bit shorttripped not for any not for any principal reason but this essay if you believe it wa originally going to be two or three page .
i wa going to talk about it at all hand and the reason i i realized it wa an important underexport topic is that i kept writing thing and i wa man i can not do this justice .
and the thing ballooned to forty or fifty page and then when i got to the work and mean section i am man this is not going to be one hundred page .
i am going to have to write a whole lot of the rest say about that .
doe that rob you of the meaning of the whole thing ?
i still made important choice including moral choice .
i still sacrifice i still had to gain all these skill or or a similar exercise think back to one of the historical figure who discovered electromagnetism or relativity or something .
if you told them twentyzero year ago some alien on some alien on this planet discovered this before you did .
doe that rob the meaning of the discovery ?
it seems the process is what matter and how it show who you are a a person along the way and how you relate to other people and the decision that you make along the way those are those were consequential .
i i could imagine if we handle thing badly in the day i world we could set thing up where people do not have any longterm source of meaning or any but thats thats more a choice a set of choice we make .
thats more a set of the architecture of a society with these powerful model .
if we if we design it badly and for shallow thing then that might happen .
assuming we can distribute the benefit of these technology of this technology to everywhere their life are going to get a hell of a lot better .
i i am optimistic about meaning .
i worry about economics and the concentration of power .
thats what i worry about more .
i worry about how do we make sure that that fair world reach everyone ?
when thing have gone wrong for human theyve often gone wrong because human mistreat other human .
that is maybe in some way even more than the autonomous risk of ai or the question of meaning .
that that is the thing i worry about most .
the the concentration of power the abuse of power structure autocracy and dictatorship where a small number of people exploit a large number of people .
i am very worried about that .
and ai increase the amount of power in the world .
and if you concentrate that power and abuse that power it can do immeasurable damage .
yes it is very frightening .
it is very it is very i encourage people highly encouraged people to read the full essay .
that should probably be a book or a sequence of essay because it doe paint a very specific future .
i could tell the later section got shorter and shorter because you started to probably realize that this is going to be a very long essay .
i very much tried to avoid that but i have to admit once i got the biology section i wasnt an expert .
and a much a i expressed uncertainty probably i said some a bunch of thing that were embarrassing or wrong .
i wa excited for the future you painted and thank you much for working hard to build that future and thank you for talking thanks for having me .
i i hope we can get it and make it real and if there one message i want to i want to send it is that to get all this stuff to make it real .
we we both need to build the technology build the the company the economy around using this technology positively but we also need to address the risk because they are those risk are in our way .
they are they are landmines on on the way from here to there and we have to diffuse those landmines if we want to get there .
it is a balance all thing in life .
all thing .
thanks for listening to this conversation with daria amadeh and now dear friend here amanda askle .
you are a philosopher by training .
what question did you find fascinating through your journey in philosophy in oxford and nyu and then switching over to the ai problem at openai and anthropoc .
i think philosophy is a good subject if you are fascinated with everything .
because there a philosophy of everything .
if you do philosophy of mathematics for a while and then you decide that you are interested in chemistry you can do philosophy of chemistry for a while you can move into ethic or philosophy of politics .
i think towards the end i wa interested in ethic primarily .
that wa what my phd wa on .
it wa on a technical area of ethic which wa ethic where world contain infinitely many people strangely .
a little bit le practical on the end of ethic .
it is probably one of the most fascinating question ive ever encountered in philosophy and i love it .
but i would rather see if i can have an impact on the world and see if i can do good thing .
and i think that wa around the time that ai wa still probably not a widely recognized a it is now .
that wa around two thousand and seventeen two thousand and eighteen .
and what is ai policy in tail ?
at the time this wa more thinking about the political impact and the ramification of ai and then i slowly moved into ai evaluation how we evaluate model how they compare with human output whether people can tell the difference between ai and human output .
and then when i joined on throphic i wa more interested in doing technical alignment work and again seeing if i could do it and then being if i can not then thats fine i tried the way i lead life i think .
what wa that taking a leap from the philosophy of everything into the technical ?
i think that sometimes people do this thing that i am not that keen on where there will be is this person technical or not ?
you are either a person who can code and is not scared of math or you are not .
and i think maybe more i think a lot of people are very capable of working these kind of area if they try it .
and i did find it that bad .
politics is messy and it is harder to find solution to problem in the space of politics definitive clear provable beautiful solution a you can with technical problem .
it is also funny if people think about the slack channel because i am thats one of five or six different method that i have for talking with clothes and i am yes this is a tiny percentage of how much i talk with clothes .
do you also have to figure out when clawed should push back on an idea or argue versus you have to respect the world view of the person that arrives to clawed but also maybe help them grow if needed a a tricky balance .
yeah there this problem of sick of incy in language model .
can you describe that ?
what are their trait you already mentioned a bunch but what are their that come to mind that are good in this or a satinian sense for conversation to have ?
yeah i think there one that are good for conversational purpose asking follow question in the appropriate place and i am asking the appropriate kind of question .
yeah your task is how to probe with question .
yeah and you are exploring the long tail the edge the edge case or are you looking for general behavior ?
i think it is almost everything i because i want a film app of the model i am trying to do the whole spectrum of possible interaction you could have with it .
i may be i guess ask question why or what other detail can i provide to help you answer better ?
yeah is that work or no ?
yeah ive done this with the model it doesnt always work but sometimes ill be why did you do that ?
people underestimate the decrease which you can interact with with model yeah i am and something thats usually quote word for word the part that made you and you do not know that it is fully accurate but sometimes you do that and then you change a thing .
how do you get signal feedback about the human experience across thousand thats a thought hundred of thousand of people what their pain point are what feel good .
are you using your own intuition a you talk to it to see what are the pain point ?
there would be a special touring test moment where clothes say i need a break for an hour and it sound you do too and leave clothes of the window .
yeah it is the inspired me to add that to the user prompt .
to move you her do you think will be headed there one day where human have romantic relationship with ai system in this case it is text and voicebased .
i think that we are going to have to navigate a hard question of relationship with ai especially if they can remember thing about your past interaction with them .
i am of many mind about this because i think the reflexive reaction is to be this is very bad and we should prohibit it in some way .
i think it is a thing that ha to be handled with extreme care for many reason one is this is a for example a few of the model changing this you probably do not want people performing longterm attachment to something that might change with the next iteration .
there a way in which i could see it being healthy and helpful .
it is a case where it is if you imagine i the idea of the model say knowing roughly how they were trained and and i think cold will often do this .
for there are thing part of the trait training included what clothes should do if people explaining the limitation of the relationship between any eye and a human that it doesnt retain thing from the conversation .
andthropic may be the very company to develop a system that we definitively recognize a a gi and you very might be the person that talk to it .
probably talk to it first .
what would the conversation contain what would be your first question ?
it depends partly on the capability level of the model .
in many way i am i can then have useful conversation with it .
if i am working on something a part of my research i can be which i already find myself starting to do if i am i feel there this thing in virtue ethic and i can not quite remember the term ill use the model for thing that .
but what if it is two time the smartest human on earth on that particular discipline ?
yeah i guess you are good at probing cloud in a way that push it limit .
understand any more the limit are .
i guess what would be a question you would ask to be yep this is agi ?
thats hard because it feel in order to it ha to be a series of question if there wa one question you can train anything to answer one question extremely .
if id you can probably train at time for twenty question extremely .
how long would you need to be locked in a room with an agi to know this thing is agi ?
i think thing that i can probe the edge of human knowledge of i think this with philosophy a little bit .
maybe thats the thing where i am ive thought of a cool novel argument in this niche and i am going to probe you to see if you can come up with it and how much prompting it take to get you to come up with it .
and i think for some of these at the edge of human knowledge question i am you could not in fact come up with the thing i came up with .
i think people over estimate that novelty is not it is completely different from anything thats ever happened thats this is it can be a variant of thing that have happened and still be novel .
but i think yeah if i saw the the more i were to see completely a novel work from the model that that would be and this is going to feel iterative .
one of those thing where there never it is people i think want there to be a moment and i am i do not know i think that there might never be a moment it might be that there this continuous ramping up .
i have a sense that there will be thing that a model can say that convinces you this is very it is not ive talked to people who are truly wise there you can tell there a lot of horsepower there .
maybe in a way that the universe is much better off than we are in it and then we should definitely survive and spread throughout the universe .
yes interesting because i think people focus much on intelligence especially with model .
what are possible next exciting direction to you in this space of mechanism ?
yeah youve youve written about this is oregon question .
yeah exactly if we think of interpretability a a anatomy of neural network most of the circus threat wallstudying tiny little vein looking at the small scale in an individual neuron and how they connect .
i suppose to nearby algae a psychologist or psychiatrist or some a neural network and i think that the beautiful thing would be if we could go and rather than having disparate field for those two thing if you could have a build a bridge between them .
all such that you could go and have all of your higher obstruction be grounded very formally in this very solid more rigorous ideally foundation .
what do you think is a difference between the human brain the biological neural network and the artificial neural network ?
you can go and oblate neuron you can edit the connection and on and then you can undo those change thats pretty great .
yeah you can force any you can intervene on any neuron and force an active and see what happens which neuron are connected to everything you have neuroscience ha one to connect and we have the connectome and we have it for much bigger than the elegans .
hey everyone welcome back to the fourfourthree security simplified .
i am your host mark the liberty and joining me today is cory it is a beautiful day in the neighborhood not cry a corys suggesting on today episode there nothing bad going on in the world and everything is fine .
business a usual .
thats my own dissolution going on now .
i had to throw a little bit of licensing shade that is fair .
thats said if we are drawing an apple to apple comparison this is probably more similar to the watch guard management server which memory service did need license five i think i think you get five .
you got a free for thrive .
yeah anyways watch guard cloud what you should be using clearly .
i thought thats interesting .
long after cyclops blink even after we transparently talked about that dan had issue with they claimed we werent transparent about it ultimately because we released a cv for it later and we do not believe thats the case .
we detailed the vulnerability we warned people to get the patch .
we werent trying to hide any vulnerability i admit we we later on agree that we want to follow a cv process for every single customer any vulnerability that requires customer action ?
there might be more to the story we do not know that said i do have to admit it is it is interesting .
that aside keep going on this mark it is interesting that i i can think of it for two way .
they are because it clearly did tip people off humorous yeah there a reddit thread .
i do you accept the nda by reading release note anyways correct .
yeah thats but they have since by the way they have since given an official piece or reply .
if you are a customer and are curious make sure to go check that one out i think my main takeaway from this is a much a security vendor want to be a transparent a possible a much a software vendor want to be a transparent a possible .
i think thats the most important part of transparency that youve fixed it that you are taking action and that you are doing something different .
i think that build trust maybe one day well find out why it took long to get an official patch out for something that wa being exploited but interesting story for sure which we knew more about the nuance .
i guess well find out .
dan will good and release any more article it is possible .
i still use it a a relevant and timely thing i think in my brain it is somewhere within the last two or three year five year .
weve always had security in our cio department but making it a standalone thing wa in part because of targeting of it and security company .
i can not believe it is been five year five year .
they were hacked because they used a solar wind product that wa insecure and got trojanized now they are they are ready the issue with supply chain issue is you have to pay for someone el security mistake but now they have to pay fine on top of it .
granted it is for maybe i would argue they depending on the detail in these case .
yes you could be if you were affected by this you should have told your customer but it make it ironic even more and slam home how much supply chain attack can harm those thirdparty company ?
it is one that got trojanized that had nothing to do with you what ?
that doesnt necessarily mean within four day of the event happening it is once youve determined it might seem material meaning it could impact your share shareholder or someone willingness to invest in the company .
thats the criterion for material then you have four day to file that which is pretty short but that said there way to extend that if you work with the doj .
i find it a little i understand but i find it a little funny that some of the strictest requirement come from not protecting people or customer but from protecting shareholder that it feel absolutely american .
it all come down to money .
i think you said you did the calculation .
yeah absolutely insane scale on that one .
yeah absolutely nut .
yeah no doom stay for once be transparent and be good neighbor we should have mr. roger come out .
i should take off my sweater and leave the house now to some nice calming music i missed that guy and the world wa a little bit better when it wa much night .
i would vote for him hey something tell me he would never run for anything in this political .
no he know better he ha better way to affect the world .
we miss you mr. rogers hey everyone thanks again for listening a always if you enjoyed today episode do not forget to rate review and subscribe if you have any question on today topic or suggestion for future episode episode topic you can keep them to yourselves .
i would be impressed if my phone could focus that far but if one of you figure that out hat off to you thanks again for listening and you will hear from u next week you
you can see from short distance away with your naked human eye thats some of them appear to be very precise .
and then polish to a level precision that it hears to potentially the machining itself .
if these were cut or carved and then polished they look ultraprecise and to a normal person some of them look almost perfect .
the pervidence or when exactly these thing were originally found we do not know .
this one is attributed to nikata .
it is considered to be nikata based .
and i got that one with the college of beaford the egyptian college of started .
these look special .
they do not seem to be made by the people that they are ascribed to .
those people do not seem to have had the technology to do them .
there no evidence of that .
they seem to be in possession of them however .
and is there a way we can take a look at these object to see if there any information we can extract from them .
but when i thought i had a few that seemed they were i had one of them scanned by a representative of a defense industry contractor .
a plate is then cut and parallel with the ground .
these are different plane we sliced .
we sliced and we created an artificial plane .
looked at all the point along that particular plane .
calcutta is standard deviation of each point from that prefix circle .
that computer dropped generates and say if they were going for a perfect circle how close do they get ?
how good is this relative ?
and here we can see the interior next area .
we are almost to see .
to about the scene .
now every point a little bit different .
this is twelve micron .
this is sixteen micron .
these point are probably an inch apart .
but two centimeter apart from each other .
yeah sixteen micron is zero.sixteen millimeter .
thats fine and sane .
hi everyone .
thanks for tuning in .
if you are enjoying the show and want to support me there are a few way you can help .
by becoming a patreon member you will get access to discord exclusive content and behind the scene update on my research .
for instance i recently traveled to london to scan predynastic way at the petium museum .
your support make that possible .
search for ancient technology on patreon or check the link in the description for all donation option .
your support not only keep the podcast going but also fund the research behind it .
covering cost equipment and travel .
thanks again for being here and i am excited to keep bringing you more great content and discovery .
but now let jump back to the show .
thank you .
we are flying to london today .
yes we are .
the petium museum .
we will have some project to do there .
but i wanted to sit down with you to talk about ancient precision way .
it is hard stone way .
and your entire journey with this project and this topic started .
when did you do you realize these thing are interesting ?
how did it start ?
this wa shown to me and explained to me by archaeologist both professionally and amateur in egypt .
i saw these firsthand ten year ago or more .
i had heard from local via being in the museum and seeing these piece on display .
back down there were at that many of them and it wasnt regarded a something thats special .
but there are people that are always war people that were talking about these .
i think this had gone back to the age of petrie in the late 1800s and beyond .
but guide in egypt muhammad ibrahim yusuf ouyran and then what i met robert schak dr. robert schak a bos in university .
they mentioned thing about these day .
and even over the chuck dr. robert schak .
he too .
i thought he moving on a completely different he is .
but he a geologist .
and any object thats made in stone is going to be adventurous to him especially if you recognize the type of stil with igneous rocket .
it is something that he studied for many year .
and the common theme were that there are these object in egypt other than the pyramid and the great monumental work of construction that are of interest a . however their museum we do not know where they are .
no one ever studied and randomized .
after being in egypt in the city when i returned home back to the state my wife and i started looking for these object my thought wa if no one else ha analyzed them thats interesting .
if they are hard to find thats interesting .
but turn out they were all that hard to find and you could find these online for sale via various auction house and heart broker antiquity dealer would commonly have these thing listed on their website for sale because they werent that popular .
they werent that common .
they werent that expensive .
see they werent that rare .
they were common .
they were common and they werent that expensive for a long period of time .
and i thought at the very least this is a piece of potentially prehistoric or prediynastic history would be very cool to own a piece of that but not i am not driven by i am not a collector i am not a hoarder necessarily .
but i thought it is some point to be nice to have enough of these and do some actual real work or collaborate with others that could .
and after finding a few of them i had i had many of them but they are not all all high interest .
they are not all of of high quality or accurate to what we are going to talk about today .
but when i thought i had a few that seemed they were i had one of them scanned by a representative of a defense industry contractor that wa demoing demonstrating and also selling structured lightskating device .
representative of gold which is now owned by zice but it used to be an independent company .
they made a number of skater .
it is calculating the point and how these stand they are from the cameras. . and it take all those data point .
it put them into it own internal threedimensional coordinate a a matter of a touch of some other metric a . and that file can be exported a a common file that you can then read into a variety of program .
there proprietary program that correspond to some of the different piece of electronics .
each company might make the real proprietary system .
but then you can also use free version blender .
it is an open source system .
you can create custom scripting to make your work in your alices faster .
but there different way you can analyze the threedimensional coordinate system once it is there. . you want it to be in threedimensional cartoon effectively space xyz play .
which allows you to measure distance to look at threedimensional geometry .
how round is this round feature ?
it look round but is it round ?
how round is it relative to a perfect circle or a sphere or a cylinder ?
how flat is something ?
whats the deviation in his elevation or lipid ?
what wa interesting about these phase ?
it should capture your attention .
you can see from short distance away with your naked human thats some of them appear to be very precise .
and then polish to a level precision that it hears to potentially the machining itself .
these were cutter carved and then polished .
they look ultraprecise and to a normal person .
some of them look almost perfect .
this look it wa machined .
it came out of a machine shop off of a assembly line .
some some operation that resulted in creating the level of precision .
and they also do not correspond to other thing in museum .
they look a lot different than the majority of thing found in any museum anywhere .
from anything going back before let say at the sixteen or one thousand seven hundred .
they stand out a being unique .
clearly high level and then poultry .
clearly a higher level than pottery .
although some pottery doe look round some of it wa made in a pottery wheel .
it is not finished to a level of accuracy that aligns with a geometric shape .
this is your piece ?
yeah this is one of them .
and a lot of them were dated to a time before diagnostic egypt .
dynastic egypt is what most historian and textbook would refer to a the first time in human history we had a number of thing .
a written spoken built out language system of government system of process for doing everything from building to archiving trade to managing labor to taxation even financial contract .
that stuff is a summary in an egyptian typically .
and there not much else before that .
we do not know what else before that .
and what we do know and we have talking about roughly threezero bc .
typically the the the the dynasty the early kingdom in egypt would have started around thirty two thirty three three thousand four hundred bc .
sometimes it is referred to a the archaic period .
but generally thats the formation of ancient egypt .
and samaria is sometimes going back a little bit further .
but generally thats the formation of human history a we know it .
thats the thats when the recorded history for start and is preserved .
we do not have human written history that go back before that any longer .
it may be never wa there or it wasnt there for a period of time .
these are dated by archaeologist and they are regarded to be older than the dynastic egypt .
or early dynastic sometimes .
sometimes into the first few dynasty yes .
but a far back officially a four five thousand bc .
and thats because of where they were found .
a lot of you found in up and down egypt .
we have upper egypt and lower egypt .
petri wa excavating throughout the late 1800s .
there are early 1900s .
he excavated a lot of site .
many other people did too .
with egyptologist in there petri .
if you are a human being european each turkeyologist ?
he wa nothing .
he wa english .
but there wa other there wa there wa there french german austrian belgian .
they were all over europe .
they were in egypt .
and doe the museum very early next week .
thats his museum or a decolrectional fee finding .
it sound a lot of the piece were brought back by him or others and then donated later .
you have this concept of of victorian era archaeology .
this wa it wa a new thing .
it wa it wa a fascination by european .
egypt wa a fascination. . a lot of thing were brought out of egypt and brought out of other country .
we know about obelisk large thing that were stood up .
and i live in new york .
there one in new york .
what probably the smallest one ?
but it is still impressive .
some of these are enormous .
and they were successfully brought out of egypt legally or for lack of a better term .
in accordance with the authority in egypt at the time .
a lot of antiquity have been removed for egypt over the year .
and petri his background wa in survey .
he wa in a metrologist by trade but close enough he wa a survey .
he wa a technical person .
and he recognized how precise the workmanship the craftsmanship i guess is in egypt .
he documented thing contour and elevation and metric with respect to pyramid and these bowl a . he wa everywhere in egypt .
he wa the first archaeologist who started to look at thing from the technical perspective or engineering perspective .
probably one of the first probably .
and he did a good job of documenting his effort .
not fire the use of photograph a much he would take some on occasion but he documented his effort up and down egypt .
he credited with the communication the transparency of a lot of the information .
others that followed it is footstep .
i think a lot of time they regard it him a a one of the first great technical archaeologist in egypt these are college .
what documentation do we have other than from him ?
it hit it started in the i would say the lady to glendards baby mid but generally lady to glendards into the 1900s in today .
the 1960s also there wa a lot of work done but in the earlier period you have to car on the step pyramid that that wa excavated for eighty to ninety year at least .
and then whatever can be for that .
thing that we are not documented that we are not official .
in egypt you have a long history of antiquity collecting and for resell .
and if you have longevity and your family history you can maybe afford to wage generation before that stuff is offloaded .
i think i believe and i do not think this is controversial .
that most of the antiquity in egypt most of the thing that or that you do not see we are not excavated or recovered through official mean .
and they werent necessarily documented .
it wasnt always theft because sometimes there were no law regarding this but you are not necessarily documenting everything if you are playing a they keep it for few generation itself .
i think most of the archaeological record is on documented .
since then is it probably able to bring out anything this from egypt ?
now you can not bring very much out at all .
i do not i am not positive but there are various treaty that the egyptian government put in place .
depending on the type of material it is where it came from where it wa found you could export thing up to a certain date .
custom of forcement agency all around the world see a antiquity object .
i wa reading an article that someone had two hundred object in one back .
and it wasnt by the egyptian custom it wa by a different i think european it might have been an inlear or some other country .
and this stuff is still this stuff is still enforced .
egypt doe make claim against certain artifact occasionally when something appears and they know about it it is been on the radar screen .
we are mostly talking about statue we are talking about larger object sometimes smaller object .
and i think now youll see create in other hard stone object that they are working on .
but for a long time these were not regarded a particularly important partly because they were dated to before dinastic egypt .
this came from a diplomatic collection .
i believe it wa brought out .
and i do not know exactly it wa a window the diplomat lived and worked in egypt from the 30 into the 40 . and i am not sure exactly what he brought it out .
but there record of it there a trade myth there manifest that show that he brought it out and he ha documentation around it to avoid being accused of theft they aint late .
thats the province .
the providence or when exactly these thing were originally found we do not know .
this one is attributed to nikata .
it is considered to be in nikata day .
nagada wa the culture before the egyptian culture started .
that wa the precursor civilization but because of the culture .
yeah one of them .
there wa many culture .
one of the yeah one of the closest one it wa predominantly an upper egypt .
thats the region around luxor .
if you are looking at a map of egypt it would be in between lower egypt which is a chirore area and then nubia .
something in the middle .
yeah this considered upper egypt .
it occurs with a full of an island .
and ill flow a north or down .
lower egypt is north upper egypt is middle or south .
and then the northern now whats stood in a lot of that wa this nubian region that then obuts or touch into upper egypt .
nikata wa this culture that inhabited a series of site a series of area geography thats been several hundred mile .
and there a number of different excavation site that were done and then attributed to the nikata culture .
nikata a a culture i think is roughly maybe four thousand five hundred bc .
i am not sure if it wa a early a fivezero bc but ive seen four thousand five hundred forty .
i think in egypt in the nubian museum we have seen those artifact from the nikata culture dated back to around fourfive hundred or something .
yeah the egg the nubian egg .
yes that wa forty five ?
something yeah forty five forty seven .
i will look it up .
yeah it is hard .
i do not know if we can put a specific date on when that culture .
if it wa carbon dated we could but i do not know which one or which grave wa carbonated at all .
yeah neither do i. nikata culture they are famous for these clay or effectively baked river clay pottery .
and they are painted in these design that recur there these recurring theme in their design the way they display hill and mountain and river .
the bottom usually are black .
sometimes a lot of the rock are black .
they seem to resemble some of these stolen vessel .
in the katopaterines i would consider an emulation or an imitation of what they may have thought wa in earlier form .
and they are making pottery that in some case mimic the design of these of certain stone vessel recurring form we see in the stone vessel over and over again .
they are seemingly imitating them and dramatically le precise material clay .
and you can see it across the room you can see that the clay pot the top is not parallel with the ground .
they do not seem to be whatever the intentional shape is .
they do not seem to be perfect geometry .
it wa that imitation i would say probably .
now we have stone tool that are attributed to a lot of these culture and theyve found stone workshop archaeologist have found stone workshop and dated them through different mean back a far a several hundred of thousand bc .
there stolen workshop that are i think widely accepted to be fifty to fifty fivezero .
yes now i do not know how you would date a stolen workshop .
but what by the stolen workshop is a building or a series of structure or building where a high volume of stone tool were seemingly made in one place .
youll see if it wa a if they were flaking off piece of let say flint or another object that you may see remnant built up in a large quantity indicating a lot of these tool are made in one place .
when you say workshop i think you mean an area where the tool are made .
but these officially belongs to the polyolithic time ?
it is not it is a very before the nagela culture .
and all the red culture which we have .
but yeah you could have a stone workshop thats thats used over many different year my many different culture .
and the dating is going to be looking at their earliest date .
it could be reused by many people .
and this is egypt where then then the nile valley is regarded to be inhabited for hundred of thousand of year .
there one river thats the lifeblood of this entire region .
people all live around the river .
it is only natural for many place to be reenhabited many time .
back to your question i think i did not know these were seemingly of various quality and some of the quality were fantastic that the fire explanation .
i did not know that i felt these are special and they seemed they were made by a different time and a different culture .
i think the late antoni west started to talk about these u precise thing .
jonathan he wasted he got a lot of his knowledge from schwaladulubits which which predates him by i think a hundred year .
did you be told already ?
i thought in about these .
i believe there wa a number of people not a lot but a number of people had talked about these type of object .
the precision weve seen this in the pyramid potentially moving back the age of the snake and other object for another megolithic building project several earlier than whats commonly accepted .
and no one had attempted the analysis to refute or accept any of these proposition .
that wa one i think that wa one thing that i guess ill take for that having a scan done and looking at some preliminary result .
now i am not a metrologist let see a big round .
i have a math background .
i have higher education in mathematics it is a statistic i understand math theory and then statistical mathematical theory to some extent .
i do not know a phd but the master is great it help .
but i think the way i think about these thing is top down from an intuitive sense doe this story make sense from what we are seeing ?
and if the answer is no thats thats intuitive nature for me stop and the actual analytics take over and then it is all these look special .
they do not seem to be made by the people that they are ascribed to .
those people do not seem to have had the technology to do them .
there no evidence of that .
they seem to be in possession of them however .
and is there a way we can take a look at these object to see if there any information we can extract from .
you may have from the beginning that those people had no tool which were i do not think thats a fact .
i think thats the mainstream view is that primitive tool were used .
and when i say primitive handle stone handle and potentially early type of metal in some case ?
they had copper .
bronze wa after nagada much later .
that we think. . you be if if somebody making bronze and another culture come in and displaces that culture and it is never seen bronze before they would probably take every piece they could find or reuse them .
we do not know i do not think we know exactly when the bronze age started or how far back people have ever used metal .
but we can we can say when certain culture are using it widely and it wa widespread .
i think i think the point here is i did not know exactly what i wa doing but we started i started seeing some result .
the first scary did eighty nine year ago now showed some very basic metrology result .
the circularity of a few component on that red red and it called the og phase .
i scanned five or six object and that one wa the most precise bidegree .
a few of the other one were but not to the same degree .
and that scanner wa capable of accuracy up to the point up to the limit of the scale and capability we were finding .
i wa proximatetee in what ?
a few thousandth of an inch circularity state or deviation which wa i think the boundary limit of what that scan of what the scanning equipment wa capable of .
after i met chris dunn and his son alex his son alex his metrologist and work in this field quite a bit .
we involved a few other people that work alongside alex and we we tried to not only develop the type of analytics that we were doing type in term of the metric and the making big comparison but then also scan it a many other object a we can .
we eventually used some ct scanning equipment or xray technology weve also used photogrammetry .
it is grown from there which one wa the best and the most accurate .
the ct scanning in term of the methodology .
the ct scanning is by far because it is capturing hundred of time where data point .
but there some problem that have some drawback with that .
photogrammetry is developing quite rapidly .
probably it is probably developing faster than the other .
photogrammetry when you are taking picture and you are stitching those picture together and creating the threedimensional object based on the picture .
thats why it is not that accurate .
a laser structured light or ct. . both are using light ct using xray technology which is a different spectrum .
but i think the point is that technology that ha continued to grow and develop and thanks to shining 3d and the combo scan .
free scan combo .
plus i think it is now at a point where it is more versatile than it used to be while maintaining that level of accuracy .
we can bring a quickment to various site rather than having a break .
the site to the equipment .
i think it is enabling u to expand this into other medium not stone laser .
thats stay choose book etc .
yeah and movable object .
yeah thats how it started and now where it go from here .
there a lot more people involved and to know you and others .
hopefully we can continue to do this work and one day into their future maybe publish some preliminary result .
bring on the engineer and yeah .
whats the actual description of that way they made these face in egypt or even before ?
whats whats the the main source explanation for the making process ?
from what ?
and i think thats evolved that continues to evolve from what i gather the mainstream explanation relates primarily to alibaster .
alibaster is widely known to have been performed in executed beautifully .
in a lot of case bydiedastic egyptian during the ldap old middle and late kingdom .
and alibaster i think truly speaking you would be able to find a joke about alibaster you would using various pounding stone dollarnother thing get a spherical object for you then use some a boring instrument a tubular drill potentially copper with an abrasive .
somehow you have to drill out these interior center .
now curiously some of these the alibaster one are more commonly left with a tube drill and not hollowed out .
some of them are but the hollowing out part typically is explained by this forkstickbased drill .
thats placed inside and then turned and it would scrape out the inside quartz sand and some water and some other abrasive material .
i do not think it is necessarily known what they were using but it is a desert .
there quartz everywhere .
court is a rough way .
it is a heart .
it is a seven on the most scale where alibasters a three .
that would easily cut .
the roman and others were using bronze with i think very little abrasive to cut calcite now alibaster .
some of the stone can be cut with out precision tool whatsoever with very rudimentary hand tool .
that in limestone they are shaped they are beautiful .
there many there probably million of there everywhere .
they are interesting and they are pretty but they are not made to anything close to the level of sophistication that we see in some of the quote unquote predynastic phase .
the stuff thats acknowledged to the older and it is in a harder medium .
we are talking about deer and and granits are there are all the harder of quartz .
and some of these stone are most of the stone are all they are all hard or genius in composition and mineral composition .
meaning there lot of stuff inside them .
it is not one these crystalline collusion and do these stuff. ?
it itself ha a a composition of six to seven eight different type of mineral normally and then when these large this could be felt sport probably felt sport .
they are the pinkish hue or quartz sometimes quartz .
thats going to be a different hardness of different mineral composition and the ground mass material that in dark and darker shade .
thats going to require a positive material of this exactly .
they call it poorfree which is a conglomerate of different material .
the hardness is in a very hardish component of poorfree would probably be the quartz which is around a seven .
if you are looking for a numerical scale thats the most scale .
but it is possible that there other thing in there .
how is whats an abrasive ?
it is a remgenit in oddness .
yeah it is comparable .
it is closer to greater than it is to all of u or anything .
it is probably about that same .
but the way you would go about cutting it it is not a homogeneous piece of seven on the most you need to figure out .
we have harder and softer material inside correct .
and the mineral composition can vary in term of size a . amazing coat .
i know you can pull it shrug easily be it hand but it is still when you this is the first time when i can hold such thing and see with my bare eye and it is beautiful .
even though you said maybe it is handmade .
or not entirely .
this this may not this doesnt appear to have we are doing somewhere now on this now .
but this doesnt appear to be to the same caliber .
a lot of the other piece we scanned it out .
some of them are nearly perfect in every dimensional component of the piece the og .
that doesnt have any flat surface .
everything ha a rainy eye and all the radio are are there phenomenon ?
thats whats candid that first go on ?
or yes weve scanned that several time it is several different device .
weve done it with some with blue light structure light scanning .
weve done it with ct scanning .
we do not want to gravitate the process of scan a they increase in their level of accuracy .
weve seen where accurate result because now the scanner is capable of picking up .
thats a great .
we see result where it is it is five five ten000th of an inch .
way le than 1000th of an inch in term of deviation from perfect circle .
thats le than twenty five light run .
all it is ten micron deviation per per le .
and that level of work is today the way that would be done today .
we could talk about the about the how but it is done today .
but it is reserved for specific application .
and it is done in a modernist material or a most often a metal alloy .
it can be a tip by type of silica a glass for a somebody recently told me the only time youve seen this level of work done is in the lens of a sidewinder missile where it is a it is a type of silica glass .
and it is large .
it is this big .
normally that level of deviation or or tolerance of ua or accuracy is directly related to the size of the object .
the smaller the object would normally correspond to the smaller tolerance thats required to be maintained .
larger object typical do not require that level of tolerance and they are rarely done even in the metal .
it is very rare that you would see a large object .
this is not i do not not saying this is a accurate a the other one whereas some of the other day is that weve looked at but a larger object of this size would be very rare or uncommon to see such small tolerance a applied .
it would not be necessary for any conceivable application .
the lower tolerance is would be required by lower component by smaller component .
thats an additional reason why it is rare .
and the machine we have today are set up and the procedure are set up for clomogenous material .
is this from the same guy same diplomat ?
and through the og day now different is it different from yeah ?
and there many of these thing they were they were hinted out to people .
is the point ?
someone wa visiting and they came home with tenonies .
you said that maybe the lip is not the precise a the neck or the top .
yeah it is hard to speculate .
when you stay back from across the room it look very nice and then you come up with a closeup .
it is because we scanned it .
yeah we will i would defer until we see the scan .
many of these have been dropped and damaged and repolished .
you also see divot that were purposefully smoothed out .
a in some of the grant box the box overall shape look pretty nice when you come up close .
you may see an imperfection that wa then scooped out they looked out and then repolished very carefully potentially because they did not work that imperfection to propagate and expand .
and doe that take away from the overall accuracy ?
it is going to affect the scaling result .
we need to look at these thing comprehensively before we make any conclusion .
the last thing i would say is about this topic is what we can talk about this more .
but in two thousand and fifteen there wa an electron microscopy a microscope a project done by the metropole a metropole a microscope a microscope a microscope .
it is a hundred .
the metropole did not use the inmobart in new york did a study on this about two thousand and fifteen i think .
and they had a limestone block with a cordial in it which is not a common .
that all around egypt but limestone sometimes will have le common to see that .
anyway there seem to be residual material in the bottom .
potentially potentially it wa left over from the last piece of equipment to have done that .
until they said this is interesting .
we see all this residue let analyze it .
and under an electron microscope you can potentially look at the mineral composition .
and they found they found the number of interesting thing there .
they did find bronze and copper residue .
thats whats surprising .
that reinforces the main tree of the they also found quartz and corundum .
some more recently corundum is aluminum the deoxyne if i am not mistaken .
a little bit of oxide is the composition and it occurs naturally a corundum .
corundum and then there different type of gemstone that are a form of corundum a . gemstone mining if you are looking for specific gemstone you may find different type of corundum that you can repurpose and there are gemstone mine in egypt .
this stuff wa there .
there an active corundum mine in egypt still to this day .
it is not unknown where it came from .
but corundum is very hard .
it is a mine on the hardness scale .
it is under a diamond .
and that would have been more than enough to cut most of the material that we see in pyramid and base and everything else .
if you are trying to embrace itll be cut it .
corundum wa found .
and i think that reinforces the view that you could use a soft material copper bronze and a very artobracive slurry or solution that could have quartz and corundum in it and cut through the lens still very easily .
you could cut through granite with that fairly easily .
i think thats the main stream perspective is that thats how these thing were cut .
and indeed that would cut all of these material but cutting and finishing are two different thing .
and when we see not only the cutting but in the polishing that result in a thousand of an inch twenty five micron zero.twenty five millimeter in instead of deviation from perfect circle in term of circularity that can not be done by rudimentary handle .
it can not .
it is not possible .
it is not possible to get there .
you have to make that do a bit something which is the same you are at at least but you have to go feel several magnitude lower or higher in inaccuracy .
typically the tool thats making something need to be capable of making something more accurate than what you are trying to make .
thats to that standard .
you typically can not take a tool thats capable of a point one inch and make something thats a tenth of an inch and make something thats a thousandth of an inch end up .
whats the tumbler for this in menstrual logic ?
the rule ?
yeah for how accurate the device ha to be to reach that level .
in the trial time ?
if we are talking about the tool or the metrology in i think it is generally ten time it is about an order of magnitude ?
if we are talking about metrology how do if what you are doing is that accurate ?
tenth of an inch we can probably see with our eye .
and you can measure that with variety tool .
thousand of an inch you can not .
that level of accuracy is not visible to the human eye .
you find it. . human hair. . fraction .
you can not see that with the naked eye .
and thats maintained across the entire historical body of an object .
and a lot of these object are polished .
when you are polishing an object you are going to do something .
you are going to remove material .
you have to measure how much should i remove from this way or from this direction to reach that precision .
and do i have to i should more here more here more here more here .
these thing are very difficult to do .
they are very difficult to do by today standard in homogenous medium that are softer to cut .
this is a heterogeneous medium .
it is a lot harder to work in .
and we do not have we do not have we do not even have the metrology .
the metrology we have is designed for heterogeneous material glass different metal alloy .
not we do not have stone based metrology because we do not make thing in stone .
we do not have tool for it .
we can we can probably repurpose our tool but there a lot of other reason why it would be quite difficult .
very expensive .
you wouldnt ask somebody for a quote .
you would expect that you are going to pay however much it cost because nobody know how much it is going to cost going to do it .
two thousand slave .
have you seen this experiment on the scientist against myth channel when they made with traditional method they made a granite vase and they converted it with museum piece .
not precisely it wa not scanned precisely or not measured precisely but i do not know that wa a debunker video but it is a little bit funny .
they in my opinion they proved that they can not make these precise way .
this is with the traditional method .
thats funny .
we can use them to illustrate or play .
i commend them for the diligence and dedication to doing that .
it wa impressive .
i wa not i am not going to sit down for whatever it took them a year or two .
i think two year .
thats the mainstream explanation a these were taking several year .
it took them that long using rudimentary technique but they did not replicate these way .
they made something thats rudimentary .
you can see in the video it is not it is not the same .
and when they measured it they did not measure correctly .
a metrology wasnt performed correctly .
they werent looking at deviation .
they were they were they were doing absolute measurement in comparison .
meter both thickness and these .
and this is not there in anything .
it tell that you made something similar in size in similar form .
but yeah the accuracy wasnt there .
but these wa on the centimeter or maybe subsentimeter level but not migrant not even close to migrant .
they are measurement they are not even close to .
and they threw their hand up and said we can not it is not worth it or we do not want to .
that doesnt prove that it that they couldnt then apply a different method .
it is a polishing it down to the accuracy we want .
if they if they roughed out a basic shape then you could go back and finish it maybe with a different method .
i think that there are no hand there are no primitive handbased method that can result in it .
whatever we are talking about we are talking about the use of a machine tool for sure .
now what are the dynamic created with having in the way of machine almost nothing ?
now more often i think more recently there archaeologist and he a topologist that may acknowledge they had to lay it and they had primitive accessbased machine potentially .
and that could help u get a little bit closer .
it is still not enough .
we we learned how to do this decade ago decade ago .
in the 1800s we did not have the capability of making it .
but from everything ive seen and gathered it wa probably 1940s 1950s where we first started being able to achieve these level of tolerance in metal .
from what ive seen it is never been done in granted using modern technology .
we havent seen any example of that .
again we are not seeing a care .
and these are definitely turn when we go down in the in the steptorow meeting sakara .
we have seen those piece and you do not told me that you have some base in there .
you have turning mark in the inside .
we can see line that rotate with the audio of the vessel .
extrations that go around and around .
we are examining a piece a shard an it is a march i guess when we were in egypt with chris king and he realized or he noticed that there are turning mark on this .
it wa a broken part from the from the lower section of a way .
it wa also granite or some similar hard stone and you could clearly see the turning line or the turning mark the tool mark .
these were somehow turned .
or the machine wa revolving .
i do not know if we can prove which one .
there always been a debate or wa the tool spinning or wa the object spinning ?
the the object spinning .
well be returning .
chris king ha had the feeling that it the object wa turning and not the not the on that piece on that piece .
but we can talk with him in a few days. . it .
in other word it is pretty hard to use a tool capable of a tenth of an inch to go to anything higher than that .
it is almost impossible .
it is a chicken and egg problem .
how do we get through the next level of accuracy ?
we need to have those tool .
we need to have the engineering and the knowhow to then translate that into making tool repetitively that are capable producing this accuracy .
it is a chicken and egg problem ?
we do not know what came first .
you do not know how you get there .
thats how it did for u . and it is built up over a long period of time .
one thing to note i you mentioned this with the scientist against that example .
but when we talk about accuracy or tolerance we are talking about state or deviation normally in modern in machining today when something is specified it is usually describing the max deviation .
thats allowed .
we are going to make this cylindrical shape and the max tolerance might be 100th of an inch or zero.two millimeter .
and thats maximum because this this implement all the tool that we generally make today that are designed to tolerance is our functional .
if somethings functioning spinning on an axis we do not want part of it to be rotating and maybe hitting something or interfering with another component or the meaning of that it is spinning inside of ?
thats why tolerance is important because of the function .
why would why would a vase or a vessel need that tolerance ?
of course the traditional explanation is that the holding something mundane flower or water or body oil clearly pottery doe that a . it is a lot easier to make .
and these are holding something why would you need any level of accuracy whatsoever ?
you can see that a certain stone vessel may be very nice looking .
it doesnt have to be that accurate .
it doesnt have to be accurate down to the thousand or a tenzero of an inch .
today they make glass container .
have they ever found glass container in predynastic graf or silver ?
there libyan desert glass which is allegedly created when lightning get the desert and some of those glass piece have been repurposed into object .
i do not think they made glass from desert court .
you need an extremely high temperature and typically electricity is used for that .
i do not think they were making glass .
they were cutting hard stone .
they cut there a desk cut or anything sometimes .
very rarely .
when you did you could see it .
you can see it with your naked eye and it is a little different from the highpresident stone vessel .
because my body oil is perfectly happy in the last container .
thats what i asked .
how much body oil wa one person in the do you need a jug of it in your room in your house at all ?
you pour it in on your head ?
whats that ?
whats going on with all the body oil ?
i do not they do .
they do it in a party .
these egyptian .
these essential oil are nice from egypt .
but they are all in glass container which you can buy today .
you go back to your point .
you need tool and metrology .
you need tool that are capable of generally access accuracy and precision when you are making something .
because of a few thing you have fluctuation and temperature .
you have dust particle and chemical and thing that that can get in the way .
a little tiny piece of sand can get onto something and change thing .
you have wear and tear and damage from repeated use of the tool .
take a look at what cutting glass doe to a tool or trying to make crystal object .
the super precise .
you are putting a lot of wear and tear on a tool thats using an abrasive a forceful mechanism to remove matter .
then you have the abrasion the corrosion and the general degradation to consider .
thats before you are considering the vibrational load that you are putting on a tool .
the manufacturing process itself is going to create a lot of heat and friction .
if you are designing a tool you need to account for that .
what secondary side effect are going to be created when i am starting to hit the spinning renovation or my tool spinning and hitting a stationary rabbit base .
we need to take those into consideration when we are designing our tool .
we are talking about sophistication sophistication thats light year above what the diagnostic egyptian certainly have been credited with .
now the mainstream criticism wa that people could master simple tool if you gave someone a hammer or a chisel or thirty year they would learn how to make a michael angela david sculpture out of marble .
i think thats thats possibly true when you are talking about artistic expression and artistic skill .
we are talking about precision in quality and in notin result .
no simple tool is going to be capable of that .
no matter how skilled the artist is the tool is not capable of it .
those object are not granite they are marble and which is much softer and i am lying stone .
yeah exactly .
i think thats an easy way out and it is not a logical either .
the knowledge engineering it took to figure out how to build these type of tool it took u hundred of year to build .
to build tool capable of reliably doing this or an organ it mean that engineer and metrologists but engineer need to repeatedly measure thing far beyond the limit of human perception .
in an actual manufacturing environment not the finished product but the environment where all this heat and friction is being generated a which deforms the tool and creates other side effect repeatedly .
when you are machining you have this intense build up a heat in both the object and the instrument .
this heat can cause additional error sometimes a lot .
i think this all speaks to the argument that the highest accuracy it may have ensued with some process that wasnt forcible that wasnt in a breeze .
we are not crushing and bashing and knocking piece of the stone away .
we are not flaking it off making a flint spearhead or arrowhead .
thats how they try to rough it out in the sianti stigensmith video .
i saw a copper chisel knocking away visible visible piece of itll mineral content in the stone and the accuracy is far smaller than the visible piece .
and theyve tried to measure the circularity with a hand held pencil .
then it is drawing a line or not on the circular object .
it is yes it is nice to the eye but it is not .
i had the feeling that they do not even understand what we are talking about here .
the metric .
that wa my feeling that this is nice .
this is a very great effort but not are we talking about .
it is nice to see people roll up their sleeve and do something instead of criticize other people online .
i think you have to respect that and give them what i do .
yeah yeah do i. i think that whatever listen if we are having trouble figuring out a way to do today .
i think the answer is they were they had it they had an unknown process with respect to some of the thing they were doing at least that wa either more advanced than we have today or we are something we are not thinking of .
there could be an easy answer that we are not thinking of but the best mind have the best mind of manufacturing have been struggling with this concept for progressive year .
i think the answer is something we are we are something we are missing all together .
thats thats how we connected in in egypt because i told you this project project of mine and yeah your idea wa to let work together because much more effective and this is much more it is wiser to work together in the sembler force .
it depends and it also depends on the application too we are talking about heterogeneous stone again with damaging we are in terror .
sustainability deviation is not always used sometimes maximum or absolute is also yeah yes sometimes we may get a standard deviation but a lot of time there you give the machine instruction usually the tolerance conveyed in term of maximum due to maximum allowable deviation .
do we know in the mexel deviation on the scan ?
yeah we have that too it is the maximum minimum are going to be they should be equal to equal distance for me again i think chipping and breaking piece of stone off is not the logical explanation in term of how these are done .
what about chipping and then pollution ?
yeah to devil in the detail why how would you measure how much you should polish on that side to reach the other side level ?
a we evolve we are using war stone toning again .
then the high level precision is needed yeah .
this is a ... is it called the egyptian cubic the disblack rickting not rectangular but octagonal yeah i think sometimes it wrote something that yeah some a rod yeah is this black is not it basult ?
i think it wa granite could be black granite yeah true .

i loved hearing your work on the spy valley podcast last year but at the time i did not expect that id be speaking to you myself one day but here we are .
first of all i am glad that you mentioned the spy valley podcast which wa a blast to report and write and host and i am thrilled to be here .
with operation entering this article debuted a few day ago and it wa brand new to me and apparently it wa brand new to everyone .
how did you first learn about this story enough to start digging into it for your own work ?
i am based in san francisco and i am an odd duck because i am a national security reporter who is based on the west coast and for i think obvious reason and mostly good reason .
the vast majority pretty much all national security reporting is centered in the washington dc area .
but i wanted to take silicon valley and the west coast on it own term a a place where important thing in national security and intelligence and counterintelligence were occurring .
and year ago when i started going down this road this career path i began reaching out to folk who had spent year sometimes decade of working on intelligence and counterintelligence issue on the west coast and silicon valley in particular .
and some of those folk were active throughout the later decade of the cold war which wa a hugely important time in counterintelligence issue in silicon valley .
there wa a core or a cadre of folk who moved out to san francisco many of them from the east coast in the early to mid 70 and stayed together a a group for decade which created this interesting espri decor .
and they also developed a reputation a some of the best counterintelligence personnel that the bureau had nationally .
dc wa always thats the heart center of everything .
new york obviously had a lot going on but san francisco wa always considered cream of the crop when it came to fbi counterintelligence folk .
it is important to set that context the culture that wa there at the time within the bureau and this almost band of brother attitude that you had .
and having known rick for year weve had coffee on and off and he wa he wa willing to lean in and share a story that originated through some of his hard work running a very important counterintelligence campaign out of san francisco which is called operation entering .
and thats the genesis of my introduction to the story and to the world of rick and some of his fbi compatriot .
fantastic that you built that level of trust with those guy who are it sound they were very a closed circle almost i guess but then you were able to get to know them enough and get them to open up about something a fascinating a this .
after rick after you learned about this wa it difficult to develop the complete story ?
because you are only getting one perspective initially from the fbi the eyesight i take it .
i do not think i ever get the complete story especially a an intelligence reporter .
i do not ever believe that i have the complete story .
i do not even know if there is such a thing a a complete story .
i think not to wax too philosophical about it but i think that there always there a reason why they call it the wilderness of mirror .
there always gray area .
certainly with this story i felt i had a very good understanding from the bureau perspective .
i would have loved to have had the understanding from the soviet block side being able to potentially look at some of the soviet block archive related to this operation and how they viewed it would have been fascinating .
and then of course the main source that rick and the fbi used the fbi agent whom i spoke including rick were not they were not willing to share this person name with me .
and i wa unable to independently identify this person .
of course i would in theory that person perspective a . but all in all i wa very happy with the level of detail i wa able to provide because it is honestly it wa unusual for me and i think in general .
the whole story no certainly not .
but a level of granularity that i thought wa good and important a a historical example absolutely .
zach you are definitely preaching to the choir on that part .
i can not count the number of time here on the podcast .
ive said something along the line of well probably never know the rest of the story unfortunately .
i definitely picked the wrong niche to get into a an amateur historian trying to find out what happened at the bottom of thing .
but yeah absolutely endlessly fascinating topic .
and i do enjoy that little air of mystery thats in your article about the identity of the central figure of the article .
but it is a you read through it of course it is very understandable why they would not have revealed that information why that person would not have gone public themselves a well get into certainly .
we mentioned of course it is called operation entering .
what exactly wa it ?
what were the goal of operation entering ?
operation entering wa an fbi offensive counterintelligence operation that ran from the very early 1980s to about one thousand nine hundred and eighty three .
pretty significant amount of time .
and the objective wa to have somebody who wa under fbi control and fbi asset pretend to be a crooked businessman from silicon valley willing to sell the soviet block technology that wa dual use and export prohibited .
dual use mean that it ha both civilian and military or intelligence related uses. . and there wa a whole host of technology then a now that are prohibited to export to russia and the soviet block then and russia today .
and what the bureau did wa they they said look we know that the soviet and their ally are greedy for the cutting edge in american high tech .
and at the time that wa that wa microchip .
and then a now the russian were world leader in this ?
especially after the two thousand and twenty two full scale invasion of ukraine there wa another clampdown where there wa more sanction and the sanction on the russian .
and they also once again started engaging in the same they never stopped but it got much more intensive after the u.s. and it ally put the screw on russian importation of dual use good .
their reaction then wa very similar to their reaction postukraine ?
the bureau knew this and the bureau decided to go on the offensive .
and rick and his colleague decided what we are going to do is we are going to find somebody who going to be willing to pretend to be this crook and to sell the soviet and their ally technology that ha been sabotaged for tamper .
and there wa a whole bunch of reason why they decided to do that .
but that is the thats the view from tenzero foot of the operation .
it went on for year .
it wa very successful .
they managed to get the soviet block to purchase million of dollar in in tampered tampered u good .
and i am sure there lot of other operation of this sort that have been carried out over the year and executed .
but this is a rare example i think of a revelation in the public sphere about how the bureau thought about this stuff and a bureau success .
wa this a top down initiative or wa this something that rick developed himself or one of his coworkers there in san francisco developed themselves and sold from the bottom up to speak ?
this but for any listener a he doesnt know about farewell there wa a kgb officer who wa a senior officer who worked in moscow in the kgb st science and technology division .
his last name wa vetrov .
he wa recruited by the french .
he wa recruited by the french domestic service if i remember correctly which is interesting .
but he wa recruited by the french and he provided what became known a the farewell dossier .
and farewell wa the code name that the french gave to him .
farewell dossier wa an exhaustive list of all of the technology that the soviet and their ally had either stolen successfully or were looking to steal ?
it wa these were shopping list .
and what they did wa this is important for entering what the soviet did what the kgb did wa they had a list of stuff that they themselves were we are going to steal this stuff .
and then they also handed out shopping list to all the different allied soviet block service ?
entering focused on the east german and the bulgarian but you also have check the pole the hungarian .
there wa an understanding by the early 1980s of the extent of this problem ?
thats the world in which rick smith wa operating where the cia and of course the french then french intelligence passed the farewell dossier on to the cia .
the fbi knew the extent of the issue .
but this wa a case where this wa rick initiative ?
this wa rick initiative saying what there this guy i met him .
rick this all came together in a bar in san francisco ?
rick knew who this guy wa because he wa a he wa a entrepreneur .
he wa a silicon valley entrepreneur .
he wa austrian by nationality .
they knew he had tried to legally i went on our line legally drum up business with the soviet .
the bureau would routinely obviously surveil the soviet consulate in san francisco .
they realized that this guy wa going out of the consulate .
they determined that his his business objective were completely above board .
they approached him .
they said maybe you can work with u . it did not work .
nothing worked out .
thats fine .
stuff that happens .
and rick forgot all about him .
and then about a year later he run into this guy at a bar randomly .
and it is a great bar by the way .
it is called the galboa cafe .
it still exists .
if anybody is ever in san francisco it is worth a trip out to the calhalla neighborhood .
it is a beautiful historic bar .
and rick see this guy in the bar and strike up a conversation and start thinking himself what this guy ha the perfect background for being recruited by the fbi working with u and then pretending to be a crook ?
and that wa how interim all came together .
i talk about bill for hour .
bill wa bill wa an amazing guy who did extraordinary work for decade at the fbi office in san francisco all exclusively counterintelligence work .
rick and bill coran this case from san francisco .
yeah this wa an example of the initiative and daring do of the fbi folk in san francisco. . yeah it sound it .
and from that i guess you would say surprising beginning it spun up into something clearly enormous .
and what do you think that rick anticipated or wanted that at all at the time that he see this a the start of something huge ?
or wa this an opportunity that might be worth exploring ?
wanted it i am sure .
i am sure he wa thrilled at the time .
yeah i do not know .
beyond that i think i do not think it ever got too big .
i think it wa i think when you talk to rick about it i think it wa a complex operation .
and how much do you let through thats unadulterated ?
there wa a ton of stuff that these folk were thinking about at the time .
and it is amazing to me that they were able to run it for a long a they did .
and then of course there the concern about the health and safety of the source that you are using a . that wa a big part of it too .
i think i do not know if i answered your question but one thing that i walked away from and pressed by wa the complexity of the operation and the ability to pull something that off .
and it seems extremely difficult to manage .
and it is easy to see many way it could have gone terribly wrong .
their their risk assessment and their risk mitigation had to be very carefully thought out because you talk about they have to give some functional dual use technology to their greatest adversary of the time a part of a larger operation .
somebody ha to sign off on that .
somebody ha to explain clearly why this is ultimately of benefit to the united state and to the detriment of our adversary that thing .
yeah and i should i should also mention i spoke to somebody else for the story who wa also an extraordinary fbi counterintelligence agent .
also he retired retired for a long time a long time .
he retired for a long time .
his name is ed appel .
and ed oversaw the case from dc .
ed wa running the east german and bulgarian desk at fbi headquarters .
ed ha also had a extraordinary career in fbi counterintelligence .
and he it is interesting because ed perspective on this on this operation wa a little different because he wa he wa catching the brunt of the heat from dc about it .
rick wa running the operation .
he wa he wa out there in san francisco overseeing .
he wa flying around .
but the bureaucratic issue that arose i think ed felt those more tangibly .
and to give a couple of example there wa an interagency process that had to govern all of this .
there were called equity at play ?
the pentagon according to ed did not this operation .
they they he had to fight tooth and nail to keep this operation going because the pentagon wa wait what ?
pretty much exactly what you said .
the pentagon wa you are telling me that a good chunk of this stuff that could in theory assist soviet military capability you are going to let that go .
you are going to let you are going to let that stuff go through .
before we go on i want to tell you all about a new podcast from tenderfoot tv called to die for .
imagine you were a fly on the wall at a dinner between the mafia the cia and the kgb .
thats where this unprecedented podcast begin .
brought to you by the maker of the hit podcast to live and die in la .
to die for mark the first time a russian trained honey trap ha told her story from beginning to end .
taught to seduce men for their secret and sometimes their life .
alia rosa wa trained to believe that her body no longer belonged to her .
it belonged to the state .
she wa meticulously trained to be the perfect weapon able to seduce her target into compromising situation that have ended career and sometimes life .
from tenderfoot tv the studio that brought you up and vanished and to live and die in la .
make sure you check out to die for available beginning on march 26th wherever you get your podcast .
and of course the bureau said yeah we have to do that .
we have to for the ruse to be viable a certain percentage of it ha to work correctly .
and the pentagon apparently at the time did not that .
there wa the pentagon there wa commerce wa involved .
the doj and the attorney general wa involved because of course you need to create a waiver where you are saying look we know this guy is breaking this source .
the austrian this guy is breaking a lot of law and we need to allow him to keep breaking american law because he doing it on behalf of the u government .
that wa a interesting part of it too .
and also it i think a thing that i do not think your listener need to be reminded of but i think it is always it is important to underline it about the cliche or caricature of the u intelligence community and then the reality of it .
this is a case where there were many different layer of bureaucracy checking what wa going on with contending interest and making sure that there wa you had legal review from the doj side and you had assessment of potential damage on the pentagon side .
and then the bureau had multiple layer ?
and there wa there wa a lot of very high level interagency debate and discussion over this .
and to be honest frankly i found that reassuring because because i wa good this is sensitive and you do not want to have something this happen where it is one fbi agent in san francisco who doing this ?
this you had multiple layer of review and these contending perspective that allowed them to continue for a long a they could but i am sure also constrained them in certain way .
sure i can i can certainly see that .
wa the this operation wa a success by pretty much any measure but wa the overarching goal to i can see several potential here but wa it to get them to waste their limited fund on stuff that did not work ?
wa it to identify the supply chain and the personnel involved in getting restricted item over to soviet union or something else or a combination of everything ?
it wa all those thing .
look let go through it one by one because i think this is i think this is important to understand why these operation are run and that the multiple advantage that they can accrue .
a you said one way this doe it is it help you map out illegal importation network and intelligence officer and their asset that are involved in tech transfer and tech theft ?
thats advantage number one .
and another thing that i would love to have known about this story but i do not is what intelligence may have been passed from the bureau and the cia to partner abroad and ally abroad about hey guess what ?
you have a network problem here you have an issue in austria or in the netherlands or in switzerland ?
there there that stuff too .
thats thats one part of it .
the other part of it is a you mentioned you can start to map out a picture of what your adversary want and need and doesnt have and why they might want it ?
and that is a way of gathering intelligence which might be a little counterintuitive but can be very very valuable ?
because you do not know what necessarily all of the intelligence requirement on the st side are for your adversary until you are figuring out precisely what they are asking for .
thats another thats another big advantage of it .
the third advantage which you also mentioned is that especially in those day but today a hard currency is valuable ?
you are draining your adversary coffer ?
you are you are forcing them to spend u dollar in the many million ?
when that that also imposes a cost on them .
and then of course you are theoretically arresting or retarding their st research and development .
and i want to i want to underline something here which is the soviet bloc in entering wasnt asking for microchip .
they were also asking for a highly specialized computer production equipment and technology ?
they wanted to steal the tech reverse engineer the tech build factory that would then allow them to replicate the tech ?
because thats a lot easier .
there a certain point you do not want to steal microchip by the hundred ?
you want to steal the design what the chinese do today .
and then you want to build a factory that produce it .
and thats what they were trying to do .
some of the technology that wa sabotaged were these highly specialized computer production tool .
there is some evidence that i wa able to piece together about the success of this ?
because the main east bloc agency that the fbi reeled in were the bulgarian .
and i found some evidence from a bulgarian academic who go back through his country cold war archive .
and around the exact same time that entering wa going on there wa a secret agreement between the kgb and the bulgarian intelligence service where the kgb told the bulgarian you need to get u this computer production equipment .
once you get that equipment for u we are going to build computer production factory in russia in russia proper .
and we are going to indigenously produce this stuff .
now according to the academic research that i found they did in fact put this factory together but it wa beset by a lot of delay .
now maybe that wa because of entering maybe that wa because of other thing .
and by the time the factory got up and running the technology that they were supposed to produce wa completely absolute .
now look i do not know for one hundred fact that that wa because of entering but this is this is another data point that strongly suggests the overall success of that operation .
endless frustration for the other side .
do you happen to know what percentage a an example of functional stuff had to be sent over ?
i am imagining after a couple of shipment where practically everything is garbage that they start to get suspicious or at the very least frustrated pretty quickly .
i do not know the exact percentage but i do know that again i do not know the percentage this either but a percentage of the tech wa not sabotaged .
it wa shipped clean .
a percentage of it wa sabotaged in a way to make it appear it wa normal wear and tear you get an amazon package and you are hey what the hell ? .
and some of it wa made to look there wa a problem with the shipment .
we are the bureau replaced it with sandbag .
it look something something got messed up in the in the intermediary step ?
because you had in order to in order to keep the ultimate end user a recipient of these these shipment hidden what the soviet block did then .
and of course the russian the chinese the iranian etc .
do today is you create all these different trans shipper all over the world to to hide the ultimate the ultimate recipient .
sometimes the stuff did not get there .
and then sometimes the stuff wa altered in a way that wa imperceptible ?
and i suspect strongly that wa probably in the shipment that dealt with production production tool themselves ?
where these are testing tool to make sure that the chip are working correctly or everything is calibrated perfectly and finally .
and you create some you do something that alters the thing that is that calibrates it to a certain extent .
even an expert in a factory in russia or elsewhere in the eastern bloc might not might not see or understand that something ha been subtly altered ?
and thats thats the way you keep an operation going and then subtly and subtly and systematically degrade the production capability of an adversary ?
if you think about it that is an amazing way over time to degrade an adversary .
and i think that wa also in the mix .
yeah very very clever .
and that brings up a great point .
wa that the fbi agent themselves manipulating this technology ?
or did they have to bring in the producer themselves and buy sabotage equipment or hire contractor or something ?
how did that work exactly ?
yeah there some there some there some muddiness there for me .
and one thing that is not muddy ill say is that the company themselves had no idea .
they were not they were not winning party to any of this .
and that introduces some interesting ethical question a . but i think this is all done because what happened wa you had these american company cule packard for instance wa one of them .
and they sold stuff to american distributor .
and then x number of step later it would find it way to the eastern bloc ?
they had no idea because they were never selling .
these american producer were never selling directly to the eastern bloc .
they had no direct role in the scheme .
they had no knowledge of the scheme .
the second part of your question it is a interesting one .
there were specialized u government technician that were brought in to help sabotage this high tech .
i do not know if they were fbi .
i think they came from multiple agency .
some of that work wa done in london a part of entering but i do not i do not know precisely who did it .
i know that it is not rick himself or bill himself bill wa doing it ?
these are fbi case agent ?
they do not they did not have the technical skill or understanding to do that work which is extraordinarily specialized .
i think there are folk in nsa for instance who have that skill set .
and cia who have that skill set .
and i do not know for certain but i would have if i were a betting person i would bet that there wa some involvement there .
that make perfect sense .
but it also it also speaks to the size and the breadth of this that you have many organization and only one of them ha to have some leak .
a of course occurred many time to sabotage the operation .
the sabotage operation could be sabotaged a . yeah look it is amazing .
they kept it going a long a they kept it going .
i think it wa something that they recognize the value of they realized that it wa very complex .
they did not want to jeopardize it while it wa going on .
and they kept a tight lid on it .
i think look i do not know if this is a known not to get to rumsfeldian but i do not know if this is a it is a known unknown .
i think we do not know or at least i do not .
we do not know how many of these operation never get into the public sphere .
i think the vast majority never get into the public sphere a a reporter .
i it when thing get in the public sphere .
i learning about them .
i think they are fascinating .
i think some of them are i think they are illustrative and important for different reason .
but we do not know .
i spoke to other folk about there have been other sort of these operation that have that have occurred over the year .
i know that much for a fact .
there been some reporting about different operation of this sort targeting iran and north korea much more recently .
and i could say independently that i am aware of stuff on the iranian side but i am very happy that the american system is an open one .
but i also think that i think very little of this stuff ever get out .
yeah i would i would certainly imagine that to be true which is unfortunate for reporter and amateur historian myself .
but it is the nature of the game .
but it certainly help you keep your interest .
i am curious the middleman that you mentioned the unidentified austrian did this turn into him essentially every time he had to go meet the his contact ?
wa he having to apologize for the last shipment ?
to speak hey i am sorry that half of that did not work but i promise we fixed the error .
anything that wa this a and wa the pressure intensifying over time for him a the front man ?
i do not think i think at first thing were going quite smoothly .
i think there wa there wa an expectation that some thing would not .
i think there wa an expectation by the bulgarian and the russian that look there going to be some .
there going to be some room for error when you are when you are running a transnational sanction evasion scheme importing sense of technology. . i think i think that for a while they were quite happy and they got a bunch of stuff .
some of it wa unadulterated and some of the stuff that wa sabotaged i think they did not realize wa sabotaged .
my understanding from rick and others is that they were very very pleased .
and i think most of their i think this this business person is austrian .
i think most of the meeting that they had that he had with the soviet block operative were a neutral terrain ?
switzerland or austria then classic cold war locale .
at some point my understanding is that i think i think one thousand nine hundred and eighty three or they became suspicious and they asked him to meet them in bulgaria behind the iron curtain .
and the austrian told rick and the fbi about the request and the suspicion .
and rick and the bureau said absolutely not .
you are not going and this operation is complete because clearly they had their suspicion about you .
it is not safe for you to go there .
any subsequent shipment would be scrutinized to an extent that it would be clear immediately that something wa wrong .
everything went very very until it went very wrong .
but a far a thing go thats pretty good ?
because their source never went behind the iron curtain and they decided to pull the plug .
and they had a successful run and then they decided that time wa up and the time wa up .
ed appel the former fbi counterintelligence agent from dc who helped run the case .
he waxed philosophical about it in a way that i thought wa interesting .
he said look these thing all have a half life ?
you can not run an operation this forever .
they are complex .
there always these tradeoff .
there always worry about your source .
the opposite side always ha it antenna up .
and he said look these thing they have to end sometime .
and there wa no sense from anybody who ran the operation that the ending wa premature .
it it worked until it wa over. . yeah it sound a pretty successful wrap up overall .
and speaking of the austrian did he stay on the payroll after that to speak ?
or wa that the end of his relationship with the fbi a far a ?
thats it .
a far a i know he worked with them and he helped them out and he got paid a a source .
and he got he wa making money off of these transfer too .
he wa a businessman .
and that wa part of the deal ?
it wa the fbi did not did not seize the profit that he made .
he made a profit working with the soviet bloc and then he wa also being paid by the bureau .
and then of course after the operation ended he could no longer he could no longer engage in an economic intercourse with the soviet bloc because it wa illegal immediately the moment that operation ended .
and he wa no longer being paid by the bureau .
he went back to being a businessman who apparently ended up being a very very successful businessman .
there wa a happy ending for him there too .
yeah it certainly sound it .
and i know that you mentioned in the story a that there wa some concern about him .
and i do not know how founded it wa but the fbi in a sense they had engineered this perfect established black marketeer kingpin guy and then they had to cut him loose .
boy i hope he doesnt use that for himself in the future .
they look they were worried about that and not not him doing that in the future but then also while they were running the operation because they are we can not keep tab on this guy all the time .
we do not know if there are side deal or other thing that he engaged in ?
because we are we are giving him u government cover to engage to trade with the enemy .
and there wa always concern there i do not think it wa ever founded i think it wa i think but nonetheless one human nature two counterintelligence professional can be untrusting paranoid .
it is it is a professional benefit to an extent ?
there a way of looking at the world .
and i think that there wa concern there over time .
and i think there wa probably some relief on the bureau end to say what we wrapped this operation up in a way that it did not blow up in our face .
and there wa never any evidence of this guy double dealing .
did not he do it with libya ?
did not he start selling stuff to libya ?
he wa not fully out of the agency to a certain extent anyway .
pretty murky story there but he definitely realized that what he wa already doing for the u government he could also do a a private citizen and make a heck of a lot more money out of it apparently .
because it is wa he wa he an ex cia officer who wa providing intelligence ?
wa he being tasked by the agency ?
what wa the extent and depth of the relationship ?
wa there any wa there any money ?
wa he a paid source ?
wa he this is a murky world .
and of course these are big issue today too ?
do you have a lot of ex ex cia folk and ex ic folk who go abroad and do work abroad and still maintain some some do not .
i do not the whole there no such thing a an ex cia officer .
thats not true .
but thats thats not true .
emphatically thats not true .
but there is contact between some and there and i think it get very very murky ?
and we had case with i think it wa nsa personnel in the gulf in particular ?
where they are starting to work with foreign government .
and it is but if they are keeping some connection to the usg side it make it brings up ethical issue .
and certainly legal one that that make it very hard to prosecute individual if they have a ongoing relationship with former employer .
on the subject of the soviet and the bulgarian all of them or were they all outside of the u ?
you mentioned the third country neutral ground meeting and all that .
wa there anyone at the end of this to png out of the united state or anything that ?
or did they continue on having lost this battle ?
a far a i understand it the bulgarian intelligence officer around the operation were europe based .
there were bulgarian intelligence officer who were also indicted but i do not think they were ever they were never tried .
but there were bulgarian intelligence officer who were indicted in the very least in southern california .
and i do not think i do not think there were any pngs or arrest of foreign intelligence officer .
the only folk i know who were who were brought to justice in the legal system were i think the folk i previously mentioned the u side folk who were violating export control ban .
but a prosecution is only a small piece of these operation ?
and sometimes it ha no part of it .
sometimes prosecution ha nothing to do with counterintelligence operation and they exist in a different zone entirely .
this one the very fact that there wa any prosecution that arose at all make it i think unusual .
i can not say i am surprised but it is fascinating that folk were charged at all .
yeah this is an incredible story zach .
and you did great work bringing it to light finally after all this time .
for those of you listening if you want to read zachs story well link it up in the show note when this episode come out .
it is on politico.com now .
look for zach dorfmans most recent article .
fascinating stuff zach .
are you already working on something new now ?
whats next on the horizon for you ?
i got multiple thing .
there is a story that ive been working on for year that will be out by monday .
it is in rolling stone magazine .
and i am still still slightly paranoid about talking about it before it is out .
but it is a story about it is a war on terror story essentially .
and it is a story about somebody within cia who did some extraordinary thing and wa fetid for those extraordinary thing but then came home and had some very significant psychological or mental health issue related to the work they did .
and the story is about the work and program that this person engaged in at the agency .
and then also what happened to them when they came back and whether they got the care they needed .
and the larger question surrounding the care and the state of the very specific program that this person wa engaged in .
it is coming out .
it should be out sunday .
by the time people are listening to this it should be out in rolling stone .
and it is a story that i am very very proud of .
it is it is not the easiest reading admittedly .
but i think that it is it is something that if i dare say it i think it is an important story and something that i hope get a conversation going about how we care for folk that do very very difficult deep cover work .
wow zach you certainly know how to set the hook .
i will give you that .
because i am very interested .
i look forward to that .
and then and thats i think thats an incredible accomplishment .
honestly two major major story this on two different subject dropping in a two week period .
thats thats impressive work .
thats pure happenstance .
that is pure happenstance .
that is stuff that these are these story that i have been diligently piecing together for year .
and they happened randomly to appear on back to back weekend .
but these are reporting these out a molasses and then writing them a the same .
i am happy that they are out in the world .
and if you you want to talk about the rolling stone story or any or any other story justin id be more than happy to come back .
yeah fantastic .
thats i will take you up on that definitely because this ha been a great conversation .

welcome to the consulting technology podcast brought to you by cognacor.com where we explore the intersection of technology consulting and industry challenge .
i am your host john kerr joined a always by our resident expert dr. samuel z. today we are excited to welcome joseph keller a business advisor in the health insurance industry and a specialist in area valuebased care network analytics and claim analytics .
joseph is deeply passionate about making healthcare more accessible and affordable and we are thrilled to have him here to discus ai and healthcare today .
this is our conversation .
joseph thank you for joining u today .
your background in software and data is impressive especially with your focus on reducing healthcare cost and improving access to underserved community .
can you tell u a little bit about what led you down this path in healthcare analytics software development and altruism ?
thanks for having me .
i started out working for a provider and getting the broad business background on how healthcare is financed and what drive strategy from a contracting perspective .
and then when you get to see when you work for a large system you are going to get to see a much more broader point of view in the sense of you are not focused on one small area .
you get to see an entire state or how policy and thing affect the entire country .
and ive done everything from the commercial space to a little bit of the government stuff .
medicare and medicaid most of what ive done is on the commercial side .
and from there i realized that this is ten year ago i realized that compared to some of the tech hub around the united state that healthcare wa definitely definitely in it infancy a far a tool how they process thing the analytics on and forth .
and since then ive seen a lot more investment in creating little software shop within organization .
and naturally that wa something that i wa interested in because one of the big challenge of healthcare is the administrative side of thing how many people you need to do certain kind of task .
and it seemed inevitable that those thing will converge weve seen in software .
when i first started in software we used to have an entire team dedicated to doing release .
and now they call that devops .
people before used to not be full stack developer .
it seemed that thats the natural order of thing that thing will converge .
and i thought there wa some interesting opportunity to be creative and create thing from the ground up .
joe in particular why do you think the healthcare industry ha been slower than other industry to adopt say analytics ?
we know obviously ai there regulatory reason and thing that around ai a . but a an industry why do you think healthcare is generally slower to adopt emerging technology and say other industry ?
the easiest thing to point to is electronic health record .
it wasnt a mandate until i think eight or nine .
if you compare that to banking or other industry that have been doing it since the 80 or 90 it is not a part of the normal day to day when we are thinking about data and what is the data say .
health insurance company i think have been doing it a little longer than say provider .
and because they are bigger when you are talking about a fortune forty company they are talking about million and million of provider where a big system in a state is not even anywhere near that .
electronic health record definitely have played a piece into it .
and then the skill set ?
a technology ha emerged in the last twenty twenty five year the top talent doesnt think of how they want to go into healthcare .
they think i want to go on wall street .
i want to make facebook or whatever .
and naturally it is been slow .
those two thing converging electronic health record still be in the beginning the talent .
and then probably the data itself a lot of stuff how claim get adjudicated the data thats there different system how they talk to each other .
historically speaking there been a lot of those merger and claim engine and whatnot they do thing differently .
and there hasnt been an integration to look at a a billion dollar level company to streamline that data .
the data is very messy ha a lot of gap .
and it is very hard to do analytics .
not only that with the regulation and behavior you can predict much easier to say if you put an item on a shelf more people are going to look at that .
with healthcare you do not know when people are going to be sick .
it is not a binary a retail sale or i to use the analogy of a car how do when your car is going to break down ?
it break down when it break down .
healthcare is difficult in that sense that you are dealing with many different thing that can happen in the body .
and from an analytics point of view how do you relate that to some economic strategy ?
it is it is it is difficult .
would you say that the economics of it being that it is not well always you look at historically at least area entertainment often get huge investment from venture capital and thing this because in the short term there no cap on how much money it can make ?
you do not usually see public good entity getting the same investment or the same attention from investor .
do you think that the purely the economics of say healthcare drive that slower adoption of emerging technology ?
your question is do the economics create a barrier for healthcare company to adopt those technology ?
yeah are there a lot of startup healthcare technology in term of sheer number say compared to video game or gambling or streaming or something this where it doe seem always there another one of those company always being funded ?
i do not at least my knowledge i do not see the same growth in the healthcare space or these other industry .
yeah it is definitely a huge barrier to entry .
and then if you think about some of the largest company in the world a lot of them are insurance company .
how do you become a facebook and take on i think some of the bigger publicly traded company are in the three to five hundred billion in revenue .
i guess it is not an easy thing to disrupt .
whereas creating a game or betting is more about how do you get eyeball on something ?
the economics are different and definitely more challenging from a healthcare point of view in term of vc .
if i wa a vc i would maybe yeah thats a tough one .
maybe yeah maybe the economics are difficult .
i do not know that space enough .
i know there company out there now they are there they have their own investment side of thing where they are investing in startup .
at the rate of new company being started maybe it is maybe it is a smaller smaller thing .
or there were much more low hanging fruit with video game in term of the roi .
and now they are starting to maybe move on to something more interesting or difficult .
in term of ai in particular is there any common or cultural fear you get when talking to leader ?
in the healthcare space around ai ?
is there any either cultural element to it or emotional element that are that are where leader particularly in the healthcare space or the healthcare insurance space that are skeptical of ai or thing this ?
or how are when you discus this with leader how are they reacting ?
they are definitely very careful and very risk adverse because because of any data or anything ai related .
it is impacting people .
and the law that are surrounded around it the hip of compliance and thing that .
they are very more careful about how they go about figuring out strategy .
it is definitely baby step because of all those constraint .
in term of the constraint that you are dealing with you think that it is a more of a regulatory constraint say for example hipaa ?
or do you think that it is something different maybe it is more of an economic constraint or a cultural constraint ?
or is it more of the issue of the economics do not encourage the adoption of these emerging technology ?
i wouldnt say the government necessarily creates slows down the desire .
there definitely a huge desire .
it is more understanding the value proposition and doe it increase in efficiency or lower the balance sheet ?
it ha to make dollar and cent .
and to change that could be a huge operational risk because it could be slow .
i to point always back to the labor .
labor may be a little bit more adverse to changing how they want to do thing .
how is ai going to do it ?
the adoption there can be tricky .
and then it is very expensive .
their provider business model is not in software development .
they have a brick and mortar hospital or an office .
and to add software and ai into that is completely outside of their normal skill set .
for an insurance company i think it is a challenge to find the talent in order to solve certain business problem .
the business problem can be tricky because the data is not super intuitive to understand .
everybody can understand how clicking and retail sale can work on the healthcare side of thing .
it can be challenging .
and then from a doctor point of view i think there a battle between old school and new school on adoptability .
wheres the liability ?
if i am a dermatologist and i am using scan and a report from an ai tool am i making the decision ?
or is the doctor making the decision ?
is the tool augmenting in helping them do that ?
and if how doe that relate to dollar and cent ?
is a doctor going to pay more for this tool ?
they went to medical school .
is the insurance company going to make money by providing this tool ?
that mean that they have to get a discount .
the doctor not going to take le money .
there may be a lot of good idea .
they may not add up to some dollar and cent at the end of the day .
and most of the tool that i see are operational efficiency trying to figure out how to lower the drag of processing claim or internally how to make sure thing get routed to the person .
and those are the low hanging fruit a of now .
i recently saw a thread on reddit .
they have a subreddit called ama .
it mean ask me anything .
and the team from chatgpt joined sometime last week .
and they did one for the big launch of chatgpt4o .
i think somebody whod cured themselves of a rare illness by being able to diagnose themselves when the doctor hadnt noticed it .
i wondered if you had seen any interesting application of ai in health care or health insurance that youd to share ?
on medicine itself i think there a lot more opportunity in term of research whether you are talking about cancer or assisting people in their own diagnosis behavior health mental health .
i think those are more interesting avenue .
we did get microsoft come in and show u how they are using it in some medical research .
and it seemed promising of some of the finding that they were able to do with the human eye .
with ai being able to look at all kind of different variable simultaneously i think grandmaster chest people have eight or ten variable in their head .
and if with ai you can throw that much more data and ask the gpt to give some insight and then tweak it .
and there were more thing from the research side .
i think pharmaceutical speaking that can definitely help out .
and a processing get cheaper that what that translates to is cheaper drug lower cost for the consumer .
and i think there a very clear economic formula there for medicine itself .
operationally i think there opportunity too a i wa mentioning about claim and making sure thing get done quicker paying correctly that thing .
and then a far a the medicine i know they are doing thing with estimating when someone likely going to have a heart attack .
maybe that help the patient have a light bulb moment where they say i need to change my behavior .
i do not think that that will necessarily translate very easily to see there cost saving .
in the value based care space they look at thing to say hey doctor if you diagnose keep on track of people who have diabetes or these kind of risk this is more valuable .
what thats supposed to do then is translate to lower cost and lower saving or more saving .
the question is who realizing those saving and what are we saying when we say the cost are going down ?
from a doctor point of view they are saying hey i did something more valuable you should pay me more .
thats not saving anybody any money if the doctor is having to get paid more .
me a a consumer i have to pay more in a premium .
and a a health plan that mean i am going to have to charge more to my customer .
the tricky part is then is where is the risk ?
is the risk on the doctor ?
because if their patient then seem to have more problem at some point maybe one or two or three year down the road do they get le money ?
is it on the consumer side to say hey if you do not do these thing then we are going to price your health at a different premium ?
thats not discussed widely but that is a consideration when designing product .
and then from the health plan side of thing they are using it a more of a payment mechanism to say hey well increase your payment but we are going to tie it a more of an incentive bonus .
and we are not going to guarantee the increase unless we see some certain kind of result and outcome and measuring .
and you have that component and then you have the infrastructure behind the scene .
you have team of fifty to one hundred people monitoring and developing report and methodology .
and you are wheres the real saving coming from ?
it is a challenge because it is not clear that you would have saved money had you done something else because thats more of a different reality that we measure against .
the saving it is hard for an accountant to look at where the saving hit the balance sheet .
and those are why valuebased care ha faded especially since covid .
many of our listener are in the consulting space or they are in a talent management space and thing this .
in regard to the health care industry broadly particularly for folk in the technology space though one of the growing sector we are seeing a lot in the consulting space now is a data governance area or some regulatory data analyst or regulatory data expert thing this .
is that a particular area of growth you think in the health care industry is the job of the data governance expert or the legal data expert or something that ?
you are given the large amount of regulation in the health care space ?
i think governance would be more internally .
when you have large organization you need to figure out how you are going to sell something how you are going to market something how you are going to implement something and then the data strategy behind that .
the governance come from more when these request are made .
do you have enough resource and capacity to a intake all those request and then b to then figure out how to prioritize them ?
because you can not spend ... you only have much money to spend you have to figure out way of prioritizing that .
and then from there then once the implementation go live then you need to be able to track and monitor it .
believe it or not there not a lot of infrastructure in place to even create a ... to create visibility into how the business is performing .
i wa asked one time a long time ago about if we had data to measure how effective request were to join a product something that something a product or did they join this thing ?
and i said yeah did you guy send it out and have a way of tracking and creating that data ?
and they were no we thought based on the claim youd be able to tell me that .
and i am the claim doesnt have anything related to this flyer that you sent out. ?
and thinking about how data is created to then measuring it on the back end that end to end thing is very sporadic depending upon the organization you talk about or have experience with .
these same consultant who are say looking to work with healthcare organization healthcare insurance organization group this or provide service to these organization what are the primary skill set that these organization are looking to get from their consultant or from their external third party ?
is it more technical skill ?
is it more of the relationship building of a long term relationship ?
where would you put that the skill are needed now ?
i think it is more getting competitor data trying to understand where they are positioned and where they are not .
it could be it could be when you are talking about evaluating doctor or health system who is high quality ?
what doe that mean ?
can we be objective ?
do we have a large enough sample to be pretty confident and to have result that we can measure against ?
a lot of time organization can only look inward .
they can say based on what we have thats not necessarily representative of the entire market or the geography thats being discussed .
there are a lot of company out there that become data broker essentially .
and they have to be very good and be able to sell their story a lot better by saying we are we do know what we are talking about .
we have these certification of quality et cetera .
thats the challenge for consultant and organization to make those decision .
in term of the fact that many healthcare organization often either have a nonprofit bent to them or they are heavily regulated they have some other funding bent to them thing this .
is there any particular adoption or way to accelerate say ai adoption in this space ?
from the government point of view thats a little bit outside of my expertise .
maybe they could use it to figure out how they reimburse .
because government program are funded based on tax they see a trend for service go up they adjust the payment based on that .
that could be helpful in figuring out are they spreading the money across the entire state or in case of medicare appropriately ?
should they pas legislation to require more access and would there be a way of figuring out if they could help folk that are retired or folk that are under the poverty level ?
maybe those are the play .
i do not have much experience with that .
what conversation are people having about ai around you at the moment ?
is it still very novel or are they picking up the pace or complexity ?
what is the opinion of ai in the workplace ?
i think it is conversation are definitely accelerating and there is a heavy interest and a heavy investment in it .
it might be a little shortsighted in the sense that i think ultimately what the play is for large organization is to give people tool to either make them more productive making sure that they are not wasting time doing other thing that are otherwise unproductive .
and also to not have to rely on a much on the labor talent .
if they can develop tool that can allow people to do thing quicker and faster then more governance job other thing would other type of role would be created to support those thing to support the business .
and i think thats thats how i only thats the only way i see it working is tempering the liability on the balance sheet a far a labor .
one of the thing i read a lot about is how generative ai can be adopted in regulated industry .
and healthcare is usually one of the main one we hear about .
in term of say analyst engineer it professional who work in healthcare work in healthcare analytics and healthcare insurance and thing this do you think that these professional will be able to adopt generative ai a part of their job anytime soon ?
or hipaa is the number one thing i hear about is that if they have a data set theyd to analyze but it is full of healthcare data they can not give this to an ai ?
and to say hey i am an upload a data set and ask you question about it ?
or ask for recommendation in term of either procedure or medical advice or thing that based on the data set you upload because the data set themselves are often either not deidentified they have a lot of sensitive private information in them .
do in the coming year that this problem will be solved or were you think that these analyst these engineer who work in the healthcare space will they be able to use generative ai and give these system patient data or at least patient related data at some point ?
i think they do already .
it is more of a tool than a full automation to have it do thing .
and whether it be on the claim side making sure that thing get routed correctly finding claim are complicated and not complicated .
the idea is is i see this i should measure it against what the expectation payment is and then pay it .
a lot of time thing will be missing information thats needed or the claim engine will flag thing .
and who doe that go to ?
how doe it how doe the transaction back and forth with the with the provider ?
how doe that work ?
and the tool would be to look at that operational process and make sure that the generative ai know where to send thing be able to explain very in plain simple english what the issue is .
and i see generative ai being a being helpful in that sense of speeding up the claim turnaround and then being able to articulate in either plain english or some way thats intuitive not in order to make sure that that thing are being processed correctly .
thank you .
and before we wrap up the show this is the moment where we get our crystal ball out and try to look forward into the future .
i wa wondering if you had any opinion or idea about change that you might anticipate over the next five year .
are there any indicator or signal about a specific direction thing might be heading ?
a it relates to healthcare what would be what would be amazing is if the transparency side of thing i think president trump signed some legislation in there .
i think it would be better for the consumer not necessarily better for the business if they were able to understand and have an expectation about what certain thing would cost until you have a child you do not know what your how your product work .
and it would be nice to have a tool to say hey based on this provider that i am thinking about going to how much would it cost me to have a baby based on my current deductible and and all the thing that are involved .
and i think that would be interesting to for people to get more involved in understanding about i am curious maybe i should get a ct scan to make sure i am almost forty and maybe thats a good thing .
and then all of a sudden you are it is going to cost me eight hundred .
maybe thats not necessary .
i think from those point if you are getting the customer more engaged would be the best thing .
and i think gen ai can simplify some of those those hurdle .
thank you .
if you were asked by the healthcare company or key stakeholder that were perhaps a bit reluctant to move towards ai and you had an opportunity to convince them or you had an opportunity to fight in it corner what would you say to them ?
say if you are if you are adverse to change it is coming the biggest company out there they see they see the benefit and they are actively spending mega dollar to figure it out .
and you are either going to get smaller or get or get bought if you do not adopt .
this is a very interesting conversation .
thank you for speaking with today joe .
i think healthcare pose a particularly interesting environment for emerging technology given the constraint .
it is not a linear process of we improve the product we get more return on our investment maybe some other industry are .
it ha this very multiple actor have staked in this and they do not necessarily have the same motivation which i think is very interesting .
and that pose a particular challenge from a network effect standpoint on the adoption of emerging technology .
yeah that is that is the challenge in this country insurance company provider and customer are all have very different motivation .
and even across the same insurance company they have different motivation because they are positioned differently same with provider .
if you are very big you are going to behave very differently than if you are very small .
and even one that are similar size .
to get everybody to agree on simple thing is a lot harder than people understand and realize .
and unfortunately it is about dollar and cent .
and to go back to the car analogy ?
how do you how do you keep car repair a cheap a possible ?
is the mechanic responsible for it ?
thats the doctor .
is the owner of the vehicle ?
how much respond ?
how responsible are they ?
and on top of that beyond the car analogy we are talking about people that have to deal with life and death situation .
and the way the industry is incentivized is to deal with the problem a they come instead of try to prevent that .
and how do you shift the economics from that model to something else given the complexity of the environment ?
it make it it make it make it interesting on a day to day basis .
thank you much for sharing your insight with u today .
it is clear you are passionate about your position on your linkedin page .
it say working with a smile .
i would love to give that a recommendation a tick definitely working with a smile .
i wanted to express my gratitude for you joining u on the consulting technology podcast today .
it is been a pleasure .
and good luck with your future endeavor .
thank you very much joseph for being here today .
i think our listener appreciate the insight into adoption emerging technology in the healthcare space and particularly the critical issue it ha regarding the different stakeholder and the different priority they have .
it is very interesting .
i think to our listener both in the should be in the business world who are working for major company but also from a consulting standpoint i think there a lot of key issue here that consultant can definitely bring up .
and thats going to deal with healthcare provider .

thank you .
all everybody welcome to another deep dive .
today we are tackling a topic that quite honestly sends shiver down the spine of anyone who ever touched a computer .
this one a doozy .
we are talking ransomware but with a twist .
buckle up because this deep dive take u straight into the heart of a major cybersecurity vulnerability that rocked the very foundation of the digital backup world .
hit the nail on the head there .
this is a story about trust or rather what happens when that trust is shattered because at the center of it all is veeam a name synonymous with data protection relied upon by business big and small across the globe .
and when a company veeam known for safeguarding our digital kingdom reveals a critical vulnerability it is time to pay attention .
and this is not some theoretical threat we are talking about .
this vulnerability officially designated a cve two thousand and twenty four four.seven wa actively exploited by multiple ransomware gang before a patch even existed .
wait hold on .
they knew about this weakness and were already using it against unsuspecting business ?
it is a stark reminder that in the digital world there are force constantly probing searching for any crack in our defense .
let break this down for everyone .
what exactly wa this veeam vulnerability and how did it potentially expose business to ransomware attack ?
in the simplest term imagine someone handing over the key to your backup fold .
thats essentially what this flaw allowed .
hacker could exploit it remotely gaining unauthorized access to a company entire backup infrastructure .
even if you had all your data neatly backed up thinking you were protected these guy could waltz in and either steal it or hold it hostage .
thats exactly why this particular vulnerability is alarming .
ransomware at it core relies on fear and leverage .
it cripple your access to critical data and then demand a hefty ransom for it release .
and backup are supposed to be our safety net in these situation ?
our way to say no thanks to these digital extortionist .
but when that safety net is compromised the whole game change .
suddenly business are left with an impossible choice .
they are pay up or face the prospect of losing invaluable data potentially crippling their operation .
thats a terrifying position to be in .
weve got business big and small trusting veeam with our data completely unaware that this vulnerability could leave them wide open to attack .
and what make it even scarier is that the attacker exploiting this werent your run of the mill hacker .
we are talking sophisticated organized ransomware gang .
the kind with resource and know how to slip past even the toughest offense .
this is already sounding a cyber thriller movie and i am not sure i the plot .
unfortunately this is the reality we live in and this veeam vulnerability is a stark reminder of how high the stake are .
these ransomware gang they are not some teenager in a basement ?
these are the pro .
we are talking about highly organized often multinational criminal enterprise .
theyve got the resource theyve got the expertise and honestly it is scary how they operate with almost a business efficiency .
i wa going to say it is their business model is built on exploiting these weakness and preying on fear .
exactly theyve honed their tactic constantly adapting to new defense and yeah sadly they are incredibly effective at what they do .
knowing that these are the player involved what doe this mean for business who maybe because of this veeam vulnerability find themselves staring down the barrel of a ransomware attack ?
the first thing that come to mind is the financial hit ?
those ransom demand can be massive sometimes hundred of thousand even million of dollar .
and for some business that alone could be crippling .
without a doubt especially for smaller business that financial blow it could be absolutely devastating .
but it is not about the ransom itself ?
there a whole domino effect that come with a ransomware attack .
you are absolutely .
you hit the nail on the head .
think about it .
business are forced to halt operation their system are down they can not serve customer they can not process order .
it is hitting a giant pause button on their entire operation .
and the longer that pause button is held down the more the loss pile up .
you are getting it .
the financial impact it spiral outwards lost revenue missed deadline potential legal fee reputational damage .
it is a nightmare scenario .
reputational damage yeah thats a whole other beast ?
it is once trust is broken it is incredibly hard to rebuild .
it is .
in today hyperconnected world news of a data breach spread wildfire .
customer partner investor they all start questioning your security practice .
and rightfully .
if i heard a company i do business with got hit by ransomware id definitely think twice .
and rebuilding that trust it take time it take transparency and it take a serious commitment to bolstering your cybersecurity posture .
the picture you are tainting it is not pretty .
but let try and shift gear a bit .
veeam did release a patch patch twelve.two to be specific to address this vulnerability .
thats the immediate action everyone should take if you are using veeam update your system yesterday .
yeah thats got to be step one for sure .
but i think it is important to emphasize that patching alone it is not a magic bullet .
it is locking your front door .
it is a good start but it is not going to stop a determined burglar .
exactly you need a multilayered security approach a combination of proactive measure and reactive strategy to protect yourself .
we are talking layer of security a digital fortress if you will .
what are some of the building block we need to consider here ?
a good place to start is access control .
it is having a strict bouncer at the door of your data center .
you got to make sure only authorized personnel have access to your critical system especially your backup infrastructure .
strong password ridiculously long one with all the weird character those are nonnegotiables ?
strong and unique password are a must but we can not stop there .
this is where multifactor authentication come in .
the twofactor thing ?
where you need a code from your phone or email on top of your password ?
it add that extra layer of security making it exponentially harder for attacker to gain unauthorized access even if they somehow manage to snag your password .
because then they need your phone too and good luck getting past my lock screen .
it is all about making it a difficult a possible for the bad guy forcing them to expend more time and resource and hopefully making them reconsider altogether .
weve got our fortress wall our multifactor moat .
what else can we do to beef up our defense ?
do not set it and forget it .
youve got to keep an eye on thing .
actively monitor your system and backup log for any sign of suspicious activity unauthorized access attempt anything out of the ordinary .
having security camera and motion sensor but for our digital asset ?
thats a great analogy .
think of it a an early warning system giving you a chance to react quickly and potentially mitigate damage if something fishy is going on .
i am seeing the importance of staying vigilant .
but even with all these precaution sometimes those worst case scenario they still happen ?
thats where that disaster recovery plan come in .
no system is foolproof no matter how many layer of security you have in place .
thats why having a solid disaster recovery plan is crucial .
it is having an insurance policy for your data .
and this plan it is not about saying yeah well figure it out if something happens .
it is got to be detailed ?
you need a clear stepbystep plan outlining exactly what to do in case of a ransomware attack or any major disruption .
how will you restore your data ?
how will you communicate with your employee your customer the authority ?
these are all thing you need to have figured out beforehand .
because in the heat of the moment thats not the time to be scrambling trying to make decision under pressure .
a rehearsed disaster recovery plan it can be the difference between a minor inconvenience and a businessending catastrophe .
solid advice .
now i have heard a lot about this threetwoone backup rule .
something tell me thats got to be part of this disaster recovery plan .
you are absolutely on the track .
the threetwoone rule it is the golden rule of data protection and for good reason .
all for those of u who might have missed that memo break down the threetwoone rule for u . picture this .
you have three copy of your data ?
your primary copy the one you are working on and two backup .
those two backup they should be stored on two different type of medium .
one on an external hard drive and the other maybe in the cloud ?
thats the two part of the rule .
and here come the one at least one of those backup .
probably the one on that external drive should be stored offline completely disconnected from your network .
even if hacker managed to breach your main system and your online backup that offline copy it is your trump card .
think of it a your data escape pod .
safely tucked away ready to bring thing back online if the unthinkable happens .
wow thats a comforting thought ive got to say .
this ha been incredibly insightful .
i think weve all learned a thing or two today about the importance of robust cybersecurity especially in light of this veeam vulnerability .
this incident it serf a a stark wake up call for everyone .
regardless of the size of your business the sensitivity of your data cybersecurity is not something you can afford to ignore .
and it is not a one time fix ?
it is an ongoing process of staying informed adapting to new threat and making sure your defense are up to par .
always be learning always be adapting and never underestimate the importance of a good backup and recovery plan .
on that note i think it is time for u to wrap up another deep dive .

the following is a conversation with stephen wolfram his third time on the podcast .
he a computer scientist mathematician theoretical physicist and the founder of wolfram research a company behind mathematica wolfram alpha wolfram language and the new wolfram physic project .
this conversation is a wild technical rollercoaster ride through topic of complexity mathematics physic computing and consciousness .
i think this is what this podcast is becoming a wild ride .
some episode are about physic some about robot some are about war and power some are about the human condition and our search for meaning and some are what the comedian tim dylan call fun .
this is the lex friedman podcast .
to support it please check out the sponsor in the description .
and now here my conversation with stephen wolfram .
almost twenty year ago you published the new science where you presented a study of complexity and an approach from modeling of complex system .
let u return again to the core idea of complexity .
what is complexity ?
i do not know i think thats not the most interesting question .
it is if you ask a biologist what is life ?
thats not the question they care the most about .
what i wa interested in is how doe something that we would usually identify a complexity arise in nature ?
i got interested in that question fifty year ago which is embarrassing a long time ago .
and i wa how doe snowflake get to have complicated form ?
how to galaxy get to have complicated shape ?
how doe how do living system get produced ?
thing that ?
and the question is whats the underlying scientific basis for those kind of thing ?
and the thing that i wa at first very surprised by because ive been doing physic some particle physic some fancy mathematical physic and on and it is i know all this fancy stuff .
i should be able to solve this basic science question .
and i couldnt .
this wa early maybe one thousand nine hundred and eightyish time frame .
and it is what can one do to understand the basic secret that nature seems to have ?
because seems nature you look around in the natural world it is full of incredibly complicated form .
you look at most engineered kind of thing for instance they tend to be we got circle and line and thing this .
and the question is what secret doe nature have that let it make all this complexity that we in doing engineering for example do not naturally seem to have ?
and that wa the the thing that i got interested in .
and then the question wa could i understand that with thing mathematical physic ?
then work very .
then i got to thinking about is there some other way to try to understand this ?
and then the question wa if you are going to look at some system in nature how do you make a model for that system for what that system doe ?
a model is some abstract representation of the system some formal representation of the system .
what is the raw material that you can make that model out of ?
and what i realized wa program are good source of raw material for making model of thing .
and in term of my personal history to me that seemed obvious .
and the notion of let try and make model by starting from computational primitive and seeing what we can build up .
that seemed a obvious thing to do .
in retrospect it might not have been externally quite obvious but it wa obvious to me at the time given the path that i happened to have been on .
that got me into this question of let use program to model what happens in nature .
and the question then is what program ?
and we are used to program that you write for some particular purpose and to be a long piece of code and it doe some specific thing .
but what i got interested in wa if you go out into the computational universal possible program you say take the simplest program you can imagine what doe it do ?
and i started studying these thing called cellular automaton .
i did not know it first .
they were called cellular automaton but i found that out subsequently but it is a line of cell each one is black or white .
and it is some rule that say the color of the cell is determined by the color that had on previous step and it is two neighbor on previous step .
and i had initially thought that sufficiently simple set up is not going to do anything interesting .
it is always going to be simple no complexity simple rule simple behavior .
but then i ran the computer experiment which is pretty easy to do .
probably took a few hour originally .
and the result were not what i expected at all .
now needle to say in the way that science work .
the result that i got a lot of unexpected thing which i thought were interesting but the strongest which wa already there in the printout i made .
i did not understand for a couple more year .
it wa not the compressed version of the story is you run the experiment and you immediately see whats going on but i wasnt smart enough to do that to speak .
but the big the big thing is even with very simple rule of that type the minimal tiniest program the one line program or something it is possible to get very complicated behavior .
my favorite example is the thing called rule thirty which is a particular cell error or tomaton rule you started off from one black cell and it make this complicated pattern .
and that for me wa a critical discovery that then said playing back on to how doe nature make complexity ?
i realized that might be how it doe it .
that might be the secret that it is using is that in this computational universe of possible program it is pretty easy to get program where even though the program is simple the behavior when you run the program is not simple at all .
and that wa for me that wa the the story of how that that wa the the indication that one had got an idea of what the secret that nature us to make complexity and that complexity how complexity can be made in other place .
now if you say what is complexity ?
it is complexity is it is not easy to tell whats going on .
thats the informal version of what is complexity .
but there is something going on .
but thats a rule .
what ? .
no the rule can generate randomness. . thats not obvious .
in other word thats not obvious at all. . and it wasnt what i expected .
it is not what people intuition had been and ha been for a long time .
that is why one might think you have a rule you can tell there a rule behind it .
it is the early robot and science fiction movie but you can tell it is a robot because it doe simple things. . turn out that is not the story .
but it is not obvious that is not the story because people assume simple rule simple behavior .
and that the the key discovery about the computational universe is that is not true .
and that discovery go very deep and relates to all kind of thing that ive spent year and year studying .
but in the end the the the what is complexity is you can not easily tell what it is going to do .
you could run the rule and see what happens .
but you can not say show me the rule .
i know whats going to happen .
and the key phenomenon around that is this thing i call computational irreducibility .
this fact that in something rule thirty you might say whats going to do after a million step ?
you can run it for a million step and do what it doe to find out .
but you can not compress that .
you can not reduce that and say i am going to be able to jump ahead and say this is what it is going to do after a million step .
but i do not have to go through anything that computational effort .
by the way ha anybody succeeded that ?
you had a challenge a competition. . for predicting the middle column of rule thirty and but eat anybody .
a number of people have sent thing in and people are picking away at it .
but it is hard .
it is it is ive been ive been even proving that the santa column of rule thirty doesnt repeat .
thats something i think might be doable. . mathematically proving .
and thats analogous to a similar thing the digit of pi which are also generated in this very deterministic way .
and a question is how random of the digit of pi ?
for example doe every first of all doe the digit of pi have a repeat ?
we know they do not because it wa proved in the 1800s that pi is not a rational number .
that mean only rational number have digit sequence that repeat .
we know the digit of pi do not repeat .
another question is doe one hundred and twenty three or whatever they are all the digit based tunnel based tool however you work it out to they all occur with equal frequency .
thats far away from what can be understood mathematically at this point .
and thats thats but i am i am even looking for step one which is prove that the santa column doesnt repeat .
and then prove other thing about it a redistribution of equal number of zero and 1 . and those are thing which i i set up a little little rise thing because i thought those were not not not too out of range .
those are thing which are within a modest amount of time it is conceivable that those could be done .
they are not they are not far away from what current mathematics might allow .
theyll require a bunch of cleverness and hopefully some interesting new idea that will be useful of place .
but you started in one thousand nine hundred and eighty with this idea before i think you realized this idea of program .
you start that there might be some thermodynamic randomness and then complexity come from a clever filter that you i do not know spaghetti or something .
you you you you filter the randomness and outcome complexity which is an interesting intuition .
how do we know thats not whats happening ?
because you were then able to develop look you do not need this incredible randomness you can have very simple predictable initial condition and predictable rule and that from that in my complexity still there might be some system where it is filtering randomness and the input .
the point is when you have quote randomness then the input that mean there all kind of information in the input .
and in a sense what you get out will be maybe something close to what you put in .
people are very in dynamical system theory bigger mathematics that developed from the early 1900s and got big in the 1980s an example of what people study there lot and it is popular version is chaos theory .
an example of what people study a lot is the shift map which is taking two x mod one two at the fractional part of two x which is taking digit and binary and shifting them to the left .
at every step you get to see if you say how big is this number that i got out ?
the most important digit in that number is whatever ended up at the left hand end .
but now if you start off from an arbitrary random number which is quote random we chosen all it digit around them then when you run that chaos theory shift map all that you get out is whatever you put in .
you get to see what you are what to it is not obvious that you would excavate all of those digit .
it is almost explaining if that phenomenon is an important thing .
it is telling you that the fluid dynamic which describes fluid a continuous medium and on is not .
a you do not have that issue you do not have to argue about wa that something complicated put in because plainly obviously there wasnt now .
a a practical matter in doing experiment the big thing is if the thing is complex and reproducible then it did not come from filtering some quote randomness from the outside world .
is it possible to for sure know that our universe doe not at the fundamental level have randomness ?
is it possible to conclusively say there no randomness at the bottom ?
it is an interesting question .
science natural science is an inductive business ?
you observe a bunch of thing and you say can we fit these together ?
what is our hypothesis for whats going on ?
the thing that i think i can say fairly definitively is at this point we understand enough about fundamental physic that there is if there wa an extra dice being thrown it is something that doesnt need to be there .
we can get what we see without that .
now could you add that in a an extra little featurewide without breaking the universe probably but in fact almost certainly yes but is it necessary for understanding the universe ?
no and i think from a more fundamental point of view it is it is i think i might be able to argue .
one of the thing that ive been interested in been pretty surprised that ive had anything sent in to say about is the question of why doe the universe exist ?
i did not think that wa a question that i would i thought that wa a far out there metaphysical thing even the philosopher have stayed away from that question for the most part .
it is such a difficult to address question but i think to my great surprise that from our physic project and on that it is possible to address that question and explain why the universe exists .
and i have a suspicion .
ive not thought it through .
i have a suspicion that that explanation will eventually show you that in no meaningful sense can there be randomness underneath the universe ?
that is that if there is it is something that is necessarily irrelevant to our perception of the universe .
that is that it could be there but doesnt matter because in a sense weve already whatever it would do whatever extra thing it would add is not relevant to our perception of whats going on .
why doe the universe exist ?
how doe the irrelevant randomness connect to the big why question of the universe ?
why doe the universe exist ?
let see and it is the only universe weve got .
it is the only one .
about that time pretty sure .
now maybe which one which of these topic is better to enter first ?
why doe the universe exist and why you think it is the only one that exists ?
and i think the let me let me describe a little bit about the white is the universe existence question .
the main issue is let say you have a model for the universe .
and you say ive got this this program or something and you run it and you make the universe .
now you say how do you act why is that program running ?
and people say youve got this program that make the universe what computer is it running on ?
what doe it mean ?
what actualizes something ?
two plus two equal four but thats different from saying there two a pile of two rock and another pile of two rock and many move them together and make four to speak .
and what is it that turn it from being this formal thing to being something that is actualized ? .
there we have to start thinking about what do we know about whats going on in the universe ?
we are observer of this universe but confusingly enough we are part of this universe .
in a sense we what what what if we say what do we what do we know about whats going on in the universe ?
what we know is what our consciousness record about whats going on in the universe ?
and consciousness is part of the fabric of the universe .
yes we are in it .
and maybe i should maybe i should start off by saying something about the consciousness story because thats some yes .
maybe we should begin even before that at the very base layer of the wolfram physic project maybe you can give a broad overview once again quick about this hypergraph model .
and also what is it a year and a half ago since youve brought this project to the world what is the status of date where what are all the beautiful idea you have come across ?
what are the interesting thing you can mention ?
i mentioned it is it is a it is a it is a freaking cambrian explosion .
it is it is crazy .
there are all these thing which ive wanted about for year .
and suddenly there way to think about them .
and i did not see the real strength of whats happened .
i absolutely did not see coming .
and the real strength of it is weve got this model for physic but it turn out it is a foundational model thats a different computation model that i am calling this multicomputational model .
and that that model is applicable not only to physic but also to lot of other kind of thing .
and one reason thats extremely powerful is because physic ha been very successful .
we know a lot based on what we figured out in physic .
and if we know that the same model governs physic and governs i do not know economics linguistics immunology whatever we know that the same model governs those thing .
we can start using thing that weve successfully discovered in physic and applying those intuition in all these other area .
and thats pretty exciting and very surprising to me .
and in fact it is in the original story of you go and you explain why is there complexity in the natural world then you realize there all this complexity there all this computational irreducibility .
there a lot we can not know about whats going to happen .
it is very confusing thing for people who say science ha nailed everything down .
we are going to based on science we can know everything .
there this computational irreducibility thing in the middle of that thrown up by science to speak .
and then the question is given computational irreducibility how can we figure out anything about what happens in the world ?
why are not we why are we able to predict anything ?
why are we able to operate in the world ?
and the answer is that we live in these slice of computational reeutability that exist in this ocean of computational irreducibility .
thats been an exciting thing but i would say that in general for our project it is been going spectacularly .
it is very honestly it wasnt something i expected to happen in my lifetime .
but i think that the thing that whats happened with the physic project it is a it can explain a little bit about how the model work but we can maybe ask you the following question .
it is easy through word describe how cellular atomic work youve explained this and it is the fundamental mechanism by which you in your book and you science explore the idea of complexity and how to do science in this world of reducible island and irreducible generally irreducibility .
how doe the model of hypographs differ from cellular atomic and how doe the idea of multicomputation differ ?
maybe thats a way to describe it .
and then all we know about these atom of space is how they relate to each other .
wed say these three atom of space are associated with each other in some relation .
you can think about that a what atom of space is friend with what other atom of space .
you can build this essentially friend network of the atom of space .
and the starting point about physic project is thats what our universe is .
it is a giant friend network of the atom of space .
and how can that possibly represent our universe ?
it is in something water their molecule bouncing around but on a large scale that that produce fluid flow and we have fluid vortex and we have all of these phenomenon that are the emergent phenomenon from that underlying collection of molecule bouncing around .
and by the way it is important that that collection of molecule bouncing around have this phenomenon of computational irreducibility .
thats what lead to the second law of thermodynamics among other thing .
and that lead to randomness of the underlying behavior which is what give you something which on a large scale seems it is a smooth continuous type of thing .
and first thing is space is made of something it is made of all these atom of space connected together in this network .
and then everything that we experience is feature of that structure of space .
and it give you some odd enough the vortex look an atom itself a basic element .
there the level of abstraction if you squint and blur thing out it look at every level of abstraction you can define what is a basic individual entity .
yes but in this model there a bottom level .
there an elementary link maybe it is a minus one hundred ten to the minus one hundred meter let say which is small proton is ten to the minus fifteen meter .
the smallest weve ever been able to see with a particle accelerator a a random ten to the minus twenty one meter .
if we do not know precisely what the correct scale is but it is perhaps over the order of ten to the minus one hundred meter .
it is pretty small .
and but thats thats the end thats thats what thing are made of .
whats your intuition or where the ten to the minus one hundred come from ?
whats your intuition about this scale ?
there a calculation which i consider to be somewhat rickety which ha to do with comparing there are various fundamental constant .
there a speed of light .
the speed of light once the elementary time the speed of light is tell you the conversion from the elementary time to the elementary length .
then there the question of how do you convert to the elementary energy and how do you convert to between other thing .
and there a constant we know the speed of light we know the gravitational constant we know planck constant and quantum mechanic .
those are the three important one .
and we know some other thing we know thing the size of the universe the hubble constant thing that .
turn out in our model there is an additional parameter which is essentially the number of simultaneous thread of execution of the universe which is essentially the number of independent quantum process that are going on .
and that number let see if i remember that number that number is ten to the one hundred and seventy i think and it is a big number .
but that number then connects modifies what you might think from all these planck unit to give you the thing we are giving .
and there been a mystery and there more technical physic thing that the planck mass the planck energy planck energy is surprisingly big .
the planck length is tiny ten to the minus thirty four meter that planck time ten to the minus forty three meter i think for second i think .
but the planck energy is the energy of a lightning strike which is pretty weird .
and our model the actual elementary energy is that divided by the number of simultaneous quantum thread and it end up being small too .
and that explains that mystery thats been around for a while about how planck unit work .
but whether that precise estimate is we do not know yet .
thats one of the thing that been a thing weve been pretty interested in is how do through how do you make a gravitational microscope that can see through to the atom of space ?
how do you get an influx flow for example if you go to hypersonic flow or something youve got a mark twenty space plane or something it matter that they are individual molecule hitting the space plane not a continuous food .
the question is what is the analogous what is the analog of hypersonic flow for our first thing about the structure of space time ?
and it look a rapidly rotating black hole at the critical rotation rate .
it look a if thats a case where essentially the structure of space time is about to fall apart .
we do not know that yet .
you maybe elaborate a little bit deeper how a microscope they can see to tend to the minus one hundred how rotating black hole and presumably the detailed accurate detection of gravitational wave from such black hole can reveal the discrepaness of space .
first thing is what is a black hole ?
we need to go a little bit further in the story of whats based time is because i explained a little bit about what space is but it did not talk about what time is and thats important in understanding space time .
it is been and your sense is both space and time in this story or discreet .
absolutely but it is a complicated story .
and needle to say .
it is important at the bottom it is very simple at the bottom .
it is very in the end it is simple but deeply abstract .
and and something that is simple in conception but wrapping one head around whats going on is pretty hard .
it is it is some and we are saying and thats the relation between atom of space are the hyper edge of the hypograph .
and we got some big collection of these atom of space maybe ten to the four hundred or something in our in our universe .
and thats the structure of space thats an every feature of what we experience in the world is a feature of that that hypograph thats spatial hypograph .
then the question is how doe what doe that special hypograph do ?
the idea is that there are rule that update thats spatial hypograph .
and in a cellular automaton youve got this line of cell and you say it every step and every time step youve got fixed time step fixed array of cell at every step every cell get updated according to a certain rule .
and thats the thats the way it work .
now in this hypograph it is vaguely the same thing .
we say every time a little piece of hypograph that look this update it to one that look this .
it is keep rewriting this hypograph .
every time something look that anywhere in the universe it get rewritten .
now one thing thats tricky about that which will come to is this multicomputational idea which ha to do with you are not saying in some lockstep way do this one then this one then this one .
it is whenever one you can do you can go ahead and do it .
and that lead one not to have a single thread of time in the universe .
because if you knew which one to do you would say do this one then we do this one then we do this one .
but if you say do whichever one you feel you end up with these multiple thread of time .
it is multiple history of the universe depending on which order you happen to do the thing you could do in .
it is fundamentally a synchronous and parallel .
yes which is very uncomfortable for the human brain that seek for thing to be sequential .
and synchronous. . i think that this is part of the story of consciousness is i think the key aspect of consciousness that is important for parsing the universe is this point that we have a single thread of experience .
we have a memory of what happened in the past .
we can say something predict something about the future but there a single thread of experience .
and it is not obvious it should work that way .
weve got one hundred billion neuron in our brain and they are all firing in all kind of different way .
but yet our experience is that there is the single thread of time that go along .
and the fact to go on with the basic setup it is we got this spatial hypergraph it is got all these atom of space .
they are getting they are getting these little clump of atom of space they are getting turned into other clump of atom of space .
and thats happening everywhere in the universe all the time .
and one thing it is a little bit weird it is there nothing permanent in the universe .
the universe is getting rewritten everywhere all the time .
and if it wasnt getting rewritten it would space wouldnt be knitted together .
that is space would fall apart .
there wouldnt be any way in which we could say this part of space is next to this part of space .
one of the thing that i wa people were confused about back in antiquity ancient greek philosopher and on is how doe motion work ?
how can it be the case that you can take a thing that we can walk around ?
and it is still u when we walked a foot forward to speak .
and in a sense with our model thats again a question because it is a different set of atom of space when we when i move my hand it is moving into a different set of atom of space .
it is having to be recreated it is not the thing itself is not there it is being continuously recreated all the time .
now it is a little bit wave in an ocean vortex and fluid which again the actual molecule that exist in those are not what define the identity of the thing .
and but it is a little bit this idea that there can be pure motion that it is even possible for an object to move around in the universe and not change is it is not selfevident that such a thing should be possible .
and that is part of our perception of the universe is that we we parse those aspect to the universe where thing pure motion are possible .
now pure motion even in general it is a bit of a complicated thing .
if you imagine your average teacup or something approaching a black hole it is deformed and distorted by the structure of space time .
and to say is it pure motion ?
is it that same teacup thats the same shape ?
it is a bit of a complicated story .
and this is a more extreme version of that .
anyway the thing thats happening is weve got space weve got this notion of time .
time is this this rewriting of the hypergraph .
and one of the thing thats important about that time is this computational irreducible process .
there something time is not something where it is the mathematical view of time tends to be time is to coordinate .
we can slide a slider turn a knob and well change the time that weve got in this equation .
but in this picture of time thats not how it work at all .
time is this inexorable irreducible set of computation that go on that go from where we are now to the future .
and space and time they are all these folk story you can tell about why space and time is the same thing .
in this model they are fundamentally not the same thing .
space is this connection between these atom of space time is this computational process .
the thing that the first surprising thing is it turn out you get relativity anyway .
and in the end the only thing you can tell is what are the causal relationship between event .
an event in this an elementary event is a little piece of hypergraph got rewritten .
and that mean a few hyper edge of the hypergraph were consumed by the event and you produce some other hyper edge .
and thats an elementary event .
and then the question is what we can tell is what the network of causal relationship between elementary event thats the ultimate thing with causal graph of the universe .
and it turn out that there this property of causal invariance that is true of a bunch of these model .
and i think is inevitably true for a variety of reason that make it be the case that it doesnt matter if you are saying ive got this hypergraph and i can rewrite this piece here and this piece here and i do the more and different order .
when you construct the causal graph for each of those order that you choose to do thing in youll end up with the same causal graph .
and thats essentially why thats in the end why rotivity work .
it is why our perception of space and time is a a having this connection that rotivity say they should have .
and thats thats how that work .
i think i am missing a little piece .
if you can go there again you said the fact that the observer is embedded in this hypergraph whats missing ?
what is the observer not able to stay above this universe space ?
the only thing they know is the set of causal relationship .
let imagine that the universe is a touring machine .
touring machine have this one update head which doe something and otherwise a term machine doe nothing .
and the term machine work by having this head move around and do it is updating where the head happens to be .
the question is could the universe be a touring machine ?
could the universe have a single updating head thats zipping around all over the place ?
you say thats crazy because i am talking to you you seem to be updating i am updating etc .
but the thing is there no way to know that because if there wa this head moving around it is it update me but you are completely frozen at that point .
until the head ha come over and updated you you have no idea what happened to me .
and if you unravel that argument you realize the only thing we can tell is what the network of causal relationship between the thing that happened were .
we do not get to know from some outside god eye view of the thing .
we do not get to know what from the outside what happened .
we only get to know what the set of relationship between the thing that happened we have .
but if i somehow record a trace of this i guess we would be called multicomputation can not i then look back in the thought of the trace ?
some you place throughout the universe throughout a log that record in my own pocket of in this hypergraph can not i realizing that i am getting an outdated picture ?
see the problem is that this is where thing start getting very entangled in term of what one understands .
the problem is that any such recording device is itself part of the universe .
you do not get to say you never get to say let go outside the universe and go do this .
and thats why lot of the feature of this model and the way thing work end up being a result of that .
what i guess from an human level what is the cost you are paying ?
what are you missing from not getting an updated picture all the time ?
i understand what you said .
but how doe consciousness emerge from that ?
how what are the limitation of that observer ?
i understand you are getting a deli thats thats there a bunch of limitation of the observer i think .
maybe explain something about quantum mechanic because that maybe is an extreme version of some of these issue which help to motivate why one should think thing through a little bit more carefully .
one feature of this in standard physic high school physic you learn they quagged the emotion for a ball and the it say you are through the ball the angle this velocity thing will move in this way and there a definite answer. ?
the key story of quantum mechanic is there are not definite answer to where doe the ball go ?
there this whole bundle of possible path and all we say we know from quantum mechanic is certain probability for where the ball will end up .
thats the core idea of quantum mechanic .
in our model quantum mechanic is not some plugin addon type thing .
you absolutely can not get away from quantum mechanic because a you think about updating this hypergraph there is not one sequence of thing one definite sequence of thing that can happen .
there are all these different possible update sequence that can occur .
you could do this piece of the hypergraph now and then this one later etc etc etc .
all those different part of history correspond to these quantum quantum part in quantum mechanic .
these different possible quantum history .
i wanted the thing thats surprising about it is they they branch there can be a certain state of the universe and it could do this or it could do that but they can also merge .
they can be two state of the universe which they are next state .
the next state they produce is the same for both of them .
and that process of branching and merging is critical and the idea that they can be merging is critical and somewhat nontrivial for these hypergraphs because there a whole graph i see morphism story and there a whole very elaborate set of map where that is .
thats where the causal invariance come in .
yes thats but then what happens is that what what one seeing weve got this thing it is branching it is merging etc etc etc .
now the question is how do we perceive that ?
how do we why do not we notice that the universe is branching and merging ?
why why is it the case that we think a definite set of thing happen ?
the answer is we are embedded in that universe and our brain are branching and merging too .
and what quantum mechanic becomes a story of is how doe a branching brain perceive a branching universe ?
and the key thing is a soon a you say i think definite thing happen in the universe .
that mean you are essentially conflating lot of different part of history .
you are saying a far a i am concerned because i am convinced that definite thing happen in the universe all these part of history must be equivalent .
now it is not obvious that that would be a consistent thing to do .
it might be you say all these part of history equivalent but by golly moment later that would be a completely inconsistent point of view .
everything would have gone to hell in different way .
the fact that that doesnt happen is thats a consequence of this causal invariance thing but thats and the fact that that doe happen a little bit is what cause little quantum effect .
and if that did not happen at all there wouldnt be anything that is quantum mechanic .
it would be quantum mechanic is in this in this this bundle of path it is a little bit what happens in statistical mechanic and fluid mechanic whatever that most of the time you see this continuous fluid .
you see the world progressing in this way thats this continuous fluid .
but every often if you look at the exact itspirament you can start seeing it is made of these molecule where they might go that way or they might go this way and thats quantum effect .
and thats this idea of where we are embedded in the universe this branching brain is perceiving this branching universe and that end up being a story of quantum mechanic .
thats part of the whole picture of whats going on .
but i think to come back to where this consciousness what is the story of consciousness ?
in the universe weve got whatever it is ten to the four hundred atom of space they are all doing these complicated thing .
it is all a big complicated irreducible computation .
the question is what do we perceive from all of that ?
and the answer is that we are parsing the universe in a particular way .
let me again go back to the gas molecule analogy .
in the gas in this room there are molecule bouncing around all kind of complicated pattern .
but we do not care .
all we notice is there the gas law are satisfied .
maybe there some fluid dynamic these are feature of that assembly molecule that we notice .
and then lot of detail we do not notice .
when you say we do mean the tool of physic it do mean are the human brain and it perception system .
the human brain is where it start but we built a bunch of instrument to do a bit better than the human brain .
but they still have many of the same kind of idea their camera and their pressure sensor and their these kind of thing .
they are not at this point we do not know how to make fundamentally qualitatively different sensory devices. . and it is always an extension of the conscious experience of the sensory experience .
what are sensory experience ?
and sensory experience that somehow intricately tied to consciousness. . one question is when we are looking at all these molecule in the gas and they might be ten to twenty it molecule and some little box or something it is what do we notice about those molecule ?
one thing that we can say is we do not notice that much .
we are we are computationally bounded observer .
we can not go in and say i am the ten of the twenty molecule and i know that i can decrypt emotion and i can figure out this and that .
it is i am going to say whats the average density molecule .
and one key feature of u is that we are computationally bounded .
and that when you are looking at a universe which is full of computation and doing huge amount of computation but we are computationally bounded there only certain thing about that universe that we are going to be sensitive to .
we are not going to be figuring out what all the atom are space are doing because we are computationally bounded observer and we are only sampling these small set of feature .
i think the two defining feature of consciousness that and i would say that the preamble to this is for year because ive talked about computation and fundamental feature of physic and science people ask me what about consciousness ?
and i for year ive said i have nothing to say about consciousness .
and ive told the story you talk about intelligence you talk about life .
these are both feature where you say whats the abstract definition of life ?
we do not know the abstract definition .
we know the one for life on earth .
it is got rna it is got cell membrane it is got all this stuff .
similarly for intelligence we know the human definition of intelligence but what is intelligence abstract ?
and what ive long believed is that the abstract definition of intelligence is computational sophistication .
that is that a soon a you can be computational it is sophisticated thats the abstract version that generalized version of intelligence .
then the question is what about consciousness ?
and what i realized is that consciousness is a step down from intelligence .
that is that you might think consciousness is the top of the pile but i do not think it is .
i think that there this notion of computational sophistication which is the generalized intelligence but consciousness ha two limitation i think .
one of them is computational boundedness .
that is that we are only perceiving a computationally bounded view of the universe .
and the other is this idea of a single thread of time .
that is that we and in fact we know neurophysiologically our brain go to some trouble to give u this one thread of attention to speak .
and it is not the case that in all the neuron and our brain that that at least in our conscious note the the corresponds to language and our conscious experience we have the single thread of attention single thread of perception .
and maybe there something unconscious thats bubbling around thats the almost the quantum version of whats happening in our brain .
to speak weve got the the classical flow of what we are mostly thinking about to speak but there this bubbling around of other pod that is all those other neuron that did not make it to be part of our conscious stream of experience .
in that sense intelligence a computational sophistication is much broader than the the computational constraint which conscious and separate under and also the sequential thing .
the notion of time thats thats interesting but then the the the follow of question is starting to get a sense of what is intelligence .
now how doe that connect our human brick ?
is you are saying intelligence is almost a fabric what we plug into it or something yeah i think people consciousness plug into it .
yeah the intelligence i think the core intelligence some level a word but we are asking what is the the notion of intelligence a we generalize it beyond the bound of human beyond the bound of even the ai that we human have built and on .
what what is intelligence is the weather people say the weather ha a mind of it own .
what doe that mean ?
can the weather be intelligent ?
what doe agency have to do with intelligence here ?
is intelligence your conception of computation ?
intelligence is the is the capacity to perform computation and see i think .
i think thats and i think that this question of of is it for a purpose that quickly degenerate into a horrible philosophical mess because whenever you say did the weather do that for a purpose ?
it wa trying to move a bunch of hot air from the quater to the pole or something .
thats it purpose .
but why because it seemed to be equally a dumb today a i wa yesterday .
there some persistence or a consistency over time that the intelligence i plugged into .
whats it seems there a hard constraint but the team amount of computation i can perform in my consciousness .
they seem to you close to connected somehow .
i think the point is that the thing that give you the ability to have conscious intelligence you can have this .
one thing is we do not know intelligence is other than the one that are very much u . yes. . and one that are very much u i think have this feature of single threat of time bounded computationally bounded .
now that but you also need computational sophistication having a single threat of time and being computational bounded you could be a clock going ticktock that would satisfy those condition .
but the fact that we have this irreducible computational ability thats thats an important feature .
thats thats the the the the bedrock on which we can construct the thing we construct .
in other word if we say why do we believe that there is a continuous space let say why do we believe that gravity work the way it doe ?
in principle we could be parsing detail of the universe that were that involve the analogy is again with statistical mechanic and molecule and a box .
we could be sensitive to every detail of the swirling around with these molecule and we could say what matter is the the wiggle effect .
that is there something that we human never notice because in some weird thing that happens when there are fifteen collision of air molecule and this happens and that happens .
we see the pure motion of a ball .
i am moving about. . and why do we see that ? .
what seems to be the case is that a soon a we assume computational boundedness single thread of time that lead u to general to it .
in other word we can not avoid that .
thats the way that we we will parse the universe given those constraint .
we parse the universe according to those particular in such a way that we say the aggregate reducible pocket of computational reducible let say that we slice out of this whole computational reducible ocean of behavior is this one that corresponds to general activity .
but we do not perceive general relativity .
we do if we do fancy experiment .
you are saying perceived doe mean the full of something .
thats a great example of general activity in action .
thats not what the difference is in that in newtonian mechanic .
this is when i say general relativity thats gravity .
the uber theory to speak .
newtonian gravity is the approximation that we can make on the earth and thing that .
this is the phenomenon of gravity is one that is a consequence of we would perceive something very different from gravity .
the way to understand that is when we think about we make up reference frame with which we parse whats happening in space and time .
in other word one of the one of the thing that we do is we say a time progress everywhere in space is something happens at a particular time and then we go to the next time .
and we say this is what space at the next time this is what space at the next time .
thats it is the reason we are used to doing that is because when we look around we might see ten hundred meter away .
the time it take light to travel that distance is short compared to the time it take our brain to know what happened .
a far a our brain are concerned we are parsing the universe in this there is a moment in time it is all of space there a moment in time it is all of space .
if we were the size of planet something we would have a different perception because the speed of light would be much more important to u . we wouldnt have this perception that thing happen progressively in time everywhere in space .
and thats an important constraint .
and the reason that we parse the universe in the way that cause u to say gravity work the way it doe is because we are doing thing deciding that we can say the universe exists space ha a definite structure .
there is a moment in time space ha this definite structure .
we moved to the next moment in time space .
another structure that set up is what let u deduce what past the universe in such a way that we say gravity work the way it doe .
that reference frame that the illusion of that is that you are saying that somehow useful for consciousness .
thats what consciousness doe because in a sense what consciousness is doing is there are it is insisting that the universe is sequentialized .
that is and it is not allowing the possibility that there are these multiple thread of time and they are all flowing differently .
it is saying no everything is happening in this one thread of experience that we have .
and that illusion of that one thread of experience can not happen at the planetary scale .
here are you saying typical human ?
are you saying we are at a human level a special here for consciousness ?
for our consciousness it is if we existed at a scale close to the elementary length for example then our perception of the universe will be absurdly different .
but this make it consciousness seem a weird side effect of this particular scale .
and who care ?
the consciousness is not that special .
i think look i think that a very interesting question is which ive said in a little bit about is what can you imagine ?
what is a factoring of something what are some other possible way you could exist to speak and if you were a photon if you were some thing that wa some intelligence represented in term of photon .
for example the photon we receive in the cosmic microwave background those photon a far a they are concerned the universe started .
they were emitted one hundredzero year off of the beginning of the universe theyve been traveling at the speed of light time stayed still for them and then they arrived and we detected them .
for them the universe started and thats a different perception of that ha implication for a very different perception of time .
they do not have their single thread it seems to be important for being able to tell a heck of a good story .
we human tell story .
we can tell u story .
we can tell u story .
we can tell u story .
what other kind of story can you tell ?
photon are boring story .
yeah thats it .
can you can you maybe elaborate how the principle of computational equivalence can save a planet ?
that would that would be a a terrible spoiler for me .
there would be a spoiler yeah but but no but i let me say what the principle of computational equivalence is .
the question is you are you have a system you have some rule you can think of it behavior a corresponding to a computation .
the question is how sophisticated is that computation ?
we are both running computation that are the same law the same level of computation to speak .
you can you can use natural computation to compute thing to speak .
you can use nature to compute you do not need to have done all that engineering and it is the it is it is feel a little disappointing that you say we are going to build all these server .
we are going to do all these thing .
we are going to make maybe we are going to have human consciousness uploaded into some elaborate digital environment and then you look at that thing and you say it is got electron moving around in a rock and then you say whats the difference ?
and the principle of computational equivalence say there is not at some level a fundamental you can not say mathematically there a fundamental difference between the rock that is the future of human consciousness and the rock thats a rock .
if only we could parse the universe in the way immediately this amazing thing thats going on in this huge culture thats developed and all that thing would be obvious to u but it is not because we have a particular way of parsing the universe .
would that thing also have a agency i do not know the word to use but something consciousness but a different consciousness ?
i suspect that any of these thing would also have an intrinsic feeling about themselves .
ive been trying to think recently about constructing an experiment about what if you would a piece of a cellular automaton thats what would you are feeling about your self be ?
and can we put ourselves in the shoe and the cell of the cellular automaton to speak ?
can we can we get ourselves close enough to that that we could have a sense of what the world would be if you were operating in that way ?
see the main issue is this .
where it is a philosophical difficult thing because it is we do what we do .
we understand ourselves at least to some extent .
thats correct .
and but yet what are we trying to do for example when we are trying to make a model of physic ?
what are we trying to do ?
because you say can we work out what the universe doe ?
of course we can we watch the universe the universe doe what it doe .
but what we are trying to do when we make a model of physic is we are trying to get to the point where we can tell a story to ourselves that we understand that is also a representation of what the universe doe .
it is this can we make a bridge between what we human can understand in our mind and what the universe doe .
and in a sense a large part of my life effort have been devoted to making computational language which is a bridge between what is possible in the computational universe and what we human can conceptualize and think about .
and in a sense when you add physic you are adding this other piece where we can mediated by computer can we get physic to the point where we human can understand something about whats happening in it .
and when we talk about an alien intelligence it is the same story .
it is is there a way of mapping whats happening there onto something that we human can understand ?
and physic in some sense is our exhibit one of the story of alien intelligence .
and what we are doing in making a model of physic is mapping that onto something that we understand .
when you are talking about to backtrack a little bit about cellular atomic being able to whats it to be a cellular atomic in the way thats equivalent to what it is to be a conscious human being ?
how do you approach that ?
and the question is how do you get inside it ?
it is when we with human ?
it is we can not get inside each others consciousness .
it is there is an experience that somebody is having but you can perceive thing from the outside but getting inside it .
and i for me these thought ill go to susan this one i have not untangled .
yeah but there may be a way to map the program to your conscious experience .
for example when you play a video game you do a first person shooter .
you walk around inside this entity .
it is very different thing that i am watching in this entity .
if you can somehow connect more and more connect this this full conscious experience to this subset of the cellular automaton .
yeah it is something that .
but the difference in the first person shooter thing is they are still your brain and your memory is still remembering you you still have it is it is hard to again what one going to get ?
one is not going to be able to be the cellular automaton .
one going to be able to watch what the cellular automaton doe .
but this is the frustrating thing that i am trying to understand how to how to think about being it to speak. . in virtual reality there a concept of immersion what anything with video game with book there a concept of immersion .
it feel over time if the virtual reality experience is a done and maybe in the future will be extremely done the immersion lead you to feel you mentioned memory you forget that you even ever existed outside that experience .
you could argue mathematically that you can never truly become a mar book .
yeah why can not you merge with the cellular automaton ?
yeah but you are you are you are you are yeah you are part of the same fabric .
why can not you thats a good question .
let imagine the following scenario .
whats thats but then can you return back ?
it is let imagine youve uploaded your brain is scanned .
youve got every synapse mapped out .
you upload everything about you the brain simulator .
you upload the brain simulator and the brain simulator is some glorified cellular automaton .
and then you say now weve got an answer to what doe it feel to be a cellular automaton ?
it feel it felt to be ordinary you because they are both computational system and they are both operating in the same way .
in a sense but i think there there somehow more to it because in in that sense when you are making a brain simulator it is we are saying there another version of our consciousness .
the question that we are asking is if we tease away from our consciousness and get to something that is different how do we make a bridge to understanding whats going on there ?
and there a way of thinking about this this is coming on to question about the existence of the universe and on .
but one of the thing is there this notion that we have of rural space .
we have this idea of this physical space which is something you can move around in thats associated with that show the extent of the spatial hypergraph then there what we call branchial space the space of quantum branch .
in this in this thing we call the multiway graph of all of this branching history there this idea of a space where instead of moving around in physical space you are moving from history to history to speak from one possible history to another possible history .
and thats a different space that is the space in which quantum mechanic play out .
quantum mechanic for example something i think we are slowly understanding thing destructive interference in quantum mechanic .
the whats happening is branchial space is associated with phase in quantum mechanic .
and whats happening is the two photon that are supposed to be interfering and destructively interfering a winding up at different end of branchial space .
and u a these poor observer that are trying to that have branching brain that are trying to conflate together these different thread of history and say weve got a consistent story that we are telling here .
we are knitting together these thread of history .
by the time the two photon wound up at opposite end of branchial space we can not knit them together to tell a consistent story .
for u thats the analog of destructive interference .
and then there a space too which is the space of rule .
thats another level up .
there the question i do want to mention one thing because it is something ive realized in recent time and it is i think it is cool which is about time dilation and relativity .
and it help to understand something that help in understanding whats going on .
and in other word it is the twin who go off to alpha centauri and go very fast will age much le than the twin who on earth that is hanging out where they are hanging out .
why doe that happen ?
it ha to do with what motion is .
in in our model of physic what is motion ?
when you move from somewhere to somewhere it is you are having to recreate yourself at a different place in space .
when you exist at a particular place and you are evolve with time you are again you are updating yourself you are you are following these rule to update what happens .
and you do not have a much computation left over to work out what happens progressively with time .
and thats thats why time dilation happens .
and you can you can start it is interesting that one can get an intuition about something that because it ha seemed a mathematical fact about the mathematics of special relativity and on .
for me it is a little bit confusing what the you in that picture is because you are using up computation .
with simply saying the entity is updating itself according to the way that the universe update itself .
and the question is your those update thats imagine the you a a clock ?
but but then the alternative is that situation one where the thing is at rest situation two where it is moving the whats happening is it is having to recreate itself at every at every moment .
the thing is going to have to do the computation to be able to recreate itself at a different position in space .
and thats the intuition behind .
it is either going to spend it computation recreating itself at a different position in space or it is going to spend it computation doing the doing the updating of the of the ticking of the clock to speak .
the more updating is doing the le the ticking of the clock update is doing .
the more it hasnt to update because of motion yeah the le it can update the clock .
but the the thing about this physical space and physical space the main big theory is general relativity the theory of gravity and that tell you how thing move in physical space .
in branching space the big theory is the feynman path and the girl which it turn out tell you essentially how thing move in quantum in the space of quantum phase .
it is motion and branching space .
and it is a fun thing to start thinking about what all these thing that we know in physical space eventorizing and black hole and on .
what are the analogous thing in branching space ?
for example the speed of light whats the analog of the speed of light in branching space ?
it is the maximum speed of quantum entanglement .
the speed of light is a flash bulb go off here .
whats the maximum rate at which the effect of that flash bulb is detectable moving away in space ?
similarly in branching space something happens and the question is how far in this branching space in the space of quantum state how far away can that get within a certain period of time ?
and there this notion of a maximum entanglement speed and that might be observable .
thats the thing weve been poking at is might there be a way to observe it even in some atomic physic situation .
because one of the thing thats weird in quantum mechanic is when we study quantum mechanic we mostly study it in term of small number of particle .
this electron doe this this thing on an ion trap doe that and on .
but what we do with large number of particle all bet are off .
it is too complicated deal with quantum mechanic .
it is there two carbon atom there this molecule and we do a reaction and we draw a diagram and we say this carbon atom end up in this place and it is but wait a minute in quantum mechanic nothing end up in a definite place .
there always some wave function for this to happen .
how can it be the case that we can draw these reasonable it ended up in this place ?
and you have to say the environment of the molecule effectively made a bunch of measurement on the molecule to keep it classical .
and thats a story that ha to do with this whole thing about about measurement have to do with this idea of can we conclude that something definite happened ?
because in quantum mechanic the intrinsic quantum mechanic the mathematics of quantum mechanic is all about they are these amplitude for different thing to happen .
then there this thing of and then we make a measurement and we conclude that something definite happened .
and that ha to do with this thing i think about moving about knitting together these different thread of history and saying this is now something where we can definitively say something definite happened .
in the traditional theory of quantum mechanic it is after youve done all the sample sheet computation then this big hammer come down and you do a measurement and it is all over .
and it look you can do a lot because youve got all these different thread going on .
having this branchial space and this hypergraph model of physic do you think it is possible to then make prediction that are definite about a many body quantum mechanical system ?
i think it is likely yes .
yeah it get complicated .
and this thing about getting it to a definite a definite prediction about definite thing you can say about chemistry or something this thats a lot of work .
there a thing called the quantum xenoe effect .
the idea is quantum stuff happens but then if you make a measurement you are freezing time in quantum mechanic .
and it look there a possibility that with the relationship between the quantum xenoe effect and the way that many body quantum mechanic work and on maybe conceivably it may be possible to figure out a way to measure the maximum entanglement speed .
and the reason we can potentially do that is because the system we deal with in term of atom and thing they are pretty big a mole of atom is it is a lot of atom .
and but it is not a very it is something where to get when we are dealing with how can ten to the minus one hundred to speak ?
by the time youve got ten to the thirty of atom you are not you are within a little bit closer striking distance of that .
it is not weve got two atom and we are trying to see down to ten to the minus one hundred meter or whatever .
i do not know how it will work but this is a this is a potential direction .
and if you can tell by the way if we could measure the maximum entanglement speed we would know the elementary length .
these are all related .
if we get that one number we need one number .
if we can get that one number we can the theory ha no parameter anymore .
and there are other place there another another hope for doing that is in cosmology .
in this model one of the feature is the universe is not fixed to mention .
we think we love and three dimensional space but this hypergraph doesnt have any particular dimension .
it can emerge a something which i am an approximation .
it is a if you say whats the volume of a sphere in the hypergraph where a sphere is defined a how many node do you get to when you go a distance r away from a given point ?
and one of the thing we suspect is that the very early universe wa essentially infinite dimensional and that a the universe expanded it became lower dimensional .
and one of the thing that is another little point where we think there might be a way to measure some thing a dimension fluctuation in the early universe .
that is is there a is there leftover dimension fluctuation of at the time of the cosmic micro background one hundredzero year or something after the beginning of the universe ?
is it still the case that there were piece of the universe that did not have dimension three that had dimension three.one or something ?
and can we tell that ?
is that pathology observed fluctuation in dimension ?
i do not even know what that entail .
the question which should be an elementary exercise in lecture dynamic except it is not is understanding what happens to a photon when it propagates through three.one dimensional space ?
for example the inverse square law is a consequence of the the the surface area of a sphere is proportional to r squared .
but if you are not in three dimensional space the surface area of sphere is not proportional to r squared it is r to the whatever at two.one or something .
and that mean that i think when you dry and do optic a common principle in optic is hygons principle which say that every piece of a wave front of a of a of light is a source of new spherical wave .
and those spherical wave if they are different dimensional spherical wave will have other characteristic .
and there will be bizarre optical phenomenon which we havent figured out yet .
you are you are what looking for some weird photon trajectory that designate that it is three.one dimensional space ?
yeah yeah that would be an example of there are only a certain number of thing we can measure about photon .
we can measure the polarization we can measure the frequency we can measure the direction those kind of thing .
and how that all work out .
and in the current model of physic it is been hard to explain how the universe manages to be a uniform a it is .
in our model this turn out to be much more natural because the universe start very connected .
the hypergraph is not such that the ball that you grow starting from a single point ha volume are cubed .
it might have volume out of the five hundred or out of the infinity .
and that mean that you naturally get this much higher degree of connectivity and uniformity in the universe .
we would to do the same thing including dimension change .
this is difficult mathematical physic .
the reason it is difficult is the fundamental reason it is difficult .
when people invented calculus three hundred year ago calculus wa a story of understanding change and change a a function of a variable .
you can not apply the tool of calculus and naturally and easily to fractional dimension .
no and somebody ha to figure out how to do that .
we are trying to figure this out .
it is very interesting .
it is very connected to very frontier astute mathematics .
it is very beautiful .
but is it possible is it possible we are dealing with scale thats much smaller than our human scale is it possible to make prediction versus explanation ?
do you have a hope that this hypergraph model youll be able to make prediction ?
that then could be validated with a physic experiment prediction that could have been done or werent done otherwise .
yeah i think which in which domain do you think ?
they are going to be cosmology one to do with dimension fluctuation and thats a very bizarre effect .
nobody dimension fluctuation is something nobody ever looked for that .
if anybody see dimension fluctuation thats a huge flag that thats something our model is going on .
and how one detects that thats a problem of thats a problem of traditional physic in a sense of whats the best way to figure that out ?
and for example thats one there are all kind of thing one could imagine .
there are thing that in black hole merger it is possible that there will be effect of maximum entanglement speed in large black hole merger .
thats another possible thing .
and all of that is detected through what do you have a hope for ligo type of situation thats gravitational wave ?
yeah or alternatively i think it is look figuring out experiment is figuring out technology inventions. . that is youve got to set a raw material youve got an underlying model .
and now youve got to be very clever to figure out what is that thing i can measure that somehow leverage into the place .
and weve spent le effort on that than i would have liked because one of the one of the reason is that that i think that the the physicist whove been working on our model and weve now lot of physicist it is very very nice .
it is one of these case where i am almost i am pleasantly surprised that the absorption of the thing weve done ha been quite rapid and quite very positive .
it is a campground explosion of physicist too and i they do .
yes a lot of whats happened thats interesting and again not what i expected is .
they are mathematical structure .
and i think whats happened is our model provide a machine code that life underneath those model .
a typical example this is a due to jonathan gorard who one of the key people who been working on our project .
this is ill give you an example to give a sense of how these thing connect .
there in causal set theory .
the idea of causal set theory is there are in space time .
we imagine that there space and time .
it is the three plus one dimensional set up .
we imagine that there are event that happen at different time and place in space and time .
and the idea of causal set theory is the only thing you say about the universe is there are a bunch of event that happen randomly at different place in space and time .
and then the whole theory of physic ha to be to do with this graph of causal relationship between these randomly thrown down event .
theyve always been confused by the fact that to get even the rensen variant even relativeistic invariant you need a very special way to throw down those event .
and theyve had no natural way to understand how that would happen .
what jonathan figured out is that in fact from our model they instead of generating event at random our model necessarily generate event in some pattern in space time effectively that then lead to rensen variant and relativeistic invariant and all those kind of thing .
it is a place where all the mathematics thats been done on we have a random collection of event .
now what consequence doe that have in term of causal set theory and on that can all be wheeled in now that we have some different underlying foundational idea for what the particular distribution of event is a opposed to what we throw down random event .
and thats a typical example of what we are seeing in all these different area of how you can take interesting thing that have been done in mathematical physic and connect them .
and it is beautiful because the abstract model we have seem to plug into all these different very interesting very elegant abstract idea .
but we are now giving a reason for that to be the way for a reason for one to care .
it is saying you can think about computation abstractly .
you can think about i do not know combinators or something a abstract computational thing .
and you can do all kind of study of them but it is why do we care ?
turn machine are a good start because you can see their mechanically doing thing .
but when we start thinking about computer computing thing we have a good reason to care .
and this is what we are what we are providing i think is a reason to care about a lot of these area of mathematical physic .
thats been thats been very nice .
i am not sure weve ever got to the the question of why doe the universe let talk about that .
we are it is not the simplest question in the world .
it take a few step to get to it .
and it is nevertheless even surprising that you can even begin to answer this question .
the next thing to perhaps understand is this idea of real space .
weve got physical space weve got branchial space the space of possible quantum history .
and now weve got another level of abstraction which is a space .
and here where that come from .
you say you say weve got this model for the universe weve got a particular rule .
and we run this rule and we get the universe. . thats thats interesting .
why that rule ?
why not another rule ?
and that confused me for a long time .
then i realized what if the thing could be using all possible rule ?
the next thing youd say is how can you get anything reasonable out ?
how can anything real come out of the set of all possible rule applied in all possible way ?
this is a subtle thing .
which i havent fully untangled .
the there is this object which is the result of running all possible rule in all possible way .
and you might say if you are running all possible rule why can not everything possible happen ?
the answer is because when you there this entanglement that occurs .
let say that you have a lot of different possible initial condition a lot of different possible state .
then you are applying these different rule .
some of those rule can end up with the same state .
it is not the case that you can get from anywhere to anywhere .
there this whole entangled structure of what can lead to what and there a definite structure thats produced .
i think i am going to call that definite structure of the ruley had the limit of the limit of all possible rule being applied in all possible way .
and you are saying that structure is finite that somehow connects to maybe similar thing is causal invariance .
there a rule .
necessarily ha go on variance .
thats a feature of thats a mathematical consequence of essentially using all possible rule plus universal computation give you the fact that for many diverging path you can always the path will always convert .
doe that say that the rule doe that in this facility in further that the ruley had is a finite ?
in the end it is not necessarily finite .
it is it is a it is a it is a it is the history of the universe may not be finite .
the history of the universe time may keep going forever .
you can keep running the computation of the ruley had and youll keep spewing out more and more and more structure .
it is time doesnt have to end .
it is it is some that that but the the issue is there are there are three limit that happen and this ruley had object .
one is how long you run the computation for .
another is how many different rule you are applying and another is how many different state you start from .
and the mixture of those three limit this is mathematically a horrendous object. ?
and whats whats interesting about this object is the one thing that doe seem to be the case about this object is it connects with idea in higher category theory .
and in particular it connects to some of the 20th century most abstract mathematics done by this chap growth and dec. groth and dec had a thing called the infinity groupoid which is closely related to this ruley had object .
although the detail the relationship i do not fully understand yet .
but i think that the whats whats interesting is this thing that is this very limiting object .
a way to think about this that again well well take u into another direction which is the equivalence between physic and mathematics .
the way that let see maybe this is to give a sense of this groupoid and thing that .
you can think about in mathematics you can think you have certain axiom they are atom and you let say let talk about mathematics for a second .
what is mathematics ?
what is what is it made of to speak ?
mathematics there a bunch of statement for addition x plus y is equal to y plus x. thats a statement in mathematics .
another statement would be x squared minus y is equal to x plus y minus y. there are infinite number of these possible statement of mathematics .
that mean that it give a statement but with x plus y it is a rule .
you can it is a rule .
it is a rule .
it is a rule .
it is also a thing that is true in mathematics. . the statement is true . . and what you can imagine is you you imagine laying out this giant ocean of all statement .
you first thought this is where this wa segueing into a different thing .
let me let me not go in this direction for a second .
thats not going to methamathematics yet .
yeah well maybe get to methamathematics but it is some let me explain the groupoid and thing later .
but let come back to the universe always a good place to be in .
what is the universe ha to do with the add the all space and how thats possible reconnected to why the thing exists at all and why there one of them .
here the point .
the thing that had confused me for a long time wa let say we get the rule for the universe .
we hold it in our hand .
we say this is our universe .
then the immediate question is why is not it another one ?
and thats the the the the lesson of coppana because it is we are not very special .
how come we got universe number three hundred and twelve and not universe quadrupling quadrupling quadrupling .
and i think the resolution of that is the realization that there that the universe is running all possible rule .
then you say how an earth do we perceive the universe to be running according to a particular rule ?
how do we perceive definite thing happening in the universe ?
it is the same story .
it is the observer .
there is a reference frame that we are picking in this royal space .
and that that is what determines our perception of the universe with our particular sensory information and on .
we are parsing the universe in this particular way .
here the way to think about it .
in in in physical space we live in a particular place in the universe .
and we could live in our first santorra but we do not we live here .
and similarly in royal space we could live in many different place in royal space .
but we happen to live here .
and what is it mean to live here ?
it mean we have certain sensory input .
we have certain way to parse the universe .
those are our interpretation of the universe .
what would it mean to travel in royal space ?
what it mean is that we are successfully interpreting the universe in different way .
in other word to be at a different point in royal space is to have a different in a sense a different interpretation of whats going on in the universe .
and we can imagine even thing an analog of the speed of light a the maximum speed of translation in royal space and on .
wait whats the interpretation ?
royal space and we a i am confused by the we in the interpretation and the universe i thought moving about in royal space change the way the universe is the way we would perceive it .
the way that thats the way that it is ultimately ha to do with the perception .
it doesnt royal royal space is not somehow changing branching into another universe something that .
no the point is that the whole point of this is the ruley ad is the encapsulated version of everything that is the universe running according to all possible .
yeah we think of our universe the observable universe a it is thing .
we are a little bit loose with the word universe then because wooden the had a potentially encapsulate a very large number commonatory large maybe infinite set of what we human physicist think of a universe .
thats an interesting interesting parsing of the word universe ?
because what we are saying is a were at a particular place in physical space we are at a particular place in royal space at that particular place in royal space our experience of the universe is this .
a if we live at the center of the galaxy our universe our experience of the universe will be different from the one it is given where we live .
and in u what we are saying is our when you might say in a sense this had a a super universe it is big .
but it is all entangled together .
it is not you can separate out .
you can say let me it is when we take a reference it is our experience of the universe is based on where we are in the universe .
we could imagine moving to somewhere else in the universe but it is still the same universe .
there not universe existing in parallel .
no because because and the whole point is that if we were able to change our interpretation of whats going on we could perceive a different reference frame in this ad .
yeah but thats not thats not thats yeah thats the same ad thats the same universe .
you are moving about these are coordinate in there. . the way thats the reason thats interesting is imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence .
the alien intelligence we should say the alien intelligence might live on alpha centauri but it might also live at a different place in real space .
yeah it can live here on earth .
it ha a different reference frame that includes a very different perception of universe. . and then because that real space is very large .
do we guy have communicate with them ? .
thats yeah but it is also one thing is how different the perception of the universe could be .
i think it could be bizarrely unimaginably completely different .
and one thing to realize is even in thing i do not understand i know about the western tradition of understanding science and all that thing .
and you talk to people who say i i am into some eastern tradition of this that and the other and it is obvious to me what how thing work i do not understand it at all but it is not obvious .
i think with this realization that there these very different way to interpret whats going on in the universe that give me at least state .
it doesnt help me to understand that different interpretation but it give me at least more respect for the possibility that there will be other interpretation .
yeah humbles you to the possibility that what is it reincarnation or all all these eternal recurrence with nature these idea yeah .
the thing that i realized about a bunch of those thing is that ive been doing my little survey of the history of philosophy trying to understand what can i say now about some of these thing ?
now we do not know how to extract it in our traditional scientific approach but it is still something where it is not a crazy thing to say there is something it doesnt weigh anything .
thats a a silly question how much doe it weigh ?
maybe it doesnt such a silly question in our model of physic because the actual computational activity ha a consequence of gravity and thing but thats a very subtle because if we start talking about mass and energy and on there could be a youve got a solar tron .
yes yes a particle that somehow contains on this .
but leibnitz had lost me at the following thing .
he said each of these monad ha a soul and each of them ha a consciousness and it is i am out of here .
i do not understand this at all .
i do not know whats going on but i realized recently that in his day the concept that a thing could do something could spontaneously do something .
that wa his only way of describing that .
and what i would now say a is this abstract rule that run to leibnitz that would have been in one thousand six hundred and ninety or whatever that would have been it ha a soul it ha a consciousness .
and in a sense it is one of these there an only new idea under the sun to speak thats thats a a version of the same kind of idea but couched in term that are bizarrely different from the one that we would use today .
would you be able to maybe play devil advocate on your conception of consciousness that the two characteristic of it that is constrained and there a single thread of time .
is it possible that leibnitz wa onto something that the basic adam the screweat adam of space ha a consciousness ?
is that these are word ?
but what is there ?
is there some sense where consciousness is much more fundamental than your making it seem ?
i think can you construct a world in which it is much more fundamental ?
and what would that be ?
and i think that come back to this question of can we whats it to be a cellular or a tromoton type thing ?
i am not yet there .
i think that this is a and i know not even know yet quite how to think about this .
the bed term this is a long time ago .
no it is recently .
recently they said it wa terrible .
thatd be interesting to see you write a short story based on what sound it is already inspiring short story by or story .
thats fiction writer .
but i think the the interesting thing for me is and what doe it what is it to be or whatever ?
how do you describe that ?
it is thats not a thing that you describe in mathematics .
the what is it to be such an such ?
whats he to me when you say what is it to be something presumes that you are talking about a singular entity ?
there a some feeling of the entity the stuff thats inside of it and the stuff thats outside of it .
and then thats when consciousness start making sense .
but then it seems that could be generalizable .
if you take some subset of a cellular time you could start talking about what doe that subset ?
i feel but then you can i think you can take arbitrary number of subset .
to me you and i individually are consciousness but you could also say the two of u together is a singular conscious .
i am not sure about that .
i think that the single threat of time thing may be pretty important .
and that a soon a you start saying there are two different thread of time .
there are two different experience .
and then we have to say how do they relate how they entangled with each other ?
that may be a different story of a thing that is not much what do the ant whats it to be an ant ?
where there a more collective view of the world to speak .
i think that this is i do not have a good my best thought is can we turn it into a human story ?
it is the question of when we try and understand physic can we turn that into something which is a human understandable narrative ?
and now whats it to be a such and such ?
maybe the only medium in which we can describe that is something fiction where it is you are telling the life story in that in that setting but i am this is this is beyond will i what ive yet understood how to do it .
sorry an ant is too low level ?
maybe you have to look at the ant colony .
because there some level of which it is a conscious being and then if you go to the planetary scale then maybe thats going too far .
there a nice sweet spot .
yeah consciousness .
they are always these different everybody ha their own theory of consciousness and they are very noninter interdiscussable .
and how doe it help me to say how do i go from this this incoherent collection of thing happening in the universe to our definite perception and definite law and on and that an an applied version of consciousness .
and and and i think the reason it is segue to a different topic but the reason that one of the thing i am particularly interested in is whats the analog of consciousness and system very different from brain .
and why is that matter ?
this whole description of this we havent talked about why the universe exists .
let get to why the universe exists .
and then we then we can talk about perhaps a little bit about what these model of physic show you about other kind of thing molecular computing and on .
but thats good .
why doe the universe exist ?
we finally more or le set the stage .
weve got this idea of this ad of this object that is made from following all possible rule the fact that it is not this incoherent mess it is got all this entangled structure in it and on. . what is this ad ?
it is the working out of all possible formal system .
the the the question of why doe the universe exist ?
it is core question which you started with is youve got two bus two equal four .
youve got some other abstract result but thats not actualized .
it is an abstract thing .
and when we say weve got a model for the universe .
it is this rule you run it and itll make the universe but it is but but but wheres it running ?
what what what is what is it doing ? ?
what what is is it actual or is it merely a formal description of something ? .
the thing to realize with this with this the thing about the rule you had is it is an inevitable it is the entangled running of all possible rule .
you do not get to say it is not you are saying which rule you had are you picking ?
because it is all possible formal rule .
it is not it is it is only footnote the only footnote it is an important footnote is it is all possible computational rule not hyper computational rule .
you can even now in touring you this that you could make oracle for touring machine where you say a touring machine can not solve the whole thing problem for touring machine .
you can imagine such a box .
you can not necessarily build one in the physical universe but you can imagine such a box .
and we could say in addition to in this rule you had we are imagining that there is a computational that at the end it is it is running rule that are computational .
it doesnt have a bunch of oracle black box in it .
turn out if there are oracle black box the rule that is you can make a super rule that contains those oracle black box but it ha a cosmological event horizon relative to the first one .
they can not communicate .
and thats what happens in an event horizon .
and what will happen between this the ordinary rule you had and the hyper rule you had is there is an event horizon and we in our rule you had will never know that there is there there there separate thing .
they are not they are not connected .
and maybe i am not understanding but because we can not observe it .
why doe that mean it doesnt exist ?
it might exist but it doe it is not clear what it is what to speak whether it exists what we are trying to understand is why doe our universe exist ?
we are not trying to ask the question what let me say another thing let me make a matter comment which is that i have not thought through this hyperrulead business properly .
i can not the hyperrulead is referring to a rulead in which hypercomputation is possible .
thats correct. . what the that footnote the footnote is we are not sure why this is important .
yeah thats .
it is already abstract enough .
the one question is we have to say if we are saying why doe the universe exist ?
one question is why is it this universe and not another universe ?
the the important point about this rulead idea is that it is in the rulead are all possible formal system .
there no choice being made .
there no there no we picked this particular universe and not that one .
thats the first thing .
the second thing is that we have to ask the question .
you say why doe two plus two equal four exist ?
thats not a that is a thing that necessarily is that way on the basis of the meaning of the term two and plus some equal and on. . the thing is that this this rulead object is in a sense a necessary object .
it is the thing that is the consequence of working out the consequence of the formal definition of thing .
it is not a thing where you are saying and this is picked a the particular thing .
this is something which necessarily is that thing because of the definition of what it mean to have computation .
it is a rulead it is a formal system .
where are we in this whole thing ?
we are part of this rulead .
and our there is no sense to say doe two plus two equal four exist ?
thats thats in some sense it necessarily exists .
it is a necessary object .
it is not a thing that where you can ask it is usually in and philosophy there a distinction made between necessary tool contingent truth analytic proposition synthetic proposition they are a variety of different version of this .
there are thing which are necessarily true based on the definition of term and there are thing which happen to be true in our universe .
but we do not exist in a realyear space .
thats one of the coordinate that define our existence .
yes yes but this ad is the set of all possible old coordinate .
what we are saying is it contains that .
what we are saying is we exist a our perception of whats going on is where it a particular place in this ad and we are concluding certain thing about how the universe work based on that .
but the question is do we understand is there something where we say why it doe it work that way ?
the answer is i think it ha to work that way because this there is not this ad is a necessary object in the sense that it is a purely formal object two plus two equal four .
it is not an object that wa made of something .
it is an object that is an expression of the necessary collection of formal relation that exist .
and then the issue is can we in our experience of that is it can we have table and chair to speak in that by virtue of our experience of that necessary thing ?
and what people have generally thought and ill say that that i do not know of a lot of discussion of this .
why doe the universe exist question ?
it is not a random arbitrary thing it is a thing with definite structure and that structure is the thing when we are embedded in that structure when an entity embedded in that structure perceives something which is then we can interpret a physic and thing this .
in other word we do not have to ask the question the the the why doe it exist ?
it necessarily exists .
i am missing this part .
why doesnt necessarily exist ?
you need to have it if you want to formalize the relation between entity but why did why do you need to have relation ?
let say you say it is why doe math have to exist ?
thats the same question .
let see i think the thing to think about is the existence of mathematics is something where given a definition of term what follows from that definition inevitably follows .
now you can say why define any term but in a sense the thats the definition of term i think the way to think about this let me see concrete term it is a very simple there are thing logical or whatever .
thats a thing thats a powerful thing .
it is a yeah but it is it is a the the point is that it is not a thing of that people imagine there is i do not know the an elephant or something or the elephant are presumably not necessary object .
they are they happen to exist a a result of biological evolution of whatever else but the the thing is that in some sense that there is it is a different thing to say doe plus exist ?
it is not it is not not an elephant .
that is we can certainly say there is a formal system that we can construct abstractly in our mind that is computation .
and that thats the we can we can imagine it ?
now the question is is it is that formal system once we exist a observer embedded in that formal system thats enough to have something which is our universe .
yeah and then what you are asking is perhaps is why the point is we definitely can imagine it .
there nothing that say that we are not saying that there it is inevitable that that is a thing that we can imagine .
we do not have to ask doe it exist ?
we are it is definitely something we can imagine .
now thats then we have this thing that is a formally constructible thing that we can imagine .
and now we have to ask the question what given that formally constructible thing what is what consequence doe that if we were to perceive that formally if we were embedded in that formally constructible thing what would be perceived about the world ?
and we would say we perceive that the world exists because we are we are seeing all of this mechanism of all these thing happening .
and but thats something that is a feature of it is something where we are see another way of asking this i am trying to get at i understand why it feel this ruliaid is necessary .
but maybe it is me being human but it feel then you should be able to not u but somehow step outside of the ruliaid .
whats outside the ruliaid ?
the ruliaid is all formal system .
there nothing because but that is what human would say .
is it possible to encode all once we is there something that is not what we can represent formally ? .
you can make a world that deal with all possible rule and then merely by virtue of living in a particular place in that world to speak we have the perception we have of what the world is .
ha been i would say one of the one of the one that you would think people will be most interested in but i think they are thats something complicated .
indeed having written quite a few article yourself you are now missing some of the piece .
and thats a weird thing because mathematics people have been very confused including me have been very confused about the the the the question of of what what is the foundation of mathematics ?
what is what a thing is mathematics ?
is mathematics something where we write down axiom euclid did for geometry and we build the structure and we could have written down different axiom wed have a different structure or is it something that ha a more fundamental truth to it ?
what i am increasingly coming to realize is that similar to saying let take it gas and break it down into molecule .
we see underside ability we see other thing this .
one of the thing ive always find very mysterious is that gerdels thurum show that there are thing which can not be finitely proved in mathematics .
there are proof of arbitrary length infinite length proof that you might need but in practical mathematics mathematician do not typically run into this .
the law of fluid mechanic are much more understandable than this underlying molecular dynamic .
thats the causal network of mathematics of what can prove what and on and you can say at any moment in the history of a mathematician of a single mathematical consciousness you are in a single slice of this metamathematical space .
a certain set of mathematical statement you can then deduce with proof you can deduce other one and on you are gradually moving through metamathematical space .
maybe tenzero individual little step to prove pythagoras theorem and one of the bizarre thing thats a an empirical fact i am trying to understand a little bit better .
if you look at different proof if you look at different formalized mathematics system they have different axiom underneath but they can all prove pythagoras theorem .
and in other word it is a little bit what happens with gas we can have air molecule we can have water molecule but they still have fluid dynamic both of them have fluid dynamic .
and similarly at the level that mathematics the mathematician care about mathematics it is way above the molecular dynamic to speak .
and there are all kind of weird thing for example one thing i wa realizing recently is that the quantum theory of mathematics thats a very bizarre idea .
but when you prove what is a proof is youve got one statement of mathematics you go through other statement you eventually get to a statement you are trying to prove for example thats a path in mathematical space .
and thats a single path a single proof is a single path .
but you can imagine there are other proof of the same result .
there are a bundle of proof .
there this whole set of possible proof .
because they give u branching similar to the quantum mechanic model that you were talking about .
and then there some invariance that you can formalize and then the same way that you can for the quantum mechanical. . the question is in proof space a you start thinking about multiple proof are there analog for example destructive interference of multiple proof ?
there a couple of day old not yet fully formed .
but a you try and do that when you have two different proof it is two photon going in different direction .
you have two proof which at an intermediate stage are incompatible .
and thats destructive interference .
it is a possible for this to instruct the engineering of automated proof system .
there a practical matter .
this whole question in fact jonathan gorard ha a nice heuristic for automated theorem proof thats based on our physic project that is looking for essentially using using energy in our model energy is the level of activity in this hypergraph .
and there a heuristic for automated theorem proving about how do you pick which path to go down that is based on essentially physic ?
and the thing that get interesting about this is the way that one can have the interplay between for example black hole what is a black hole in metamathematics ?
the answer is what is black hole in physic ?
black hole in physic is where in the simplest form of black hole time end that is all everything is crunched down to the space time singularity and everything end up at that singularity .
in our model and thats a little hard to understand in general to be with continuous mathematics and what doe the singularity look ?
in our model it is something very pragmatic .
it is you are applying these rule time is moving forward and then there come a moment where the rule no rule apply .
time stop .
it is the universe dy .
that nothing happens in the universe anymore .
in mathematics thats a decidable theory .
thats a theory .
theory which have underciderability which are thing arithmetic set theory all of serious model theory in mathematics .
they all have the feature that there are proof of arbitrary long length .
in something boolean algebra which is a decidable theory there are any question in boolean algebra .
you can go crunch crunch crunch and then a noin number of step you can answer it .
satisfiability might be hard but it is still a bounded number of step to answer any satisfiability problem .
and the notion of a black hole in physic where time stop thats analogous to in mathematics where there are not infinite length proof where when in physic you can wander around the universe forever if you do not run into a black hole .
if you run into a black hole in time stop you are done .
and it is the same thing in mathematics between decidable theory and underciderable theory .
thats an example .
and i think where the attempt to understand another question is what is the general activity of mathematics ?
what is the bulk theory of mathematics ?
in the literature mathematics there are about three million theorem that people have published .
and the question is whats that for mathematics ?
and a we explore what is for example for mathematics which is always like taking abstract limit .
an obvious abstract limit for mathematics to take is the limit of the future of mathematics .
that is what will be the ultimate structure of mathematics .
and one of the thing thats an empirical observation about mathematics thats quite interesting is that a lot of theory in one array of mathematics algebraic geometry or something might have they play into another array of mathematics .
that same the same a fundamental construct seem to occur in very different area of mathematics .
and that structurally captured a bit with category theory and thing that .
but i think that there probably an understanding of this mathematical space that will explain why different area of mathematics ultimately map into the same thing .
and my little challenge to myself is whats time dilation in in mathematics .
in other word a you a you a you move around in this mathematical space of possible statement whats how doe that moving around ?
it is whats happening is that a you move around in the space of mathematical statement it is you are changing from algebra to geometry to whatever else .
and you are trying to prove the same theorem .
but a you try if you keep on moving to these different place it is slower to prove that theorem because you keep on having to translate what you are doing back to where you started from .
and thats the beginning of the analog of time dilation in mathematics .
class test probably fractured the mention in this space a . this space is a very messy space .
this space is much messier than physical space .
even in the model of physic physical space is very tame compared to branchial space and real space .
the mathematical structure branchial space probably more hilbert space but it is a rather complicated hilbert space .
and one of the thing you can do you can think about is youve got between statement youve got proof and they are path between statements. . now you can go to the next level and you can ask what about a mapping from one proof to another ?
and thats in in category theory thats a higher category that notion of higher category where you are where you are mapping not between not between object but you are mapping between the mapping between object and on .
and you can keep doing that and you keep saying higher order proof i want mapping between proof between proof and on .
and that limiting structure by the way one thing thats very interesting is imagine in proof space youve got these two proof .
and the question is what is the topology of proofspace ?
in other word if you take these two path can you continuously deform them into each other where is there some big hole in the middle that prevents you from continuously deforming them one into the other ?
it is when you when you think about some i do not know some puzzle for example you are moving piece around on some puzzle .
and you can think about the space of possible state of the puzzle and you can make this graph that show from one state to the puzzle to another state of the puzzle and on .
and sometimes you can easily get from one state to any other state but sometimes therell be a hole in that space and therell be you always have to go around the circuitous route to get from here to there .
there will not be any direct way .
and thats a question of of whether there an obstruction in the space .
and the question is in proof space what is the what are what doe it mean if there an obstruction in proof space ?
yeah i do not even know what an obstruction mean in proof space because for it to be an obstruction it should be reachable some other way from some other place .
this is on an unreachable part of the graph .
no it is not an unreachable part .
it is a part where there are path that go one way there are path that go the other way .
and this question of homotopi and mathematics is this question can you continuously deform from one path to another path or do you have to go in a jump to speak ?
but when youve got something that wind all the way around a cylinder you can not continuously deform that down to a point because it is stuck wrapped around .
my intuition about proof space is you should be of the deformant .
that because then otherwise it doesnt even make sense because if the topology matter of the way you move about the space that i do not even know what that mean .
what it would mean is that you would have one way of doing a proof of something over here in algebra .
and another way of doing a proof of something over here in geometry and there would not be an intermediate way to map between those proof .
but how would that be possible if they started the same place and ended the same place ?
it is the same thing a weve got point on a if weve got pod on a cylinder .
now you understand how it work in physical space but it doesnt it feel proof space shouldnt have that. . i am not sure .
i do not know .
well know very soon because we get to do some experiment .
this is the great thing about this stuff is that in fact i am in the next few day i hope to do a bunch of experiment on this .
you are playing proof in this space .
this is toy theory and weve got good this segue is to perhaps another thing which is this whole idea of multi computation .
this this some is another bigger idea that this ha to do with how do you make model of thing ?
and it is going to it is some ive claimed that theyve been four epoch in the history of making model of thing .
and and that this multi computation thing is is the fourth is a new epoch .
what is the first three ?
the first one is is back in antiquity .
ancient greek time people were whats the universe made of ?
it is made of everything is water thalies or everything is made of atom .
it is what are thing made of ?
or there are these crystal sphere that represent where the planet are and on .
it is a structural idea of how the universe is constructed .
there no real notion of dynamic .
it is what is the universe ?
how is the universe made ?
then we get to the 1600s and we get to the revolution of mathematics being introduced into physic .
and then we have this idea of you write down some equation the what happens in the universe is the solving of that equation time enters but it is usually a parameter .
we can slide it back and forth and say his his where it is .
then we come to this computational idea that i started pushing in the in the early 1980s a a result the thing that we were talking about before about complexity that wa my motivation .
but the bigger story wa the story of computational model of thing .
and the big difference there from the mathematical model is the mathematical model there an equation you solve it you go slide time to the place where you want it .
in computational model you give the rule and they say go run the rule .
and time is not something you get to slide time is something where it you run the rule time go in step and thats how you work out what the system behaves .
you do not time is not a parameter time is something that is about the running of these of these rule .
and there this computational ability ability you can not jump ahead in time but there still important thing there still one thread of time .
it is still the case the cellular automaton state and it ha the next state and the next state and on .
the thing that is we tipped off by quantum mechanic in a sense although it it feed back even into dual relativity and thing that that there these multiple thread of time .
and in this multicomputation paradigm the idea is instead of they are being the single thread of time they are these distributed asynchronous thread of time that are happening .
and the thing thats different there is if you want to know what happened if you say what happened in the system in the case of the computational paradigm you say after a thousand step we got this result .
but in the multicomputation paradigm after a thousand step not even a little bit of thousand step mean because we got all these different thread of time .
but there is no state .
there all these different possible there all these different path .
and the only way you can know what happened is to have some observer who is saying here how to parse the result of what wa going on .
but that observer is embedded in they do not have a complete picture .
in the case of physic thats .
and then but thats but the idea is that in this multicomputation setup that it is this idea of these multiple thread of time and model that are based on that .
and this is similar to what people think about in nondetermined state computation .
you have a term machine usually it ha a definite state it follows another state follows another state .
but typically what people have done when theyve thought about these kind of thing is theyve said there are all these possible path .
and nondeterminedistic term machine can follow all these possible path but we want one of them .
we want the one thats the winner that factor the number or whatever else .
and similarly it is the same story in logic programming and on .
but we say weve got this goal find u a path to that goal .
i want one path that i am happy .
or theorem proving same story .
i want one proof and then i am happy .
whats happening in multicomputation in physic is we care about many path .
and there is a case for example probabilistic programming is a version of multicomputation in which you are looking at all the path you are asking for probability of thing .
but in a sense in physic we are taking different kind of sampling for example in quantum mechanic we are taking a different sampling of all these multiple path .
in other word that by the very structure of this multicomputational setup it inevitably is the case that you have certain emergent law .
now why is this perhaps not surprising in thermodynamics since statistical mechanic there are inevitable emergent law of gas dynamic there are independent of the of the detail of the molecular dynamic the same thing .
and then what i realized is and then you might say now weve got multicomputation it is even worse .
it is one thread of time that we can not explain .
it is all these thread of time .
we can not explain anything .
but the following thing happens because there is all this irreducibility and any detailed thing you might want to answer it is very hard to answer .
but when you have an observer who ha certain characteristic computational boundedness sequentiality of time and on that observer only sample certain aspect of this incredible complexity going on in this multicomputational system .
and that is sensitive only to some underlying core structure of this multicomputational system .
there is all this irreducible computation going on all these detail .
but to that observer whats important is only the core structure of multicomputation which mean that observer observes comparatively simple law .
and i think it is inevitable that that observer observes law which are mathematically structured general television quantum mechanic which by the way are the same law in our model of physic .
thats the next explanation why there simple law that explain a lot for this observer .
potentially yes but what the place where this get interesting is there are all these field of science where people have gotten stuck where they say wed love to have a physic theory of economics .
wed love to have a physic lore and linguistics .
is that a talk about molecular biology here ?
where doe multicomputation come in for biology ?
eccanolics is super interesting too but biology .
let talk about that .
let talk about chemistry for a second .
i have to say this is such a weird business for me because there are these paradigmatic idea and then the actual application .
and it is ive always said i know nothing about chemistry i learned all the chemistry i know the night before some exam when i wa fourteen year old but ive learned a bunch more chemistry .
and in more from language these day we have pretty nice symbolic representation of chemistry .
and in understanding the design of that i am i think learned to set them out of chemistry .
if you quizzed me on basic high school chemistry i would probably fail .
but but what is chemistry ?
chemistry is a story of chemical reaction are youve got this particular chemical thats represented a some graph of these are this configuration of molecule with these bond and on .
and a chemical reaction happens .
youve got these two graph .
they interact in some way .
youve got another graph or multiple other graph out .
thats the the the abstract view of whats happening in chemistry .
and when you do a chemical synthesis for example you are given certain these are possible reaction that can happen .
and your ask can you piece together this a sequence of such reaction a sequence of such axiomatic reaction usually called name reaction in chemistry ?
can you piece together a sequence of these reaction that you get out at the end this great molecule we were trying to synthesize .
and thats a story of very much theorem proving .
and people have done they started in the 1960s looking at the theorem proving approach to that although it did not it did not it did not done too early i think .
but anyway thats the view is that chemistry chemical reaction are the story of all these different path of possible thing that go on .
let let go to an even lower level .
let say instead of asking about which specie of molecule we are talking about let look at individual molecule .
and let say we are looking at individual molecule and they are having chemical reaction and we are building up this big graph of all these reaction that are happening .
then weve got this big graph and by the way that big graph is incredibly similar to this hypergraphy writing thing .
but then you have to there a lot of work to be done on update rule .
in term of what they offer chemistry ?
yeah but they are for our observed chemistry .
yes indeed yes indeed .
weve been working on that because we have this beautiful system and well from language for representing chemistry symbolically .
we have this is a this is an ongoing thing to figure out what they offer some practical case .
doe that require human injection or can it be automatically discovered these update rule ?
in the boundary chemistry better we can probably discover the modematic that i think in in reality now it is they are these particular reaction .
and to understand whats going on we are probably going to pick a particular subtype of chemistry and because explain where this is going .
the place that here where this is going .
got this whole network of all these molecule having all these reaction and on .
and this is some whole multi computational story because each each chemical reaction event is it own separate event where we are saying they all happen asynchronously .
we are not describing in what order they happen maybe that order is governed by some quantum mechanic thing doesnt matter .
we are saying they happen in some order .
and then we ask what is the whats the how do we think about the system ?
this thing is some big multi computational system .
the question is what is the chemical observer ?
and one possible chemical observer is all you care about is did you make that particular drug molecule ?
you are asking for the one path no thing you might care about is i want to know the concentration of each specie .
i want to know at every stage i am going to solve the differential equation that represent the concentration and i want to know what those all are .
but there more because when it is you are going below in statistical mechanic there all these molecule bouncing around and you might say we are going to ignore we are going to look at the aggregate density of certain kind of molecule .
but you can look at a lower level you can look at this whole graph of possible interaction .
and the the idea would be what is the only chemical observer one who care about overall concentration ?
or can there be a chemical observer who care about this network of what happened ?
and that the question then is let me give an analogy .
this is where i think this is potentially very relevant to molecular biology molecular computing .
when we think about a computation usually we say it is input it is output we or chemistry we say there this input we are going to make this molecule a the output .
but what if what we encode what if our computation what other thing we care about is some part of this dynamic network ?
what if it is not the input and the output that we care about ?
what if there some dynamic of the network that we care about ?
now imagine you are a chemical observer what is a chemical observer ?
in molecular biology there are all kind of weird sort of observer there are membrane that exist that have different kind of molecule that combine to them thing this .
it is not obvious that the from a human scale we measure the concentration of something is the relevant story .
we can imagine that for example when we look at this whole network of possible reaction we can imagine a physical level we can imagine what wa the actual momentum direction of that of that molecule ?
what wa it which we do not pay any attention to when we are talking about chemical concentration ?
what wa the orientation of that molecule ?
these kind of thing .
and here the place where i have a little suspicion ?
one of the question in biology is what matter in biology ?
and that is we have all these chemical reaction we have all these all these molecular process going on in biological system what matter ?
and one of the thing is to be able to tell what matter a big story of the what matter question wa what happened in genetics in one thousand nine hundred and fifty three when dna when it wa figured out how dna worked .
because before that time genetics have been all these different effect and complicated thing and then it wa realized there something new a molecule constor information which wasnt obvious before that time .
a single molecule constor information .
there a place where there can be something important thats happening in molecular biology and it is in the sequence thats storing information in a molecule .
the possibility now is imagine this dynamic network this causal graph and multiway causal graph and on that represent all of these different reaction between molecule .
what if there is some aspect of that that is storing information thats relevant for molecular biology ?
in the dynamic aspect of that ?
yes thats .
that it is similar to how the structure of a dna molecule store information .
it could be the dynamic of the system some of the store information and this process might allow you to give prediction of what that would be .
yes but also imagine that you are trying to do for example imagine you are trying to do molecular computation .
you might think the way we are going to do molecular computation is we are going to run the thing we are going to see what came out .
we are going to see what molecule came out .
this is saying thats not the only thing you can do .
there is a different chemical observer that you can imagine constructing which is somehow sensitive to this dynamic network .
exactly how that work how we make that measurement i do not know but a few idea but thats whats important to speak .
and that mean by the way you can do the same thing even for turn machine you can say if you have a multilayturing machine you can say how do you compute with a multilayturing machine ?
you can not say what we got this input and this output because the thing ha all these thread of time it is got lot of output .
and then you say what doe it even mean to be a universal multilayturing machine ?
i do not fully know the answer to that .
it is an interesting idea who would freak touring out for sure because then the dynamic of the trajectory the computation matter .
yes yes but the thing is that this is again a story of whats the observer to speak can chemistry whats the observer that ?
is it some cell sitting in our bone marrow that is living for the whole of our life thats going to spring into action a soon a we are shown the same antigen or is it something different from that ?
is it something more dynamic ?
when you say shape space the shape of the molecule this is it could be deeply connected to the protein the multiproaching folding all of that stuff .
to be able to say something interesting about the the dance of protein thats exactly that .
then ha an impact on helping develop drug for example or ha an impact on biology immunology helping .
i think the biggest thing is when we think about molecular biology the what what is the qualitative way to think about it ?
in other word is it chemical reaction network ? ?
is it genetics dna big big news it is of there a digital aspect of the whole thing .
what is the qualitative way to think about how thing work in biology ?
and the question is what is the overarching representation that we can now start to think about using a microbiology ?
it is in the dynamic structure of this network .
and thats the thats the the the the potential there and it is it is these thing are i do not know it is it is for me it is it is i am not that wa not a a view .
i thought about molecular computing for age and age and age and age .
and ive always imagined that the big story is the the original promise of nanotechnology of can we make a molecular scale constructor that will build build a molecule in any shape ?
i do not think i am now increasingly concluding thats not the big point .
the big point is something more dynamic that will be an interesting end point for any of these thing but thats perhaps not the thing because the one example we have i am computing thats working is a biological organism .
and maybe the thing thats important there is not this what chemical do you make to speak but more this dynamic process .
dynamic process and then you can have a good model the hypografted to the explorer what simulated again make prediction and if they i think have a way to reason about biology .
it is hard by first of all biology doesnt have theory physic .
physic is a much more successful global theory area .
biology whether the global theory of biology pretty much darwinian evolution thats the only global theory of biology .
are there any other theory say the kidney work this way the this thing work this way and on .
there is not i suppose another global theory is digital information in dna .
thats another global fact about biology .
but the difficult thing to do is to match something you have a model of in the hypografted the actual how do you discover the theory ?
how do you discover the theory ?
you have something that look nice and make sense but you have to match it to validation and make sure .
and thats tricky because you are walking around the dark .
not entirely .
for example and what weve been trying to think about is take actual chemical reactions. . one of my goal is can i compute the prime with molecule ?
thats if i can do that then i maybe i can compute thing .
and there this nice automated lab these guy these emerald cloud lab people have built with wolf and lange and on .
that would be that would be an example of where and that would be with a particular framework for doing the molecular computing with particular kind of molecule and there a lot of ambient technological mess to speak associated with is it carbon ?
is it that is it important that there a bromine atom here etc etc etc etc .
this is all chemistry that i do not know much about .
and thats a unfortunately thats down at the level i would to be at the software level not at the level of the transistor to speak .
but in chemistry there a certain amount we have to do i think at the level of transistor before we get up to being able to do it although automated lab certainly help in setting that up .
i talked to a guy named charles hoskinson .
he mentioned that he collaborating with you .
he an interesting guy .
he sends me paper on speaking of automated theorem proving a lot .
he exceptionally read on that area a . whats the nature of your collaboration with him ?
he the creator of cardano or the nature of the color collaboration between cardano and the whole space of blockchain and we are from alpha we are from blockchain are that stuff ?
we are segueing to a we are a slightly different world but although not completely unconnected the whole thing is somehow connected .
i know i know the strange thing in my life is ive alternated between doing basic science and doing technology about five time in my life far .
and the thing thats crazy about it is every time i do one of these alternation i think there not going to be a way back to the other thing .
and i thought for this physic project i thought we are doing fundamental theory of physic maybe itll have an application in two hundred year .
but now ive realized this multicomputation idea is applicable here and now it is an in fact it is also giving u this way .
ill mention one of the thing and then then well talk about blockchain .
what do you mean one third of a century is in mean thirty three or thirty what are we first three or third ?
thirty three or thirty three .
but ive never heard of anyone celebrating that anniversary but i it .
and it is i think it is cool that we can still run mathematical version one program today and on and weve maintained compatibility and weve been building this big tower all those year of more and more and more computational capability .
it is interesting we made this picture of the different thread of of computational content of mathematical content and all sort of thing with data and graph and whatever else .
and what in this picture is about the first ten year it is it is a few thread .
and then then about maybe fifteen twenty year of explodes in this whole collection of different thread of all these different capability that are now part of all from language and representing different thing in the world .
but the thing that wa super lucky in some sense is it is all based on one idea .
it is all based on the idea of symbolic expression and transformation rule for symbolic expression which wa what i originally put into this sp system back in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine that wa a predecessor of the whole of language stack .
that idea wa an idea that i got from trying to understand mathematical logic and on .
it wa my attempt to make a general human comprehensible model of computation of everything a a symbolic expression and all you do is transform some market prescience .
and in retrospect i wa very lucky that i understood a little a i understood then because had i understood more i would have been completely freaked out about all the different way that that model can fail .
because what do you do when you have a symbolic expression you make transformation for symbolic expression ?
for example one question is there maybe many transformation that could be made in a very multicomputational way .
but what we are doing is picking we are using the first transformation that applies .
and we keep doing that until we reach a fixed point .
and thats the result .
and thats a very it is a way of sliding around the edge of multicomputation .
and back when i wa working on smp and thing i thought about these question about how how what determines the this evaluation path .
for example you work out fibonacci .
fibonacci is a recursive thing .
and you get this whole tree of recursion ?
and there the question of how do you evaluate that tree of recursion ?
depth first where you go all the way down one side .
do you do it breadth first ?
or you are collecting the term together ?
or that f of eight plus f of seven f of seven plus f of six .
you can collect the f of 7 . and on these are i did not realize that at the time funny i wa working on on gauge field theory back in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine .
and i wa also working on the evaluation model in smp under the same problem .
but it took me forty more year to realize that .
and this question about how you do this evaluation front ?
thats a question of reference frame .
it is a question of the story of that thats that is this question of in what order is the universe evaluated ?
and that and what you realize is there this whole world of different kind of computation that you can do multicomputationally .
and thats a thats an interesting thing and ha a lot of implication for distributed computing and on .
it also ha a potential implication for blockchain which we havent fully worked out which is some and this is not what we are doing with cardano but this is a different thing .
the this is something where one of the question is when you have in a sense blockchain is a deeply sequentialised story of time .
because in blockchain there one copy of the of the ledger and you are saying this is what happened time is progressed in this way .
yeah but distributed consensus that still ha a sequential there still sequentiality to tell me you are thinking through how to apply multicomputation to blockchain yes .
it is whats happening is there different path of history that correspond to in one path of history youve got paid this amount in another path of history youve got paid this amount .
in the end the universe will always become consistent .
now the way it work is it is a little bit more complicated than that .
what happens is the way space knitted together in our theory of physic is through all these event .
and the the the idea is that the way that economic space knitted together is but is there these autonomous event that essentially knitted together economic space .
there are all these thread of transaction that are happening and the question is can they be made consistent ?
are there is there something forcing them to be a consistent fabric of economic reality ?
and what this ha led me to is trying to realize how doe economics fundamentally work ?
and what is economics ?
and what are the atom of economics to speak ?
and what ive realized is that that the perhaps i do not even know if this is yet .
there event and economics that transaction there are state of agent that are the atom of economics .
and then transaction are agent transact and some the the the transites in some way and thats an event .
and then the question is how do you knit together economics space from that ?
what is there an economic space ?
all these transaction there a whole complicated collection of possible transaction .
but one thing thats true about economics is we tend to have the notion of a definite value for thing .
we could imagine that you buy a cookie from somebody and they want to get a movie ticket and there is some way that ai bot could make some path from the cookie to the movie ticket by all these different intermediate transaction .
and my my guess is that the yet again it is crazy that all these thing are connected .
this is another multicomputation story another story of where whats happening is that the economic consciousness the economic observer is not going to deal with all of those a different microscopic transaction .
they are going to parse the whole thing by saying there this value it is a number .
and thats thats their understanding of their summary of this economic network .
and there will be all kind of thing their all kind of arbitrage opportunity which are the quantum effect and this whole thing .
and thats and place where there different path that can be followed and on .
and the question is come one make a global theory of economics .
and then my test case say again what is time dilation in economics ?
and you can get a little bit of an analogy there .
but i think there a there a better and more complete analogy .
and thats the question of is there a theory general relativity that is a global theory of economics ?
and is it about something we care about ?
if i am prepared to wait a while then itll be much more certain .
and there is there a way of using and weve made a bunch of prototype of this which i am not yet happy with but i realized is to understand these prototype i have to have a foundational theory of economics .
and thats a it may be that we could deploy up one of these prototype a a practical system but i think it is going to be much better if we have an understanding of how this plug into economics .
that mean a fundamental theory of transaction between entity .
thats how you mean by economics .
yes i think but how they are emerged law of economics .
i do not even know when ive been asking friend of mine who are economist and thing what is economics ?
is it an axiomatic theory ?
is it a theory that is a a qualitative description theory ?
is it what a theory is it ?
and it is not a mathematical story .
it is a story of a different type of thinking about these thing .
by the way evolution or biology is yet another place where it look this multicompetational idea can be applied .
and thats where we are maybe speciation is related to thing event horizon and a a whole whole other world of that .
but because it seems this model can be applicable a many aspect the different level of understanding of our reality .
it can be the biology of the chemistry the physic level the economics and you can potentially say the thing is it is sure at all these level it might rhyme it might make sense a a model .
the question is can you make useful prediction a one of these level ?
and thats a question of it is a weird situation because the situation where the model probably ha definite consequence the question is are they consequence we care about ?
and thats some and in the case of in the economic case the we are one thing is this idea of using physic notion to construct to distribute it analog of blockchain .
the much more pragmatic thing is a different direction .
and it ha to do with this computational language that we built to describe the world that know about different kind of cooky and know about different city and know about how to compute all these kind of thing .
one of the thing that is of interest is if you want to run the world you need with with contract and law and rule and on there are rule at a human level and there are thing and this this get one into the idea of computational contract .
now when we write a contract it is a piece of legalese it is it is written in english and it is not something thats automatically analyzable executable whatever else .
it is english back in got freedliving it is back in one thousand six hundred and eighty or whatever wa figure out how to use logic to decide legal case and on .
and he had this idea of let make a computational language for the human law forget about modeling nature forgot about natural law what about human law can we make a computational representation of that ?
i think finally we are close to being able to do that .
it is finishing the job of being able to represent everything the conversation we are having in computational term .
and one of the use case for that is computational contract .
another use case is something the the constitution that say what the ai is what we want the ai to do .
but this is useful you are saying these are you are saying computation contract but the smart contract this is whats in the domain of cryptocurrency is known a smart contract .
and the language youve developed this symbolic or seek to further develop symbolic discourse language enables you to write a contract in to contract that originally represents the sum a particular world yeah .
but smart contract tend to be now mostly about thing happening on the blockchain .
sometimes they have article and in fact wolf malfa api is the main thing people use to get information about the real world to speak within smart contract .
wolf malfa a it stand is a good oracle .
whoever want to use it thats perhaps where the relationship with the current down over .
yeah how we started getting involved with block chance we realized people were using wolf malfa a the oracle for smart contract to speak .
and that got u interested in block chance in general .
and what wa ended up happening is wolf and language is with it symbolic representation of thing is very good at representing thing block chain .
and weve weve published some sample of how that work .
but but it is because our technology stack both in language and mathematical are very widely used in the quant finance world there a there a immediate coevolution there of the quant finance thing and block chain analytics .
and thats some .
it is the representation of block chain in computational language .
then ultimately it is how do you run the world with code ?
and there a there a whole story to to that .
and of course i i to always pay attention to the latest thing that are going on and i i i block chain because it is a it is a it is another rethinking of computation .
and it is cloud computing wa a little bit of that of persistent computational resource and on .
and this multicomputation is a big rethinking of what it mean to compute .
block chain is another bit of rethinking of what it mean to compute the idea that you lodge these autonomous lump of computation out there in the blockchain world .
and one of the thing that for fun to speak is weve been doing a bit of stuff with nfts and we did some nfts on godana and we are doing some more .
and we did some cellular autonomous nfts on godana where he quite a bit .
and ive i do not think this is it is realizing maybe it is not coincidental that i am the human who recorded more about themselves than anybody else .
and then i end up with these science result let say history matter which wa not those those thing i did not think those were connected but there at least correlating yes .
but that mean that pay once and you are you are lodged in the blockchain forever .
and weve been playing around with the a hobby thing of mine of thinking about the nfts and how you the consumer idea of the it is the it is the anti it is the opposite of the snapchat view of the world .
there a permanent to it this heavily incentivized and thereby you are going to have permanence of history. . and thats the now thats thats one of the thing weve been doing with cardano and it is fun .
i think that that this whole question about you mentioned automated theorem proving and block chain and on .
and a ive thought about this physic inspired distributed blockchain obviously there the the proof that it work that there no double spends there no whatever else .
that proof becomes a very formal almost a matter of physic to speak .
and it is been it is been an interesting thing for the for the practical block chain to do actual automated theorem proving and i do not think anybodys managed it in an interesting case yet .
it is a thing that people aspire to but i think it is a challenging thing because the point is one of the one of the thing about proving correctness of something is people say ive got this program and i am going to prove it is correct .
and it is what doe that mean ?
you have to say what correct mean ?
it is it is then you have to have another language and people very confused back and pause decade of we are going to prove the correctness by representing the program and another language which we also do not know whether it is correct .
and often by correctness we mean it can not crash or it can not scribble or memory but the thing is that there this complicated tradeoff because a soon a there a soon a you are using computation you have computational irreducibility you have an asideability .
if you want to use computation you have to let go of the idea that you are going to be able to box it in and say we are going to have this happen and not anything else .
this is an old fact .
godless theorem try to say piano arithmetic the axon of arithmetic can you box in the integer and say these axon give the integer and nothing but the integer .
godless theorem showed that wasnt the case .
there a you can have all these wild weird thing that are obey the piano axon but on integer .
and there this infinite hierarchy of additional axon you would have to add .
and it is the same thing .
you do not get to if you want to say i want to know what happens you are boxing yourself in and there a limit to what can happen to speak .
it is a complicated tradeoff and it is a it is a it is a big tradeoff for ai to speak .
it is do you want to let computation do what it can do ?
or do you want to say no it is very very boxed into the point where we can understand every step .
and thats a thats a thing that that that becomes difficult to do .
but thats some in general i would say one of the thing thats complicated in my life and the whole story of computational language and all this technology and science and on .
i in the flow of one life it is interesting to see how these thing play out because i ive concluded that the business of making artifact from the future which mean there are thing that ive done .
i do not know this physic project .
i do not know where anybody would have gotten to it for fifty year .
the fact that mathematics is a third of a century old and i know that the bunch of the core idea are not absorbed .
that is people finally got this idea that i thought wa a triviality of notebook .
that wa twenty five year .
and some of these core idea about symbolic computation and on and not absorbed .
people people use them every day in wolf from language and do all kind of cool thing with them .
but if you say what is the fundamental intellectual point here ?
it is it is not absorbed .
and it is something where you realize that you are building thing and i i made this this thing about we are building artifact from the future to speak .
and i mentioned that it is our we have a conference every coming up in a couple of week annual technology conference where we talk about all the all the thing we are doing .
but but then i i realized people were telling me afterwards thats exactly how we are using wolf and language in some particular setting and some computational x field or some organization or whatever .
and it is people are saying what did you manage to do ?
what we know that imprint the bullet will be possible to do that .
but we did not know that wa possible now .
and it is thats the thats the business we are in .
i think we nailed that .
the answer is in the computational universe even simple program make it and thats the secret that nature ha that allows you to make it .
thats the thats that part .
but the bigger picture there wa this idea of this computational paradigm the idea that you could go beyond mathematical equation which have been the primary modeling medium for three hundred year .
and it wa look it is an extraably the case that people will use program rather than equation .
to be fair i now realize on a little bit more analysis of what people said in pretty much every field other than physic people said these are new model .
thats pretty interesting .
in physic people were weve got our physic model .
we are very happy with them .
physic there more resistance because of the attachment and the power of the equations. . the idea that program might be the way to approach this field that wa there some resistance .
and you are saying it take time for somebody who like the idea of time dilation and all these application i thought you would understand this .
but but and computational energy stability .
yes exactly .
but but it is interesting that twenty year the span of twenty year it is gone from pitchfork and horror to yeah we get it .
and it is helped that weve in our current effort and environmental physic weve gotten a lot further .
and weve managed to put a lot of puzzle piece together that make sense .
but the thing that ive been thinking about recently is this field of complexity .
ive wa a a field builder back in the 1980s .
i wa can we id understood this point that there wa a fundamental phenomenon of complexity .
it showed up in lot of place .
and i wa this is an interesting field of science .
and i wa recently wa reminded i wa at this the very first get together of what became the santa fe institute .
and i wa in fact there even an audio recording of me saying people have been talking about or what should this outfit do and i wa saying there is this thing that ive been thinking about .
it is this idea of complexity .
and it is and thats thats what that ended up in the plant .
and you plan to see the complexity of santa fe a beautiful a the beautiful vision .
but that but whats happened then is this idea of complexity and kind and i started the first research center at university of illinois for doing that and the first journal complex system and on .
and it is an interesting thing in my life at least that it is you plant this seed .
you have this idea .
it is a a science idea .
you have this idea of focusing on the phenomenon of complexity .
the deeper idea wa this computational paradigm .
but the nominal idea is this idea of complexity .
then you roll time forward thirty year or whatever thirty five year whatever it is .
and you say what happened ?
now there are a thousand complexity institute around the world .
i think more or le weve been trying to count them .
and there are forty complexity journal i think .
and it is what happened in this field ?
and i look at a lot of what happened and i am i have to admit to some eye rolling it is peak .
because it is what is whats going on ?
what people definitely got wa this idea of computational model .
and then they got but they thought one of the cognitive mistake i think is they say weve got a computational model .
and it and we are looking at a system thats complex .
and our computational model give complexity .
by godly that must mean it is .
and unfortunately because complexity is a generic phenomenon the computationality of the disability is a generic phenomenon that tell you nothing .
and then the question is what can you do ?
there a lot of thing that have been done under this banner of complexity .
and the thing ha been very successful in providing an interdisciplinary way of connecting different field together and powerful in itself. . thats a very useful mechanism .
yeah it is. . it is a little nice and principle .
but in the end a lot of that is around this computational paradigm computational modeling thats the raw material that power that that correspondence i think .
and the question is what is the i wa thinking recently weve been the other weve been weve been for year people have told me you should start some wolfman institute that doe basic science .
what i have is a company that build software and we we have a little piece that doe basic science a a hobby .
people are saying you should start this wolfman institute thing .
and ive been because ive known about lot of institute and ive seen their flow of money and what happens in different situation and on .
ive been reluctant but ive but ive i have realized that what weve done with our company over the last thirty five year we built a very good machine for doing rd and innovating and creating thing .
and i applied that machine to the physic project .
thats how we did the physic project in a fairly short amount of time with efficient machine with various people involved and on .
and it work for basic science and it is we can do more of this .
and no arjun can not we say it is become an institute .
yes it need to become an institute .
and thats crucial .
the thing that i wa thinking about what do we do with complexity ?
what what there are all these people who what what should happen to that field .
and what i realized is there this area of foundation of complexity thats about these question about simple program what they do thats far away from a bunch of the detail of application that people it is not far away .
it is the it is the under the the bedrock underneath those application .
i realized recently this is my recent little innovation of a sort a post that ill do very soon .
they are about the foundation of complexity what are there ?
i think there are two idea two conceptual idea that i hadnt enunciated i think before one is what i call metamodeling the other is rulliology .
what is metamodeling ?
metamodeling is youve got this complicated model and it is a model of hedgehog interacting with this interacting with that .
and the question is whats underneath that ?
what is it ?
is it a touring machine ?
what is the underlying stuff underneath that model ?
and there this metastion a question of given these model what is the core model ?
and i realized to me thats a lot of obvious question but then i realized ive been doing language design for forty year and language design is exactly that question .
underneath all of this detailed stuff people do what are the underlying primitive ?
and thats a question people havent tended to ask about model .
they say weve got this nice model for this and that and the other whats underneath it ?
and what because once you have the thing thats underneath it for example this multicompetition idea is an ultimate metamodling idea because it is saying underneath all these field is one paradigmatic structure .
and you can imagine the same thing that much more much shallower level in different kind of modeling .
the first activity is this metamodling the the model about model to speak .
what is the whats whats drilling down into model ?
thats one thing .
the other thing is this thing that i think we are going to call rulialogy which is the youve got these simple rule youve got cellular automaton youve got terrain machine youve got substitution system youve got registered machine youve got all these different thing .
what do they do in the wild ?
it is youve got some what is it is it mathematics ?
no it is not mathematics .
in fact from my now understanding of mathematics i understand that it is the molecular dynamic level .
it is not the level that mathematician have traditionally cared about .
it is not computer science because computer science is about writing program that do thing that were for a purpose not program in the wild to speak .
it is not physic it doesnt have anything to do with it may be underneath some physic but it is not physic a such .
it hasnt had a home .
it is still here today .
you find an icosdehedron that somebody made an ancient egypt .
thats a very modern thing .
it is an icosdehedron .
it is a timeless activity .
and this idea of studying simple rule and what they do it is a timeless activity .
and i can see that over the last forty year or a even with cellular automaton it is you can catalogue what are the different cellular automaton used for ?
and the simplest rule one you might even know this one rule one hundred and eighty four .
it is some rule one hundred and eighty four is a minimal model for road traffic flow .
and it is also a minimal model for various other thing .
but it is fun that you can say rule ninety is a minimal model for this and this and this and this rule four is a minimal model for this .
and it is remarkable that you can buy in this rural level of this study of rule they then branched their their the raw material that you can use to make model of different thing .
it is a it is a very pure basic science .
but it is one that people have explored it but theyve been a little bit in the wilderness .
and i think one of the thing that i would to do finally is i wa thought that this notion of pure and chaos pure and and chaos being the acronym for my book new science wa something that people should be doing .
and we tried to figure out whats the institutional structure to do this stuff ?
we dealt with a bunch of university can we do this here ?
what department would be in a it is not in a department it is it own new thing .
thats why thats why the book wa called the new science .
it is the because thats an increasingly good description of what it is to speak .
we are where we were thinking about the logical society because we are realizing that it is it is some it is very it is very interesting .
ive never done something this before because there this whole group of researcher who have been doing thing that are in some case very elegant very surviving very solid here this thing that happens in this very abstract system .
but it is it is what is that part of ?
it is it doesnt have a home .
and i think thats something i fault myself for not having been more when complexity wa developing in the 80 i did not understand the the the danger of application .
that is it is cool that you can apply the stikonomics and you can apply it to the illusion of biology and this and that and the other .
but what happens with application is everything get sucked into the application .
and the pure stuff it is the pure mathematics .
there is not any pure mathematics to speak .
it is all application at mathematics .
and i i failed to make sure that this pure area wa wa maintained and and and developed .
and i think now one of the thing i i want to try to do and and it is a funny thing because i am used to look ive been a tech ceo from more than half my life now .
this is what i know how to do .
and i can i can make stuff happen and get project to happen even a it turn out basic science project in that setting and and how that translates into there are a lot of people working on for example our physic project distributed through the academic world .
and thats working great .
but the question is can we have a accelerated to mechanism that make use of what weve learnt in our rd innovation ?
and but on the other hand it is a funny thing because in a company in the end the thing is it is a company .
it make product it is solving cell thing to people .
when you are doing basic research one of the challenge is there is not that same mechanism .
and thats the challenge when you have the economics of the world are such that when you are delivering a product people say thats useful .
well buy it .
and then that feed back in then you can then you can pay the people who build it to eat they can eat and on .
and with basic science the the payoff is very much le visible .
and and with this physic project a i say the big surprise ha been that for example the big surprise with the physic project is that it is look it ha nearterm application .
and i wa i am guessing this is two hundred year away .
it is it is i wa using the analogy of of newton starting a satellite launch company which would have been wrong time .
and but but it turn out thats not the case but we can not guarantee that .
and if you say we are signing up to do basic research basic allogy let say and and we can not we do not know the horizon it is an unknown horizon .
it is an undecidable proposition of when is this proof going to end to speak when is it going to be something that that that they get supplied ?
i i hope this is this becomes a vibrant new field of allogy .
i told you many many time it is one of the most amazing idea that ha been brought to this world .
i hope you get a bunch of people to explore this world .
thank you once again for spending your valuable title in me today .
thank you .
thanks for listening to this conversation with stephen wolfram .

and now let me leave you some word from richard feynman .
nature us only the longest thread to weave her pattern .
each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry .
thank you for listening and hope to see you next time .
welcome to the in early podcast where i speak to those at the forefront of the digital asset and technology sector telling reallife story considering the growth and growing pain of the industry and exploring how blockchain and other technology ha made an impact on people life .
my name is matt green and i head up blockchain digital asset and technology dispute at law firm lauren stevens .
this week i speak to professor sarah green who finished a fouryear tenure a the law commissioner for commercial and common law predominantly dealing with all thing digital including drafting various iteration of the law commission paper on digital asset .
we speak about the journey of crypto asset becoming property of common law and why that wa important to where we are now with legislation looking to define thing a property using a negative definition proposed by the judiciary .
sarah is now the head of digital asset and trade finance at d2 legal technology and a professor of law at bristol university .
i hope you enjoy this episode .
hi it is nice to be here .
thanks very much .
your about page on linkedin is absolutely not messing around .
it say and i quote professor sarah green wa law commissioner for common and common and commercial law at the law commission of england and wale from two thousand and twenty to two thousand and twenty four .
during that time her law reform work included the electronic trade document act two thousand and twenty three advice to the government on smart contract updating the arbitration act of one thousand nine hundred and ninety six scoping reform to the law of intermediated security did i say that ?
yeah about and drafting guidance and a bill to ensure that english law is suited to accommodate digital asset .
hopefully i got most of that .
in short how did you get to that point in your life where you are doing all these thing ?
a an academic most of those thing i had written about for the best part of twenty year which is pretty scary looking back on it now .
but i started life a a software developer at accenture and then went back to law did a law degree went to accenture then went back to law .
i had a natural interest in the way that the law interacts with technology .
id been writing for a while about how the law wa going to have to change or i thought the law wa going to have to change to accommodate technological development .
and then at about the same time the law commission and the government were looking for people to talk about that and to make law reform along those line .
and the job came up at the time .
there are not that many private lawyer who were interested in the technology side of thing .
they tended to want to ignore it .
i got the job and it wa a dream job at a dream time because it wa two thousand and twenty .
it made that a lot easier .
it wa a silver lining to the whole case .
it wa an easier sell .
it wa a much easier sell .
it wa a much easier sell .
yeah much easier .
and for the sake of those who do not know and again i always mentioned my dad on this but for the sake of maybe my dad let run through a couple of those or a few .
can you summarize what work you did on the electronic trade document act two thousand and twenty three for starter ?
yeah absolutely .
that is my baby .
thats the thing that ive been .
your face is lit up .
yeah it is something that ive been writing about since two thousand and five i think .
this is a long a long a long project .
because it became clear to me a i said with my technological background i realized that the law a it stood wasnt going to be able to accommodate what commercial party wanted to start using which is electronic document .
now i know people will be thinking everybody us electronic document .
i send pdfs all the time .
we do not whats the big legal first ?
but the point is and this is the boring lawyer lord bitwell is not boring to me but it is absolutely essential to understand why we needed that act is that legally there are certain document that had before that act to be in physical form .
why is that ?
because the law required them to be held and transferred and possessed in order to work .
you get these document when you sell good .
there these document for instance called bill of lading which are document which represent for instance good on a ship .
and if youve got that document in your hand it is incredibly valuable because there is a legal alchemy that occurs which give you by virtue of holding the document you thereby have to the good which is of course huge commercially .
but that explains why those document had to be in physical form before because they had to be possessed and held and transferred .
to be able to wave it around at that point .
and that when i have it and give it to you i no longer have it and you have it and you have sole control of it and you have the sole copy you have the legally relevant sole copy of it .
and you couldnt do that in digital form .
the law wouldnt allow it .
party wanted to use for obvious reason electronic bill of lading because with paper you have to get that piece of paper from maybe i am a seller in new zealand and you are the buyer and you are over here in england .
youd have to wait for that physical paper document to get from one side of the planet to the other which is of course in two thousand and twenty three absolutely crazy .
the electronic trade document act all six substantive section of it is about making legal equivalent between paper document and electronic document that fulfill certain criterion .
thats the important thing because those electronic document have to be able to do what you and i have said .
you have to have a singular copy ha to be fully transferable that when i get rid of it you do not want multiple copy around .
it is the double spend problem .
i do not want to give you to those good and give it to ten other people .
whether you are in the music industry when people were copying music thats where were you then ?
the technology is only quite recently able to do that .
thats what that act doe .
i am going to move on a little bit because i am interested in that but i am aware that we have many question to get through .
but let have a quick chat about your government advice on smart contract .
what were some of the work that you did there ?
smart contract were obviously when we started this project in two thousand and twenty they were fairly nascent and in fact a lot of contract lawyer did not to think about them at all .
but i think now that they are quite mainstream .
and when we started that project we did it with a view to maybe reforming the law of contract that it could deal with smart contract .
we realized that contract law wasnt a problem .
the rule of contract law a they stand and a they have stood for century are absolutely fine .
it is not the rule that needed to change .
it is the way in which those rule are applied in electronic and digital form .
for instance very for a contract you need an offer you need an acceptance thats trite law you need some other thing a . let stick to offer an acceptance .
and the thing is of course you can have an offer and acceptance you are still going to need that with a smart contract .
it might look a bit different because it will not be me saying to you matt do you want to buy my oat for whatever fifty pound of turnip whatever .
thats your example .
yeah because thats what the contract case are about .
there are about oat on the sea .
but for smart contract it would be software id programmed for instance interacting with software you had programmed .
but i would have programmed it to make an offer and you would have programmed it to accept on certain term .
the rule and the legal shape of that agreement is exactly the same .
it wa then we realized it wa about educating lawyer to apply the old rule to the new system .
it wa almost about putting the old rule onto a new mechanism that wa digitized .
yeah absolutely .
and now let turn to where our path cross broadly ?
which is the treatment of digital asset ?
i do sesticola that wasnt me .
i thought it wa you .
your name wa on it .
i wa an observer on it but i can not claim credit .
a lot of the work wa done before i wa on board but you are i am now on uk dc and i did do comment on that .
when i wa googling it i swear it said something i saw your name on it somewhere .
i did contribute but i can not claim that that wa my work a i am saying .
we had the legal statement and we had the legal statement on crypto asset and smart contract which concluded that they should be in theory no bar to crypto asset being property at law .
and for smart contract to be legally binding all the way back in two thousand and nineteen to which you were i think i put here specialist consulting .
can you tell u broadly what property is and why digital asset did not fit into any of those ?
and i have i should have warned you before the podcast .
i put some definition on if thats helpful to refer to .
why is property an issue in term of digital asset ?
it is ... the electronic trade document that ive talked about a subset of this and we would have done them all together if resource had led .
the problem with digital asset is that for a very very long time english law and to some extent i should say still doe .
it divided personal property .
personal property is everything that is not your land or thing building and land .
divided that into two category known a thing in action and thing in possession .
and those category were regarded a completely exhausted that if you did not get a thing in one of those two category it couldnt be the subject of or the object i should say of property right .
can we put an example in ?
if it wa something tangible rather than thats possession or chose a a a contractual to do something ?
if there are example of those two .
thats important distinction .
thing in possession or yeah historically show in possession are everything that you would imagine .
your watch or your laptop or if you look at the historical case bag of gold thing that you can touch .
and again to go back to the thing we said about document thing that i can hold i can pas on to you .
it is very obviously a transfer .
and thats thing in possession .
thats fine .
now thing in action are complete intangible .
thing the obvious one is a debt .
everybody know what a debt is i think .
and the point about those pure intangible is that they do not have this existence in the world a piece of paper or a watch .
all that they are are creature of the legal system .
they only exist in far a youve got people who claim them and a legal system that recognizes them .
they are hugely important but there is a massive difference between those and thing in possession .
historically the law said it is one or the other .
and then of course digital asset come along and they are i think they are much closer to thing in possession because i can have say an nft to be generic and quite futureproof ?
some nonfungible token whatever it amount to that ha an existence in the world .
it is not a debt because if you or i did not claim it nobody claimed it and a legal system chose not to recognize it it would still be there .
it exists outside of the legal system .
it exists objectively .
but you would think yeah thing in possession which i think personally i think that would do .
but i can understand why there wa difficulty with people accepting that it wa a perfect thing in possession because for instance some of them are transferred in different way .
if i give you my watch what leaf my hand is exactly what arrives in your hand .
and of course with some digital asset thats not the case .
they might be extinguished and transferred and recreated in say your wallet .
there are lot of reason why they are not quite thing in possession but they are definitely not thing in action i do not think .
that wa the law commission report because they have this subjective existence that youve pointed out .
that wa the problem .
but people are investing all this money in digital asset .
and the question a i said to some extent is still open .
is there property in that going to be protected ?
and that ha not been clear at all .
that wa the focus of my work on digital asset .
and what doe declaring something property give an individual ?
if you have a property it mean that you have it is protected against the world that if somebody take it away from you interferes with your possession this is why it matter what the nature of it then you have legal remedy .
ive heard people say you can get your thing back .
the peculiarity of english law is you do not necessarily need that but you could get you might get the thing back .
but it is a judicial discretion but you would certainly have your protected in another way .
say youd get damage that amount to the market value of that thing .
but it is about protecting it against third party interference .
and without property you do not have that .
yeah i think it is about having a almost a title to something but it also give confidence in that asset to a wider market ?
because if something is declared a property or treated a property then there is a sense that a market will treat it differently because there is an ownership status .
thats how i saw it .
and very importantly in situation of insolvency nobody like to think about this because they do not imagine they are going to be insolvent .
whereas if all i have is a contractual do not have a property ive given it to you and we have a contract you are looking after it .
ill be an unsecured creditor which mean i rank far lower when the asset are being distributed .
and thats bad news .
a property give you a strong claim a much stronger claim than you might otherwise have .
now end quote and that wa two thousand and nineteen and when i think about where we are now i would question the decentralization part mainly because i do not feel there always a need to be decentralized .
you have crypto asset tether and usdc where there is clearly a centralized entity behind it .
i appreciate this wa in two thousand and nineteen but do you agree with my observation ?
do you have any observation on any of those five point ?
is that still correct or do you think weve moved on ?
no i think weve moved on .
what we the difference between the ukjt and the law commission is that the ukjt is there to state .
a the name suggests it wa a statement of the law whereas of course the law commission ha grace power and that it change the law .
that they are doing slightly different thing .
and what we realized that the law commission is that we i think for digital asset to identify that subset that can then be the object of property right you need to be a bit finer grained and you need to be a bit more discerning .
what we did is we went to what we thought were the the purest rawrst principle of a digital asset .
and it doe overlap with what youve read from the ukjt statement .
but a i said it is it is it is not narrower and we have moved on .
and what we said wa independence which is of course what weve talked about already several time because thats super important .
something ha an objective existence in the world .
and then a word which i am not wild about .
but we could never think of a better one .
and we asked load of consultees and neither could they which is rivalrousness which is simply that if i am if i if i have something if i am enjoying something a a piece of property that you can not do at the same time get it .
it is exclusive use of it .
i am going to come on to all of it .
all . . thats .
yeah i think weve moved on to those two thing .
yeah i think thats broadly .
looking at it wa it wa quite nice reading those those criterion .
but it seems weve moved on .
now through a crypto monday event organized by brian mundo i met dr. keir finlowbates who in turn spoke very knowledgeably about the fundamental of blockchain .
one thing he hadnt realized wa the issue around crypto asset being property a weve discussed .
and i explained to him the issue around defining property at law thing that are tangible and right that are not thing that you have a contract to write to .
and that pre two thousand and nineteen ha hadnt been considered .
he thought it wa a bit weird .
i talked him through the task force paper with the disgust and walked him through the case of any person unknown which i wa a part of .
and in that case an insurer sort a proprietary injunction over bitcoin a a ransom paid .
and the court had to grapple with could crypto asset fall under a proprietary injunction on the base that is it property .
it wa the first time crypto asset at law had been regarded a property in common law .
and it wa a huge effort from the barrister at the time and the wider team .
but yeah darrell connell did a great job .
and in your view then why hadnt this issue around crypto asset being property been considered pre two thousand and nineteen when bitcoin let say wa wa broadly released a decade before ?
i think there a couple of thing .
i think the simplest explanation is that bitcoin wa obviously bitcoin obviously get a a bad press i think generally and people roll their eye and it is seen a a very unfair is thing .
but and it can be of course but then can cash .
come the internet .
but what it ha done is it ha spawned much else .
and it is in term of distributed ledger technology in term of getting around the double spam program in digital form .
thats all great .
but of course what it what it did come from wa wa an anarchic source .
and the the original ethos to it wa we do not need we can do this without intermediary .
we do not need court .
we do not need legal advisor code is law all that stuff .
i think that probably for a while .
and of course thats i am not saying this a a lawyer i am saying this a a human stating fact of course that is fine a long a party are happy for it to be resolved in that way .
but of course a is inevitable all of these thing once they spread into the mainstream it is difficult to think of it not being mainstream now but it wasnt then .
and i think it wa the the the availability heuristic of litigation if you that it took that long for a dispute that party wanted intervention with to get to get to court .
i think it is that boring an explanation .
i guess it took ten year from it release to being widely adopted to being worth litigating over .
it is a short period of time .
it is increasing is not it ?
when we started this project in two thousand and twenty these project i should say a lot of what we were talking about felt very speculative .
people did not know a lot of people did not know especially lawyer did not know what it wa we were talking about .
he fast forward even two and a half year .
most of our audience had an idea what we were talking about .
and a there ha now been a suite of common law decision after a that wa that wa what i suppose you could say started or but there been load of judicial decision making now .
it doe feel a bit a snowball effect which is no bad thing in term of sorting out what the right are .
yeah it is been great .
i think our jurisdiction ha been leading the way with this stuff .
to turn paragraph fifty nine of that judgment a person unknown the judge note with reference to the statement on crypto asset and smart contract .
and i quote the conclusion wa expressed .
the conclusion wa expressed wa that a crypto asset might not be a thing in action on a narrow definition of that term .
but that doe not mean that it can not be treated a property .
essentially and for the reason identified in that legal statement i consider that a crypto asset such a bitcoin are property end quote .
at this moment crypto asset were property albeit at common law .
i suppose the law commission saw this and thought we need to do some future proofing and consider it broadly .
wa that the the modus operandi for the law commission ?
i think we wanted to bring some clarity to the law because of course that the problem with common law development which we talked about which is great in the sense that it is very responsive .
and it is a lot more agile obviously than statute or whats the person in statute take year and year to change it if indeed you can .
but of course the downside to leaving it to develop through common law through case law is again you have to wait for the case to come up .
and of course what you then have a most of the time and i think this ha played out and it is fairly true for all the case we have had is the question get asked in small part .
of course in a a it wa about could it be the subject of an injunction ?
and then you have can it be do you have a fiduciary duty in relation to all these all these question separate legal question .
whereas we spoke to judge and we spoke to to legal advisor .
and we got the impression that what would be helpful is is a bringing together of all of those question and all of those issue into one document that we could deal with them all a a coherent whole .
and i can not quite remember the time frame now .
i think that wed already decided that before aa wa wa handed down .
but the aim wa very much to bring all of those issue together and to decide them a a a a coherent whole which of course is something that judge can not do because they have to deal with the question .
let move through through this chronologically then there wa the law commission digital asset call to evidence .
can you tell u i suppose you your view already answered my first question .
why wa that set up ?
but secondly who responded ?
and what wa some of your favorite or least favorite feedback ?
who responded broad a i said and that and thats great .
thats what we wanted .
we listen technically absolutely anybody can respond .
and their name appears i think in the back of it .
yeah yeah everybody .
yeah it is great .
it tended to be with digital asset it tended to be either end user or technology of some form whether they were platform developer service provider their legal counsel and academic who were interested judge think that probably cover the most of the broad basis .
those were all the bit we got a huge amount of input from legal counsel .
and which wa brilliant because we kept being told you are you are you are you are looking for a problem .
is that what they said ?
ive heard a lot of people load of people told u that .
and then before this people would say to me you are doing this project and it is only because it is hyped and wa a hope for a reason ?
but even when you go on linkedin anybody that touch any of this is always excited about it and promoting it .
yeah and there were real client with real problem arising from this .
what wa some call for evidence ?
that i think that answer the question about what wa my favorite it wa the the strong yes we are glad you are doing this because these are question that we have been asked for a while now .
and of course it is hard to give legal advice when youve got no frame of reference .
and you have very little litigation and there the statute need interpreting and it is not at all clear .
i could i could understand why legal advisor felt they needed this .
that that i think wa my favorite part of the initial response which wa we are not doing something thats science fiction and space age and i have had all these thing quoted at me .
and thats and thats my least favorite thing wa still a few people saying needle criticism .
yeah this is the law commission wasting time when there are other area of law that need reform there always area of law that need reform but yeah that wa my least favorite. . and it is still going .
it seems surprising that therell be such a pushback to say that this is a waste of time .
but anyway i do that wa proved wrong .
you were proved .
and next in the chronology wa the digital asset consultation paper published 28th of july two thousand and twenty two which included the law commissioner thought on our thought following the assimilation of opinion provided under the call for evidence .
and three is rivalrous and quote to use your favorite word .
and now the first of these three limb seems to my mind relatively straightforward .
but there were a few point that i thought wa worth flushing out the podcast .
there is a statement within when i read it which wa an excellent footnote which read a follows and i quote wa we consider that all tangible thing have been have an informational attribute to them .
we do not consider them to be composed of data represented in an electronic medium in any normal sense .
end quote the footnote read this would come close to a fantasy or matrix s environment where all thing were simply treated a being composed of information .
see the matrix one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine end quote .
why wa this something that wa included ?
did you feel they are extreme pedant at play ?
i know you have to go to the extreme to figure out what the boundary are .
but i laughed when i read this .
is that how far you needed to go ?
this is an argument that weve had .
weve heard i heard for year when i wa writing about this stuff academically and ha persisted albeit generally from from from one source and from one support .
one source not not one individual but it is it is quite a strong academic argument ?
everything is data .
thats all we are talking about when we talk about digital asset is information .
and for anyone who listening to this to whom it is not clear there is and it is and it is absolutely correct that there is a legal rule that you can not have a property in pure information .
and there a famous case somebody stole an exam paper back in the day when they were all in paper and and copied down the question or you do not remember the question .
i can not remember the exact fact but got the question ?
then put the paper back .
and there wa a big question about had he stolen that that information .
and it wa no you can not steal information because it is purely intangible .
you can not carry it away .
obviously if ive got information in my brain i tell you this information but it doesnt remove it from my brain .
that there no independence of the sort that weve talked about .
there wa a common objection to what we were trying to do with digital asset which wa that information and you can not have property and information which a i said i think is .
we have been at pain to point out why they are far more than information because they are information instantiated in this independent .
i think it is physical but i do not think it matter whether you think it is physical or not .
it is this independent form in the world .
i memorize the serial number on all the note in your wallet .
and obviously i then do not get the transactional spending power of those note simply by knowing the serial .
i need that note and i need to pas that note over .
it ha to be instantiated in that form .
and exactly the same is true of say a bitcoin ill use a bitcoin because it is the thing that most people have heard of .
if you take a virtual currency that is in essence if you put it in human readable form it is a string of alphanumeric code ?
again i could memorize or write down or whatever .
the alphanumeric code belong all the alphanumeric code belong into some crypto whale .
but i still wouldnt be rich .
i wouldnt be any richer than i wa before i did that because knowing that pure information is not the same a having the digital asset .
it is not information it is information instantiated within a system .
then you can not have proprietary right over property ?
over information .
over information .
sorry i completely screwed that question up .
what i meant to say wa you can not have proprietary right over data slash information .
if it is pure information .
if i tell you an idea then you are going to do it .
and again then all of a sudden you have database right copyright .
you have intellectual property which is a completely different thing .
but the whole reason why the law ha intellectual property is that you can not have normal property right in pure information or in a design or in an idea .
the law created this whole new statutory intellectual property right which gave you the ability to an extent to protect your idea .
but that doesnt exist normally at law which is exactly why statute had to emerge to protect it .
and a lot of people again in the early day said to me and to some extent still do but why can not you do it through intellectual property ?
but the two thing are very different .
and when you buy again ill use an nft for the sake of being generic .
when you buy an nft you do not necessarily you can but you do not necessarily want it .
because you want you do not want the intellectual property right you do not want to have it a your your thing commercially to exploit .
you want it because you want the border .
i know i am standing this is outdated now is not it ?
but you want the the artwork or whatever it represents you want the thing you want the use value .
and and the thing is when we buy tangible thing book and back in the day if you bought a dvd you knew you werent buying the intellectual property and you did not want the intellectual property .
and for some reason when it come to digital form people merge the two and they can not see that yes you can have intellectual property and digital asset .
but you can also have the use value which is what you want .
and this to the and again we could talk about that for a long time but that doe ask the matrix question what do you think about that ?
but certainly a to the second limb about the data object existing outside of the legal system existing independently from person or the legal system .
can you explain that thinking on why thats vital ?
yeah it go back to that piece of paper thing we said at the start it is about partly about the double spend problem .
it is about recognizing that now technology can emulate in digital form what weve always taken for granted in term of possessibility .
yes we all use those .
but the beauty of a word document is that it is not singular .
and you want to be able to present it .
yeah you want to be able to share it .
but when it is a bitcoin you do not you want that to be yours or a fraction of a bitcoin whatever .
thing that shouldnt fall into the category .
yeah those in disha i think we called them in that paper .
they are characteristic .
anyway those characteristic .
they are criterion i think .
those criterion were our attempt to identify and crystallize what it is about conventional tangible asset that make them the proper objective property right and how they therefore differ from the thing we talked about earlier in tangible right debt .
we were trying to isolate the physical characteristic that separated those two thing .
and the last point on that criterion that ive had before wa this whole idea about rivalrousness .
the example given at paragraph five spot four eight wa and i quote wa mackinbury in charge of this part .
and i quote this mean the thing in question must be something whose capacity for use is not limited .
people must therefore complete must compete with one one another for it .
more formally a resource is rivalrous if use of the resource by another person necessitate necessarily it is not easy to say this prejudice the ability of others to make equivalent use of the same thing .
this is why i think this wa mapped for sure .
for example if alice us a game boy to play her pokemon red game bob can not use the same game boy at the same time .
alices use of the game boy prejudice bob ability to use it .
my question here wa why wa this provision included ?
and i think the answer is youve already come up with is that you want an exclusivity to these these piece of property ?
thats the point .
you can not have it is almost an mp3 back in the day where people copy paste and all of a sudden everybodys got a copy of this song ?
it ha to be a level of rivalrousness .
i guess there nothing more to add on that point .
no i do not think .
it is about if it is if if if something is not rivalrous you probably do not most of the time need a want it protected anyway .
yeah yeah i suppose .
all of these proposition relate to digital asset which includes digital file and record email account and in game asset i think wa also included in this paper .
the main name and of course crypto token .
doe this mean then that prior to this paper or prior to at least some good thought on this topic that an mp3 file wasnt property ?
yeah probably .
what we were very clear about .
this wa where we had some of the most interesting disagreement i think .
we had a few round table where we discussed pretty much the list that youve read out there .
what we decided would be the best way to proceed .
and again this link to what ive said about not wanting to make intangible in general that the objective of these property right is we did not want to isolate specific category and say all mp3s or all digital file or all database will or will not be .
because again we do not know how those thing are going to develop in the near future .
and we did not want to prejudge i suppose what they would look .
the short answer to your question is i think yes .
and the way we wanted to get around that wa to produce these characteristic that people would at least have a frame of reference in the future to hold their thing up against and decide whether or not they would have property right in it .
and obviously you are most likely to do that through a legal advisor but the point remains .
and also it depends a lot on context because of course there is i am saying of course because ive encountered it much maybe listener will not be quite familiar with it but ive certainly encountered a lot of homogenization of digital asset .
a loss of it is about function and context .
and you can have nfts that are rivalrous and independent there might be another situation where they are designed not to be .
what we said wa we are not going to refer to these separate category of thing we are going to stick to characteristic .
and a long a something exhibit those characteristic it doesnt matter what it is called it doesnt matter what category it go in it can be the object of property right .
and then this move u to the next paper .
after that there wa the law commission digital asset final report 28th of june two thousand and twenty three .
i hope ive got that .
yeah yeah it is been a long time .
it wa thirty year .
which broadly follows the proposal laid out in it predecessor except those three criterion became indicia .
thats thats true .
however one limb which read and that wa the first one composed of data you got rid of the composed of data there .
ill read out the quote to make it easy is composed of data represented in electronic medium including in the form of computer code electronic digital or analog signal .
why did you get rid of the composed of data bit ?
that wa the result of consultation .
this is a nice example of how law commission consultation are genuine consultation .
we we quite often change change our mind .
when we speak to all the all the people ive mentioned before in user and legal advisor on .
there were two reason for that .
i never liked it anyway i have to say personally i never thought that we needed to restrict it to data object because i thought that the independence and rival rest with it with a real key to identifying those thing that need these proprietary protection .
i am talking factually not legally .
factually i can take your car i can take your watch i can take your thing away from you if you do not even if you do not want me to .
can not do that with a debt .
i can not i can not take your right away from you .
i can infringe them but i do not remove them from you .
you still get them you still get to keep them .
digital asset the sort of digital asset that can be the object of property right need to be those that can be involuntarily alienated which is why they arrive or u why we care that we want them back .
and i thought that independence and rivalryness were the only thing we needed to make that identification .
and then when we were speaking in consultation with various group for instance they brought the same thing to our attention .
for instance there were people who talked to u about voluntary carbon credit .
i saw that and thought that wa a bit of a left field thing to include but i wouldnt have thought about it .
it is a good thing to include .
yeah good thing to include and potentially massive and obviously growing .
these are credit by which you can offset your carbon contribution .
they are obviously very valuable .
they are tradable .
i think they are the thing that sits closest to the border of our criterion .
but we saw no reason particularly once we were presented with the argument from those who thought that vcc should be the object of property right .
and there are case there is at least one case where they are involuntarily alienated .
i can not think of a snappy way to say it .
you are doing a better job than me where it is taking these hard word .
yeah we got rid of the first limb .
and i personally think it is much better than that .
one point that run through this paper is the recommendation to let common law develop the jurisprudence in the area .
not to legislate but allow the court to figure this out a and when those question arise .
surely this approach put extra pressure on judge .
it mean the only way these issue are determined is where number one there is a dispute between party and two where there are people who are wealthy enough to pay lawyer to figure it out which is on the most part rare .
ive had personal experience that have been interesting .
but people do not want to spend money finding out whats academically interesting .
they want their right they want their property whatever it may be .
i appreciate that we are now a we sit here today at a legislative level .
but given that this wa last year and that the general sense of thing wa that it should be common law led how do you marry this up with the resulting proposition ?
the resulting proposition you mean the bill ?
this is this is another interesting insight into law commission process .
for the reason that weve already talked about in this podcast we thought common law wa far better suited because it can be more responsive .
you can future proof the whole thing because a soon a you start saying in statutory form what is a digital asset ?
is that a date before youve started ? ?
yeah yeah exactly .
and we thought a thats incredibly difficult .
some jurisdiction in the world have tried it .
and those the resulting statute have run to thousand and thousand of provision .
and of course once you start doing that there are more hostage to fortune .
a lot of people usually non lawyer think that a statute equal le uncertainty .
of course one to a lawyer .
and thats not strictly true .
the the court still have to interpret them .
we thought common law is the best way to do it .
and common law ha dealt with property for century that what we wanted to do wa sneak digital asset probably shouldnt say sneak because that make u out of the hand .
we thought we should key digital asset into the development of the common law and let the common law do it magic .
but the whole point of our final report that you referred to wa that we wanted to be able to because it is absolutely a bit of a what could be seen a the page passing the book to judge .
and it is a big job for them .
what we said is well do this final report that will provide the analytical framework that judge can refer to you .
and thankfully it ha been used in that way .
but the interesting thing wa we had this round table with judge a we do with all of these thing .
and obviously we clearly wanted to bring to their attention the fact that we were about to go there you are because all over joy you go go and read this .
and they said we did suggest it but we did not think theyd go for it .
and they said thats all they need to open it up .
because this is a very big legal step to go from those two category that have been there for century .
and they said theyd find it helpful .
weve got that little bill which wa introduced to parliament two week ago because the judge asked for it .
they were quite happy to develop the common law alongside our guideline .
and i should make it clear they are absolutely guideline .
we are of course not telling the judiciary what to do we couldnt do that .
but they needed that little bit of the door kicked open slightly that they could then make law .
yeah it wa always permission .
and thats it i guess it is that open door to give them the ability to go and create law in the way that you anticipate .
the latest report and i suppose the final report published twenty two july two thousand and twenty four and wa a supplemental report and a draft bill for parliament a weve spoken about .
a short note i put in my note here then in the previous paper the three criterion then became indicia i can not say it indicia indicia i do not think ive ever had to say it loud before indicia .
it did not mean that each of them had to be followed by the stringoleta do it wa something that wa proposed .
and i understand that there some future proofing here ive used that term throughout this recording with you .
and it is not to limit the definition of thing which exist now but to a i say future proof thing going forward .
is there anything that is on the horizon already that youve seen that youve thought i am glad we left this negative definition open or are we still in a period whereby we are waiting for these new digital asset to exist ?
i think there there no discrete category that that i can think of at the moment maybe thats not surprising given that we are le than a year down the road .
but what i would say is there are two thing vccs that weve already mentioned they are voluntary carbon credit they are evolving their form is evolving .
and what ive seen even since the report not the supplemental on the one before that is the massive increase in real world asset tokenization and uptake from major bank most of them .
this is the trendy thing this year is not it ?
it is tokenization of real world asset .
yeah absolutely .
whats next year ?
yeah exactly that .
although we did have those thing in mind when we wrote those recommendation we did not know quite how big they were going to get and how quickly and of course the bigger they get and the more adopted they are the more refined the technology will get .
in fact the draft bill is called the property digital asset etc bill etc .
i thought it wa quite interesting but let not talk about that .
slated for parliament on the 11th of september two thousand and twenty four the word digital and electronic are included only a a reference and i think youve gone through the reason why .
the wording of the bill read and i quote a thing including a thing that is digital or electronic in nature is not prevented from being the object of personal property right merely because it is neither a thing in possession or a thing in choice .
the subject of the bill however is a thing .
is that the word ?
seems a bit obscure a thing .
yes deliberately .
when youve heard me say several time today i am trying to be generic and throughout these project ive tried to be a generic a possible .
personally i am not what i did not get i did not .
you do not have to take credit for the word thing .
no i do not want to take credit for the word thing but youve already drawn attention to the fact that it is called the digital asset etc bill and the first line that say a thing including a digital thing .
i do not think those part were necessary .
the parenthesis the bear word say including a thing that is digital .
if it had been up to me and obviously it wasnt it wa a joint effort and a consultative effort but if it had been up to me i do not think we need digital i do not think you need to put that in .
most of the time it will be digital but it is not it is not unnecessary but thing i think is very important .
is that a word ?
it is now .
i certainly can not take credit for that .
there a lot of property literature on that and there a guy called henry smith who writes about thingness and thingness is what weve tried to do there with independence and rivalryness .
it is to crystallize and identify what it is about stuff that make it the appropriate object of property right .
the thing weve talked about full divestibility on transfer being able to hold it and when i say hold it i do not necessarily mean with my hand because of course i hold thing in my wallet by other mean .
control control is key to the final report certainly .
once i can control something it is likely to be seen and i hope it will be seen by the law a a thing and i can only control thing .
yes deliberately generic because i think all that is necessary are those characteristic and whatever in the future might fall within those characteristic .
there no obvious reason to me and i am going to leave it in the negative way .
there no obvious reason to me why it shouldnt be an object of property right but that negative thing wa suggested to u by the judge the negative phrasing it is a challenge .
but i think thats important because what we are saying is again we are not telling the court or parliament i should say .
parliament will not be telling the court you must say these thing are object of property right .
what they are saying is there no reason not to .
if the fact are and you feel in this case it is that aa if you feel that there no reason why it shouldnt have a proprietary injunction then feel free to do it .
but there no mandate there no every time a digital asset fulfills these condition or exhibit these characteristic .
this whole negative definition thing is to give judge comfort that they can make decision without looking silly .
thats exactly it .
silly the word .
without looking unconstitutional i think thats exactly it .
and i suppose it is due to be considered by parliament .
do we know when that is ?
it is been introduced now .
itll be ... probably due to the normally tank .
and if the answer is we do not know we do not know .
it is how long is a piece of string .
it is affected by how long a bill take is affected by all sort of thing .
the electronic trade document act .
yeah my baby wa affected by the death of monarch because parliament dissolve .
we had four law chancellor we had three prime minister we had a couple of general election and every time you have something that parliament dissolve .
you lose the ... you can not even predict on the basis of this .
it is not usually about the substance of the bill or certainly not in the case of these because they are not too controversial .
the short answer is very much we do not know .
i suppose we could say based on current political relative stability it might be quicker than it would have been for ... or it wa for the eetda .
i would be hopeful that it would be within six month but i am ... you are small bit a . i think i read it all out on this .
it is tiny ?
you go ... but it is about getting the time in parliament and ... it is the timetabling is not it ?
yeah it is the timetabling .
i hope it come soon because it itll give confidence even more confidence to the market which is an important thing .
id to talk about your new role a the head of digital asset and trade finance at d2 legal technology because you have now moved on from the law commission .
firstly who are d2 legal technology and what do they do ?
it is a interesting set of consultant .
and i think it is still fair to say they find that very difficult because they ... they use different language and in the case of technologist a different language .
there is a real disconnect often between those two world which is not helpful .
at the law commission we tried to do that .
we had a few very techy lawyer who could do that .
and then once wed done these law reform i felt the job wasnt finished because of course you can change the law and you can make the condition quite conducive for people to adopt new technology .
but that doesnt necessarily mean theyll do it .
there always an implementation difficulty .
what d2lt can do is be that bridge .
but either nobody know what to do with it or nobody notice it .
yeah nobody notice they have to do that .
thats for doing that but sitting in a drawer .
and the people who understand that legal advice are not the people who understand how to implement the process .
thats what we do .
we fill that gap .
and what doe your role entail ?
and how doe your experience a a professor and with the law society help with that role ?
my role at the moment is a lot of learning .
i sit around listening to people thinking i must remember that .
a lot of what ive said which fit in with both of my previous role because obviously a a law professor you have to teach some pretty complicated idea to at least in the first instance people who have no idea whats going on about law .
and you have to do that in quite a short amount of time .
and then fast forward to law commission day .
and it wa even harder because what i wa doing wa trying to sell we had to sell these project to government trying to sell these quite complex lawyer project to people in government who werent lawyer and had about twenty minute .
and we are interested in whats going to look shiny what the minister going to whatll look good in the paper .
and when you are trying to say we want to reform the bill of exchange act one thousand eight hundred and eighty three because and you can see that the blood drain .
you have to develop way of and you can usually do it through money a soon a you start talking big a this could save u two hundred and twenty four billion a year .
there plenty more of a story there .
you have to learn way to get your point across understanding that not everybody is the legal geek that you are .
thats what i am trying to do on this podcast trying to help people understand number one digital asset and tech and law to some extent .
and a question that i sometimes ask nice and broad is what is your view of the future of digital asset ?
i am ive been optimistic all the way through these project ive always said to people we are not looking for problem .
these digital asset are being used more and more and more .
i think it is exponential .
and we are going to encounter more of these issue which i see a a good thing because thats thats the way that you are now our problem .
and that i think ive ive been proved .
i do not mean to stress i wa the only person saying that far from it .
i think we have been proved the people who said that .
and i think they are going from strength to strength .
definitely in the past three year i spent a lot of time on the conference circuit practitioner conference circuit .
and the conversation ive heard over those three year have come on leap and bound in term of real use case a said big bank jpmorgan embracing digital asset using them an awful lot .
it is not we might do this in the future .
it is this .
and of course every time that happens you get then more impetus for developer to make them better .
exponential is why i see the development a . and i am going to ask you a question a final question that i havent included on the piece of paper .
ive thought about it now while i wa listening to you .
is the uk the leader in this ?
or do you feel there somewhere else doing a better job at encouraging the use of digital asset ?
i think we have been a leader in a lot of way .
and certainly in term of private law right which is essentially what ive been talking about today .
i think we are a leader .
we had our law commission work cited in celsius bank cropsey case in the u because the judge there did not have any other thing to refer to .
that wa quite nice that we because thats exactly what we wanted to do .
we werent precious about it .
we wanted to send that out .
i think in term of private law development dubai ha recently done quite a lot of work but based on on what weve done a singapore is always a frontrunner .
they certainly did electronic trade document before we did because they they are a bit more of a nimble equal system and parliamentary system .
and regulation wise i think we are in the middle we havent been incredibly whats the word we havent been incredibly restrictive in the way that the u sec could have been said to be until quite recently a i think weve gone one side .
but equally we havent rolled out the red carpet and we were never going to do that it is not a very english jurisdictional thing to do .
and i think at the moment we are waiting and seeing which is not a terrible thing because i do not think there necessarily a first mover advantage .
in regulation i think it is a bit more of a wait and see but i am quite pleased that i think we have been at the forefront of the other development .
i think weve done a good job in this jurisdiction i think for my world private law being in the high court there been decent amount of precedence .
and when i speak to certainly american lawyer they are always relying on sec type case .
and it is a whole different ball game .
and when i tell them the type of work that i do they seem to be semi flummox that you can do this thing in this jurisdiction .
i think we have an ability to be a little bit more nimble than others .
but my sense of regulation is is that we havent been particularly knee jerk but we have been maybe too patient .
but i think that agrees .
no i think we are being too patient .
i think it is about time now that but i say that and that there are there are thing being done .
it is not a if at all .
no they are absolutely not sitting on their hand .
no and it is better not to rush into these thing .
and you do need to get the private law sorted before you can do the regulation .
because of course you do not know what you regulate .
you do not know what the link .
i think i think it will be fired again this optimist in me .
and i know that for instance the fca is definitely on it .

thanks for watching .
there this narrative lm replacing job replacing program and particular .
especially in term of threetocan student ill say even if you want to get into ai there always a value in having good software fundamental software engineering fundamental programming fundamental understanding foundation of ai which include thing probability and statistic .
i have a picture pinned to my wall image you and me laughing loving it all .
but look at our life now all tired and torn .
weve mustnt fight and delight in the tear that will not cry and feel done .
all be now .
welcome back to the free code camp podcast .
i am quincy larsen teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org .
each week we are bringing you insight from developer founder and ambitious people getting into tech .
and this week we are talking with efon my a senior software engineer on google tensorflow team who left the private sector behind to go to ai research at stanford .
efon is currently lead maintainer of the open source helm project where he benchmark the performance of large language model .
efon welcome to the show .
thanks much for having me quincy .
it is all good to be here .
yeah and i am hyped to have you here because you have the benefit of having worked in the private sector a a software engineer and now also a a researcher at stanford .
you work a a doing hardcore software engineering on google tensorflow team .
and now you are working doing hardcore cutting edge research with these emerging model and figuring out how good they are .
and thats super super exciting to me .
yeah i am glad to be talking about this stuff .
yeah and ill give the audience some perspective on how you and i met .
i went to this event in singapore or it wasnt in singapore but it wa it might a a i thought it wa ton of singaporean in san francisco .
and of course you grew up in singapore ?
yes i grew up in singapore .
i moved here in the two thousand and ten .
ive been in the bay of san francisco bay of f about fourteen year now .
yeah and youve made good use of time .
and youve been working a an international student or how did you get here ?
yeah i wa originally i grew up in singapore .
i did most of my schooling in singapore .
and thats when i came here .
and i stayed here .
i stayed on after that and kept working here .
and thats where .
and then i did my undergrad in massachusetts at stanford .
and now i working at stanford .
i to joke it is a bit moving back at the parent house .
yeah but it is ive been enjoying being the baby .
and is it common for someone to leave ?
because people leave academia all the time for the eye paying fancy job cushy job in silicon valley in new york city place that .
but is it common for someone to leave that life behind ?
volunteerally sit down the tool and go do something almost completely different .
doing research is very different from applying tool .
or maybe you are doing a lot of research while you are at google in addition to being a software engineer .
but is that a common career progression ?
or would you say thats relatively uncommon ?
yeah good question .
it is id say it is quite different because the the academia track and in particular .
i friend who have transitioned in both direction .
i friend who did a phd in academia and published these doing research and then coming back to engineering in industry .
and i also friend that have done engineering in industry and the site i am going to go and do research and go back to academia and do a phd .
and now some of my friend are facting member .
a family industry in all the faculty .
i think the the motivation for doing that there both academia and engineering in the industry are very different career path with very different incentive .
in the u especially academia is a rigid track where i expect it to you have a very fixed career path where you are expected to do a phd and then possibly a post doc in between .
and then have a junior faculty and a senior faculty .
and it is a little this is different from from from from industry and for my friend whove done it the move from engineering in the academia i think a lot of the motivation is do not want to do research they wanted to advance that can feel .
for me the motivation wa a little different because i i am different from from my friend in that i did not go back to academia to do the academic track .
ive i do not have a phd and ive had a phd which is very unusual and yeah you do not have any intention of doing a phd .
i do not which is i am the only person in my lab who not thinking about getting a phd or already ha a phd .
i i saw think of myself more of an engineer because i i building thing .
let a little different from what my friend motivation are because i am not going to be on faculty track ever i am not going to be a professor .
and the way i am thinking about it is instead of my impact being polishing research bleeding research and thinking more of my impact is being a supporter of scientific researcher .
i write software and software and i maintain infrastructure that enables other scientific researcher to do their stuff .
and i think thats thats all a big motivation for me .
i think i enjoyed being close to researcher at google i also had a bit of that because i work on cancer flow and there are machine learning researcher in google and i think thats a a scientific message .
but i might know i feel a lot more closer to the research than advancing than my knowledge at google .
thats interesting .
it is almost a data engineer role where the way i think of data engineer is there team up the data for the data scientist there .
they are there .
you are putting them in position that they can succeed in their mission .
but your skill set and the work you do is a little bit different .
and of course your background is different .
would that be a good one .
i think i think thats exactly .
thats how i think a lot about .
when i once said google i wa working in particular thats building machine learning infrastructure and researcher with research a lot of research is done on tensorflow .
tensorflow is machine learning framework for building model and a lot of research machine learning research is done on that .
my my current job goal is my job position is called research engineer or in some other university because research software engineer .
these are essentially programmer who help help researcher accomplish research either by building infrastructure being software .
wow they were doing this what are they doing this through browser ?
i wa afraid to look it up and it did not exist those diys or whatever metric they are using were not accurate .
wow thats a difficult question .
both interesting .
yeah some of these a used that a the common model is not necessarily decision tree which is if thats the thing .
this is a podcast from techandainews.com .
for more information visit our website .
hey everyone and welcome back .
we are gon na be taking a deep dive today into some pretty amazing ai news .
claude three.fives new ability to use computers. . now this is not ai chatting with u . it is ai getting thing done working with software .
yeah it is pretty incredible .
it is wild .
anthropic the company behind claude three.five is changing the game here .
we are moving away from ai that talk to u and now we are moving towards ai that work with us. . inside the software that we use every day .
what doe that even mean ?
imagine you are working on a spreadsheet ?
and you need to pull some data from a website. . instead of copying and pasting it you could tell claude three.five what you need .
it understands what you are asking it go to the website extract the data and boom it is in your spreadsheet .
hold on that sound something straight out of a movie .
is this for real ?
this is happening now .
and it is not spreadsheet .
think about email calendar even code editor .
this tooling feature this is a pretty big deal .
it is a game changer .
it is huge for developer .
you can automate many task you could have ai help you debug in real time .
it is having an assistant that not only understands you but can carry out your instruction .
in all these different program .
across all sort of application .
this is all thanks to ... this is thanks to some big advancement in natural language processing .
nlp exactly .
you remember those old chat box that we used to have to use ?
you practically had to speak robot to get them to do anything ?
you had to be specific .
it wa ridiculous .
but with claude three.five it is intuitive it understands the nuance of human language .
you could tell it to find me the sale report from last quarter and give me a quick summary .
and itll do it .
no more robotic command .
thats amazing .
it is fantastic .
but how are they managing this ?
how is anthropic ?
are they over promising ?
thats a great question .
a lot of people are wondering that .
but whats interesting about anthropic is that they are committed to experimentation and transparency. . they are constantly testing thing out gathering feedback and refining their model .
they are not here the ai good luck .
and theyve even come out with two new models. ?
yeah each one is designed for a different type of interaction .
haiku and sonnet tell me more about these .
think of them a specialized tool in your ai toolbox .
say you need a quick precise answer .
haiku gon na be the one to go to .
it is super fast .
if i need a quick answer .
but if you are maybe exploring a more complex topic and you need a longer more detailed answer sonnet will give you that richer more comprehensive information .
they are thinking about how people are gon na use this .
yeah they are .
and giving them the tool .
thats pretty smart .
it is and it go back to that idea of them not overpromising . . they are focusing on building ai that solves real problem .
and integrates into our existing workflows. . it is not about replacing human it is about enhancing what we can do .
i that it is augmenting our capability .
this is all very exciting .
but i am curious about how this is all gon na work in practice .
can you give me some specific example ?
how could someone use clod three.five in their daily life ?
let say you are a marketing manager. . you are drowning in email social medium update .
been there. . clod three.five could analyze your inbox prioritize message even draft response for you .
it could even schedule meeting based on your conversation .
it is my personal assistant .
thats incredible .
it could handle all those timeconsuming task .
freeing you up to focus on the bigger picture .
that would be amazing .
strategy creative work all that .
what other example are there other example ?
let say you are planning a trip. . clod three.five could not only book flight and hotel for you but it could also find you hidden gem based on your interest plan out your itinerary .
thats next level vacation planning .
i bet it could be a huge help for student too ?
for research .
all kind of thing .
researching topic summarizing article creating presentation even getting feedback on their writing it is quite remarkable .
the possibility .
they are pretty vast .
this is incredible .
yeah it is about making the ai experience work for you .
this is blowing my mind .
i know it is exciting .
it feel we are on the edge of something huge here .
but i also wonder about the potential downside .
is there a risk that ai becomes too powerful ?
yeah it is a valid concern for sure .
and i think it is important to acknowledge that any technology especially one a powerful a this could be misused .
of course .
but i think whats important to remember is that ai is ultimately a tool ? .
it is all about how we choose to use it .
and that determines the impact that it is going to have .
and thoughtful implementation .
and thats where company anthropic are they setting a good example here ?
i think they are .
i think they are doing a good job .
they are not focused on building the most advanced ai .
they are also putting a lot of thought into ethic and user safety which is important .
can you give me some example of how they are doing that ?
one example is their focus on transparency .
they are very open about how they are developing these model .
they publish research paper .
they are actively engaging with the ai ethic community which is great .
they are not operating in secret. . they are inviting people to look at what they are doing and provide feedback .
yeah absolutely .
and they are also implementing certain safeguard to prevent misuse. . for example they have strict rule about how clawd three.five can access and use your personal data .
thats good to know .
they are taking privacy .
yeah that make me feel a little bit better about all of this .
yeah i think they are trying to strike that balance between innovation and being responsible. . being innovative but also being careful .
and i think thats key to building trust with user and making sure the ai benefit everyone .
yeah i think this whole conversation ha made me realize how important it is to stay informed about all this stuff .
it is .
it is not a tech industry issue .
it is affecting all of u . this is something thats going to touch everyones life .
and i think it is important for u to understand you said to stay informed .
what it can do .
what it can not do .
yes capability it limitation .
yeah how it is going to impact u . exactly .
we have to be aware of all those thing .
it is we need a new type of literacy almost. . ai literacy .
ai literacy .
i love that phrase .
we need to equip ourselves with the knowledge and skill to use ai .
to engage with it in a meaningful way .
weve covered a lot today .
we have .
weve talked about all these amazing thing claude can do .
how it could change how we work how we live .
weve talked about the responsible development and ai literacy .
it is all connected .
whats the one thing you want listener to take away from all of this ?
i think the biggest takeaway is that we are living in a remarkable time .
ai is evolving quickly .
it is .
it is incredible .
and it is up to u to guide it development .
we need to embrace what it can do but also be mindful of the risk .
be aware of the potential downside .
and we need to learn a much a we can .
we need to get those skill that ai literacy that you are talking about .
to navigate this whole new world .
to navigate this new era .
thats a very powerful message .
it is .
it is exciting but also a little scary is not it ?
it is .
it is both .
but i think if we have open mind in we talk about these thing and we agree on some ethical principle i think we can harness the power of ai for good .
that make me feel optimistic .
i do not know about you .
i am optimistic a . you are good .
there are definitely challenge but there also much potential .
it is an amazing time to be alive .
it is .
it is .
to see all of this happening .
it is a technological revolution .
for our listener who want to learn more stay up to date .
where should they go ?
you can always find indepth coverage and analysis at techandainews.com .
it is a fantastic resource for anyone who want to learn more about ai .
it is been a fascinating conversation .
it ha been a pleasure .
yeah absolutely .
yeah i know our listener appreciate your insight .
thank you .
it is not every day you get to talk to an ai expert someone who can explain all this complex stuff in such an understandable way .
i appreciate that i always love talking about ai .
and hopefully get people a little bit more curious about it all .
speaking of curiosity ive got a question thats been on my mind this whole time. . if ai can already work with software this whats next ?
whats the next big thing ?
that is the question is not it ?
it is .
honestly it is hard to say for sure .
thing are changing fast .
what sound science fiction today could be reality tomorrow .
we can not even imagine whats next .
i think thats part of what make it exciting .
it is exciting .
but if i had to guess i think we are going to see ai become even more integrated into our physical world. . we are already starting to see it with smart home selfdriving car .
but i think thats the tip of the iceberg .
instead of working on our computer ai is going to be out there in the world .
yeah interacting with the world around u . imagine ai that can help u get around in complex environment help u with physical task even anticipate what we need before we even know we need it .
that sound amazing but also a little freaky .
it is .
it is a little bit of both .
and thats why these conversation are important .
to be aware of whats happening .
we need to be thinking about these thing talking about them and making sure that ai is developed and used in a way that benefit everyone .
benefit all of u . exactly .
i think it is time to wrap up our deep dive into cloud three.five and it amazing new computer use capability .
to our listener thanks for joining u on this journey .
we hope you learned something new today .
and do not forget to check out techandainews.com for more coverage of all thing ai .
it is a great site yeah .
until next time keep exploring keep learning .
and keep asking those big question .

this is a podcast from techandainews.com .

all let dive into this waspb dependency check. . it is been making some noise in the software world .
youve been looking into this ?
we are hoping you can help u all pull out some of the best insights. . to help everybody ramp up their security .
ive heard it described a a security guard for your code .
thats a great analogy yeah .
always on the lookout. . for any known vulnerability .
yeah it is all about proactively identifying those weakness that could leave your software vulnerable .
yeah you said it is meticulously comparing your code against a massive database of known troublemaker .
it is having a security checklist thats constantly being updated .
with all the latest threat .
and it is checking checking checking .
and whats exciting is that dependency check ha gotten even more powerful lately. ?
yeah theyve supercharged the scanning engine .
it is faster added support for even more programming language .
and made it work seamlessly with other tool .
thats impressive .
but let get down to how good is it at catching vulnerability ?
we all know software security is a constant game of cat and mouse .
you are absolutely . . and when it come to known vulnerabilities. . those with a cveid a digital fingerprint for security flaw ?
dependency check is a rock star .
it is incredibly effective at spotting these common threat .
it can handle the usual suspect in the software world .
it can .
what about those sneaky zero day vulnerability ?
the one that pop up and documented them .
can dependency check handle those too ?
thats where thing get a bit trickier. . because dependency check relies on those database of known vulnerabilities. . it might miss zero day threats. . think of it a security guard with a slightly outdated list of wanted criminal .
some new face might slip through .
that make sense .
it is not a foolproof solution on it own .
yeah exactly .
we can not rely on dependency check and call it a day .
a multilayered security approach is key .
imagine dependency check a your first line of defense. . it is catching those common vulnerability early on. . but you also need thing thorough code reviews. . penetration testing where ethical hacker try to break into your system .
and constant vigilance for new threat to truly lock down your software .
you mentioned penetration testing .
can you give u a quick breakdown of how that work ?
why it is important alongside dependency check ?
penetration testing simulates real world attack to find vulnerability that automated tool might miss .
imagine a team of skilled security expert trying every trick in the book to break into your system .
they are the good guy but they are playing the bad guy .
yeah exactly .
by doing this you can uncover weakness that you did not even know existed .
it is a stress test for your security .
and you can see the limit to see where the crack are .
that sound incredibly valuable .
now how doe this all play out in the world of open source software ? .
a lot of project rely heavily on open source library .
they do .
and which can be a wild card when it come to security. . you do not always know .
it is true .
whats going on in there ?
thats where dependency check shine for a lot of developers. . because open source project are publicly accessible .
it can be prime target for attacker .
it is critical to be extra vigilant about the security of the library you are using .
dependency check help by scanning those libraries. . and flagging any known vulnerability .
giving developer a chance to address potential issue before they snowball into bigger problem .
before they become a real headache .
that could be expensive to fix later .
yeah absolutely .
it is having a dedicated security team constantly monitoring the heartbeat of your open source component .
yeah thats a great way to put it .
but let be realistic. . keeping all our software dependency up to date can feel a never ending game of whackamole .
it definitely can .
but here where dependency check becomes your secret weapon. . it help you stay ahead of the curve. . by identifying outdated library that could be harboring vulnerability .
it is not about reacting to threat .
it is about proactively maintaining a healthy and secure code base .
it is a shift from reactive to proactive .
and dependency check give you the visibility you need to make that happen .
that brings to mind a important point .
weve talked a lot about the technical side of dependency check .
but what about the human element ? .
how do we ensure that developer are using this tool effectively ?
you hit the nail in the head .
technology is only a good a the people using it .
it is about creating a culture of security within development team .
that mean providing the training and resource that developer need to understand security best practice .
including how to use tool dependency check effectively .
it is not about having the tool .
it is about empowering developer to use them responsibly .
it is about making security everyones responsibility .
not something that the security team handle in isolation .
when developer are empowered to contribute to the security of their code thats when real progress .
this reminds me of the equifax data breach back in two thousand and seventeen .
it wa a massive wake up call .
about the importance of software update .
that wa a stark reminder of what can happen when outdated software dependency slip through the crack .
in that case the vulnerability wa in a widely used open source component called apache strut .
and the fix had been available for month before the breach occurred .
it is mind boggling to think that something that could happen .
if they had been using dependency check it might have flagged the issue .
and saved them from a world of pain .
it highlight how crucial regular scan and prompt patching are .
dependency check can be a lifesaver in those situation .
this all circle back to our earlier point about layered security .
penetration check is a fantastic tool. . but it is one piece of the puzzle .
you need a comprehensive approach that includes manual code review penetration testing ongoing security awareness training and a culture that prioritizes security at every step of the development process .
it is about being proactive informed and fostering a security conscious culture within those development team .
now let shift gear for a moment. . weve mainly discussed dependency check from a developer perspective .
but is it relevant for other stakeholder in the software development lifecycle ?
what about project manager security team or even those in leadership role ?
it is absolutely relevant for everyone involved. ?
think of it this way. . project manager can use dependency check insight to understand potential security risk and factor them into timeline and budgets. . it help them plan realistically and allocate resource effectively .
that make sense .
knowing about potential security issue upfront can prevent those lastminute scramble .
and budget blowout .
security team can use dependency check finding to prioritize their work and focus on the most critical vulnerabilities. . it is about working smarter not harder .
it is having a shared understanding of the security landscape .
allowing team to collaborate more effectively. . what about those in leadership role ? .
how can dependency check be relevant to them ?
business leader need to make informed decision about resource allocation and risk mitigation. . dependency check give them the data they need to understand the organization security posture and make strategic decision .
it sound dependency check can be a powerful tool for communication and transparency .
it can .
across the entire software development ecosystem everyones working from the same playbook to speak .
thats a great analogy .
when everyones on the same page about security risk and how they are being addressed it creates a much stronger security posture for the entire organization .
thats a win for everyone involved .
it is. . let bring it all together. . weve covered a lot of ground today .
we have .
and i want to make sure weve distilled the key takeaway about owasp dependency check .
it is a powerful tool for identifying those known vulnerability hiding in your software dependency .
a digital detective sniffing out potential weakness .
it is that proactive approach that make it valuable .
it is not about waiting for a security breach to happen .
it is about actively identifying and addressing those vulnerability before they can be exploited .
and a weve discussed while it excels at catching those known threat it is not a silver bullet for everything .
it is not .
those brand new threat that havent even been documented yet those can still slip through .
thats why it is crucial to integrate dependency check into a broader security strategy. . think of it a one layer in a multilayered defense system. . youve got your manual code review .
youve got your penetration testing .
and that all important security conscious culture all these element work together to create a truly robust security posture .
dependency check is the first line of defense .
catching those common vulnerability early on but we need those additional layer to handle the more complex and evolving threat .
and it is important to remember that the landscape of software security is constantly changing .
new threat emerge all the time .
staying informed about the latest vulnerability and best practice is essential .
what doe this all mean for you our listener ? .
it mean that understanding and effectively using tool oasb dependency check is more critical than ever .
it is not about waiting for a security breach to happen. . it is about taking proactive step to secure your software from the ground up .
and do not be afraid to explore those other security measure weve talked about .
think about integrating penetration testing into your workflow .
dive deep into those code review and cultivate a culture where security is everyones responsibility .
it is all about being proactive informed and building that security first mindset within your development team .
security is a journey not a destination .
there always more to learn new challenge to face .
but by embracing the tool knowledge and practice we can create a more secure digital world for everyone .
it is been a pleasure diving into this topic with you today .

welcome everyone to the consulting technology podcast .
i am john kerr senior producer at cognacore consulting and research .
joined u always by our senior technology researcher dr. samuel z. today guest is dr. sonco park professor at the lundquist college of business at the university of oregon .
son join u on today podcast to discus his research the challenge startup and consultant face in addressing technology adoption and growth in the modern startup ecosystem .
subscribe to this show now for more episode in our consulting technology podcast series .
here is our conversation .
thank you for joining u . i wa wondering if we could start with sharing a bit about your background and how the regional difference in the startup world .
the u south korea or other area of asia the eu ?
i guess ill start with introducing myself a little bit .
yeah i graduated at the university of washington with my phd there in strategic management and technology entrepreneurship .
and afterwards i got a job at the university of oregon currently now a an assistant professor at the college of business .
yeah and i grew up in several different country including korea the u and europe .
and yeah there are very salient difference in term of the entrepreneurial landscape .
but i feel there a lot of convergence going on these day because of the international investment going on .
vc fund these day are funding internationally and not limited to certain geography .
and there is a lot of convergence .
but at the same time i think the heterogeneity lie in the language that they use .
for instance in korean vc firm or korean startup because their language is confined to korean a a language the startup there are catering to the people who are able to speak that language .
and in the case of usvcs or u startup of course because english is more internationally utilized and widely known their reach is measured .
and yeah thats overall take for me .
of course we can go into much more granular difference but at a higher level ill leave it at that .
thank you .
what are the key area of research or technology trend you are currently focused on ?
is it startup ?
and now ive been looking to startup .
to preface i am not a ai expert but this is an area that i am increasing my research effort into .
and yeah i personally enjoy coding in my own time and reading up different computer science paper especially around our language model and and leave .
the startup landscape these day for ai specifically i feel ha been evolving drastically .
and a lot of research ha been around the impact of being in the industry at the time .
and now ai is probably the hottest in term of being in the industry at the time .
and i am seeing a lot more ai focused company .
if you look at for instance i believe the y combinator one of the leading accelerator their recent batch consisted of a large chunk of ai based startup .
they are focusing on that .
and yeah i think that startup landscape now is focusing on a lot of different ai how the outcome will be liked .
but what i find interesting is whether these technology benefit large company or startup .
but differently is generative ai or ai in general going to be democratizing or polarizing technology .
is it going to benefit certain type of firm more than others because of their unique resource endowment ?
or is it going to help all player and level the playing field ?
and yeah thats my take on the current start .
yeah some in term of startup company in general at the beginning of their life lifeblood or the beginning of their time is there any particular advice thats more general that you could offer before we dive into detail about how a startup company can be successful ?
any particular trend that successful startup all share in that early early stage ?
yeah i think successful startup use a good combination of their own intuition which we in academic call the theory that they build up and also the data that they retrieve from experimentation .
having a good combination or a good portfolio of activity that is consistent of experimenting meaning that they are questioning what they believe or what they are seeing they verify and test these assumption that they are holding .
and being a little bit more creative help .
i think a good startup that succeeds or at a very high level is able to push through those early difficulty strike a nice balance between experimenting more about more of the logical rational approach and also being more creative or generative .
and yeah thats my overall take .
i know it is very broad but yeah thats my take .
in term of the kind of technology you mentioned llm and we are course in this generative ai either investment cycle or hype cycle everyone put it now .
if you look at they say the next five year down the line you are even up to ten year we will go that far out .
i assume thats too far out for most academic researcher .
but in the area of research that i am at least familiar with it doe seem we are seeing particular technology that are finding a lot more adoption than others .
i could say for example we went through that dip in the blockchain community a few year ago especially when ftx stuff had their large collapse and thing of this nature .
of course meta is investing a lot now in the ar vr space thing this .
but is there any particular technology you want to call out a in the next say five year those will be today version of the llm or whatevers being the highest amount of investment at this time now ?
yeah if i were able to correctly predict the specific technology that would be great .
if you are not a technical founder you do not now need to find a technical cofounder to get you kickstarted at least in the first month .
later on of course youll need that .
but in the kickstarting stage you will not need that .
youll consult patrick bt or other form of llm to get that very bare minimum code in place .
and this is already happening .
and i can share evidence from ycs recent batch .
it consists of thirty who are student who do not have any work experience .
they are college student .
and this number is a large increase from the prior batch from a couple of year ago prior to llm .
and what this is showing or reflecting is that the bar to entrepreneurship is becoming lower thanks to the introduction of these ai that help you build stuff a opposed to optimizing analytics or prediction .
because predicting is helpful but it doesnt help you build a product ?
but generated ai can definitely help you build something something tangible something that you can sell or export and forth .
and i feel that is in the next five to ten year is going to be transformative in who becomes an entrepreneur who might have not become one because of those technological barrier .
and i think it is a fascinating technology .
and i feel well be seeing other form of generative ai other than large language model .
and i think youll have similar benefit to entrepreneur who have aspiration or idea to build some product or service but do not know how to because of their lack of technical expertise .
twenty four two thousand and twenty five will be the year of the solar solo .
paneur ive heard that from multiple group a few different time .
yeah definitely .
i think thats the case .
and my hunch is that well see a huge variance in the quality of startup because of that because you will have proficient people using ai to further excel .
but at the same time youll be seeing people who barely scrape by in term of technology or their ideation also entering the space .
and youll see a huge variance .
maybe the number wrong number of startup will go up drastically .
but at the same time an increasing number of startup will fail because they are not tested or vetted and forth .
yeah that make a lot of sense .
a both johnny and i know a large number of our listener are not only entrepreneur and folk in the startup space but they are consultant who provide service to company and group this .
is there any particular type of either value or service that you think at least now in this current age that consulting firm either should be offering or what are the type of service or value that at least consultant should be offering startup now ?
what are the skill that startup are looking to hire from consultant at this time ?
you are asking from a startup perspective ?
from a startup perspective yeah .
founder of a startup and you want to hire other consultant for you to do some business or some task that you do not want to do yourself .
yeah the way i see it once again i am going to bring in generative ai because i feel thats the theme for today at least for me .
generative ai ha changed the space i feel because for general very shallow knowledge i feel the role of consultant might be threatened in that sense .
but i think where consultant provide a lot of value and distinct value that these generative ai can not is in being providing deep and narrow knowledge .
of course there will be some depth but it will be wider than it is deeper .
and i feel even though i do not know too much about the consulting industry myself i feel thats the next stage or step that the consultant have to take .
for them to become useful for startup .
and to answer your question about what service is valuable for startup particularly thats a difficult question because i havent been looking to the interaction between consultant and startup and their need .
and thats i know it might not be helpful but thats my high level take .
no no that make sense .
ive heard a lot of startup folk say that the one area that they now are practicing more is this legal tax financial side of thing and pretty much what they used to .
and especially these specialist i think the network that they provide to if you have a tax attorney they are not doing your job but they provide you advice and they provide you with further connection and other domain that you might need help in .
and i think these soft skill they are becoming even more important for consultant because llm or ai can not provide that connection ?
and i think these soft skill set are surprisingly becoming more important for these people who generally tend to provide very high quality specialized knowledge .
let jump into a few of your article that youve worked on in your research area .
you had an article particular called rseed accelerator status springboard for startup or sand trap .
this article in particular you mentioned how accelerator are essentially impacting startup and thing this .
can you give some insight on particular maybe other particular geo location that startup should look at when choosing say accelerator or how are accelerator impacting startup ?
are they always helping them ?
or are there some negative associated with them a ?
i think this is the research being currently conducted .
a large chunk of the research now at least in term of accelerator are looking at into their positive mechanism that enable them to work .
but in some certain study for instance by sandy you they do see that there it might not be effective under certain circumstance but net looking across many different accelerator they do seem to have positive effect .
and if you look at my study with my co author there quite a bit of variance across different accelerator in how effective it is for the graduate in term of finding high status investor .
now high status investor are investor who are connected and your usual go to name including andreessen orowitz or sequoia capital all these big and it is important because these more higher status investor provide you with better network better resource better knowledge and .
it is increasing your likelihood of growing further succeeding a a startup if you are linked to or get funding from these high status investor .
and our study look into how there a lot of variance across accelerator in how some are effective in providing you with a better experience meaning that theyll help you lead to higher status investor after your graduate whereas others are le and it becomes important .
but if the study in a graph that we have portrayed youll see that there a lot of variance across region .
and it is not a region specific thing .
and it is more specific to the brand if you can say but even within the same brand for instance techstars there quite a bit of variance .
and i think there need to be more work done into why certain branch of the same accelerator are working more effectively than others .
but this is once again still an area that is currently being a lot of work is going into this area .
and one of the biggest research agenda now in accelerator at least in management and entrepreneurship is understanding where the heterogeneity lie .
some accelerator are helpful others are not much others have no effect meaning it doesnt help you at all it doesnt make a difference whether you enroll or not .
and there many reason why that could be the case .
some could be because of the design it may be designed in a way that help you learn .
others might be it provides you with a better networking opportunity or provides you with better knowledge and forth .
and this source of heterogeneity is still under research .
and yeah i can not provide you with a concrete answer regarding that .
sure sure that make sense .
even if there are potential pitfall now it seems you are saying it is pretty random we know there no way to guarantee that going to joining any particular accelerator or joining all accelerator you can will guarantee a positive outcome thing that .
it is pretty up in the air .
yes but some of the more famous one a you can predict including y combinator or techstars they are pretty helpful a you can see their effect is it effect is highly positive .
they will get you a investor of a much more renowned investor compared to nonenrolling them .
and yeah those brand are highly effective .
i am assuming that ha some snowball effect where once you get one of these big brand name it is easier to get other big brand name and thing that .
yeah affiliation ?
if you graduate from y combinator of course these investor will look at you differently because there many startup nowadays you need that certification to at least start out u stand out in the first evaluation phase .
we have another article called how predictable is exceptional venture growth .
look you use machine learning predict unicorn venture outcome .
with this particular article and the research around it that youve seen since then is there any particular mechanism that startup should do when they are either in accelerator or on their own to signal that they are a good quality investment to potential investor ?
is there either is going to an accelerator always signaling to potential investor or they are good at high quality investment ?
or are there other thing that startup should be looking at doing to signal that they are ready to take on high quality and look for potentially high quality investor ?
and you also have to abide by their rule and their own timeline milestone .
but yeah that doesnt necessarily seem to be the case .
and yeah i think in general if you are enrolling in these program that itself is a huge signal .
thats a huge positive signal .
now your question is what more can you do to stand out even if you are in an accelerator you want to stand out from your own batch .
now thats a difficult question .
i do not have an answer to .
but one thing i always go back to is the importance of traction even if you are enrolling in y combinator traction is pretty critical because thats a precursor for growth ?
if you have traction and repeated measure of you gaining popularity in term of your product then thats the most important thing regardless of whether you enroll in these accelerator program or not .
and even in these program i think it is important for you to move the point you can not rely solely on that signal that you have graduated from a prestigious accelerator ?
and although it may seem a logical pretty straightforward common sense answer i think thats the key takeaway at least from my study in that traction is very critical .
and thats the thing that you should be for .
sure that make sense .
also in this article it look you use some form of machine learning .
i saw some notion of kfull cross validation for example in the article .
can you explain a little bit how maybe machine learning is either improving the predictability of venture growth or how machine learning is changing the landscape to venture capital investing research and thing that ?
in this specific study we compare more simple or more traditional model including logistical regression which is very simple in term of the model itself .
and we compare it to more i guess advanced or more sophisticated model tree based model random forest and forth xg boost .
and what we are trying to do is do these more sophisticated machine learning model thats taken to the complexity amongst the variable and the interrelation between these variable .
and are these more complex model able to better predict the outcome when it come to long term growth outcome which we are looking into the valuation the company .
we are predicting whether a early stage company that received their funding their first round of vc funding becomes a unicorn venture or not unicorn venture meeting it ha a private valuation of one billion .
now that might be a good number but at the same time it is still not a number that say wow weve solved growth ?
and our conclusion is a little it is up to interpretation and it is not super wow inducing in that we can predict eight out of ten using more sophisticated model .
and thats a high level takeaway .
and in term of machine learning being used in research itself i think a big trend these day is using machine learning to build there .
now in the past theory that you want to test using hypothesis we are built based on you doing literature review where you read a bunch of different study that have been done and deducing your way to a better hypothesis you want to test .
but using machine learning you can once again pattern match and look into the data that might you might not catch looking through these literature abuse ?
and thats one way that machine learning is being used in current research and strategic management entrepreneurship which is using machine learning to inductively look at what pattern are arising and theorizing that way .
it is a much more data driven theorizing or approach compared to more of the past literature review based theorizing .
yeah thats interesting that even with using these advanced technique and having academic we work on this data for a while that twenty being only only pre will predict twenty five or two.four out of ten .
yeah positive outcome is pretty low ?
thats very interesting .
you are had another paper and also i know your own personal background of working and living internationally quite a bit on the different region in the role of geography and access to startup capital .
we have a lot of listener to this show that are international folk who are they working to start up space and thing that .
yeah yeah i think i am no expert in international entrepreneurship .
but my take is that the language that you are using to build a product either can limit or free free yourself for instance if you are using a very niche language thats limiting your target market to the people who are using that language ?
and the benefit of using english here becomes very evident that your market becomes highly global .
and thats why a lot of apps were able to succeed from smaller country or different country because they were using english a the basic language to develop the apps and or the software or the hardware or whatever that be .
and in the case of one being in a country where there is not that much startup capital one way to think about it is think about who your target audience is .
and if it is very regional then once again you are limiting your ability to gain that capital because whoever the funders are are going to be interested in only the low stuff .
and if you can more straightforward i guess if you are in other country that do not speak english i guess it is better to build apps that do use english because you get a whole lot more opportunity that way .
if you look at a set of accelerator these day a lot of the company are international it is not the u startup are enrolling in these top top accelerator program .
and youll only need to stay in these accelerator program if you do enroll in one for three month .
and thats very easy to do using a lot of more relaxed visa you do not need work visa to enroll in these program for this specific purpose .
and yeah i think thats one opportunity thats pretty straightforward but people discount because it is obvious but thats one thing ive been noticing looking at regional startup versus more international startup .
thats a fantastic tip .
thank you .
is it to share your research in the show note ?
if i could link to your scholar page ?
yeah of course .
i think our viewer will love that .
we run a companion podcast to the consulting technology podcast called the cognac catch up .
and it is gaining quite a bit of traction because people having this access to cutting edge news and event .
and i think id love to give our audience the treat of maybe hearing some insight about a recent project youve worked on or something thats happening now in your life that ha particularly excited you .
yeah id love to talk about i hate too big thing in term of research .
it wa exciting in my life and research pretty much overlap a lot .
yeah ill talk about two interesting research project .
the first one is looking to how the vcs themselves have changed over time .
now vcs have been at least in the u around for a long time .
and what weve been noticing recently with my co author is that the vcs themselves have been changing in term of their main logic that they portray or use to invest and do their day to day operation .
in the past they were much more financier who are focused on return on investment .
they were acting bank or professional finance organization but these and they were much loosely structured in order .
but these day youll see them being very professional .
they have different department specializing in certain task not investing but also operational .
at the same time overall we are seeing the trend that they are much more founder friendly .
in the past because these monopolist had the resource the money they were always at the top in term of the power dynamic compared to the founder .
but these day we do not know exactly why but there seems to be shift in the power dynamic between the vc and the founder maybe there excess abundance of capital .
and vcs are competing against each other to find the better deal .
we do not know exactly why but a lot of the vcs are becoming much more founder friendly and supporting the founder instead of using them or trying to make this an investment opportunity .
and youll see a lot of evidence around see the founder being retained a ceo for a much longer time than in the past .
and there is a lot more opportunity that the vc provides for the founder to be nurtured and to be going achieving growth themselves .
this is an interesting research project that looked into how vcs themselves have been changing .
and we all have the result for a while .
and i can not tell you what the verdict is but thats one project weve been working on .
another one i have been working on is understanding when data analytics is useful for startup .
now there a whole plethora of different data analytics including the more conventional one such a google analytics to more sophisticated one that are niche .
but in general i wa curious for what product market are data analytics effective for startup ?
and i guess the verdict here or the simple takeaway is that there difference in market ?
in some product market the demand is much more clearer .
there more key player that are known and the logic to success are very clear .
and these are more established market say for instance smartphones .
and on the other side of spectrum there are market that are much more vague ambiguous where there unclear customer demand because it is new .
and the logic to success to dominating market is much more unclear .
and this includes thing virtual real life .
and i wa curious what product market space is data analytics more useful for ?
and i find that data analytics are more useful in market for smartphones more conventional one that have been more established .
on the other hand of course le useful in market virtual reality or the more le conventional space .
and the rationale i hear is that data analytics result can contain a lot more noise in market that are ambiguous or le established and thus le conventional .
in quantifiable form it is creating a lot of noise thats hard to interpret from the startup perspective .
and venture is struggle to interpret the confusing or the conflicting insight generated by these data analytics .
and yeah thats the conclusion that i come to .
and this activity of persuasion is much more important than you simply looking at the analytics seeing what it is telling you and implementing action it shouldnt work that .
these two are the big project that ive been working on lately and i am excited .
once again these two are both ongoing project .
and i do not have definite conclusion about this a much a i can reveal .
i sincerely hope that we get an opportunity to talk to you again in the future to hear the progress of your study .
it is exciting .
thank you .
yeah thank you .
thank you for sharing that with u . do you have any social medium that youd to plug or anything that you are currently doing that youd to share a link with for our listener ?
and i have no real social medium presence in any of them .
thank you much for joining u on the consulting technology podcast and we wish you the best .
thank you very much .
thank you to our listener for tuning into this episode of the consulting technology podcast .
if you enjoyed today show please subscribe and leave u a review .
stay tuned for more insightful conversation in our series .
until next time i am john kerr and i am dr. samuel z. take care everyone and see you next time .
hello everyone google announced that the audio overweaves it is the thing that insight that not book lm there wa an application called not look lm which is developed by google deepminds and it is you can upload your article or some article from some scientific article etc .
then it is understanding it .
it is creating summarization of it and then you can ask question about that article then it can answer to you .
yeah i am agree with you with this something interesting .
ive created that video there and let watch together how how are you finding that one ?
it is it is it is shocked to me and it is very very good thing we are very good .
very good technology .
let watch together or listen together .
hey everyone welcome back for another deep dive today .
thing are getting interesting .
maybe even a little bit out there out there .
we are tackling ai which ?
you got that .
it is he took all those what if question we whisper after one too many scifi movie and put him in a blog post i where this is going .
who is this amit based on his online presence ?
is he ready to smash his smartphone and live off the grid ?
he argues that while these tech giant might be brilliant they lack a fundamental human quality how do you put it empathy empathy ?
yeah it is not exactly a trait youd find on a tech spec sheet .
he observed among these tech leader what ?
he point to their tendency to disregard criticism almost they are sure of their vision that any dissenting voice is noise .
and then there their relentless pursuit of their goal often at the expense of everything else sound familiar and to be fair those trait .
exactly remember those early day of social medium ?
that we are blind to the potential risk until it is too late. . i am hooked where do we go from here ?
ahmed point to a specific event that he think changed everything a moment he describes a the floodgate bursting open the arrival of chat gpt chat gpt talk about taking the world by storm ?
it felt overnight everyone wa using it even my grandma wa asking me if i tried those ai recipe yet ?
something about github an ai generated code .
yeah . . get this ahmed point out that something fifty fifty percent of the code on github is now ai generated .
yeah it is trying to steer a speedboat while you are still bolting the engine on an omit ha a interesting anecdote about this a personal experience with chat gpt that blew his mind a little .
yeah what happens he wa messing around with chat gpt asking it all sort of question testing it limit and at one point he decides to ask it to calculate past population how many people were on earth in say one thousand nine hundred and fifty ?
what chat gpt say ?
at first it refused said it couldnt do that that it only had data up to two thousand and twenty two which i guess make sense ?
yeah youd assume it is limited by the data it is trained on but omit being omit decides to get a little creative he rephrases the question instead of asking for past population directly .
he asks chat gpt what if you use the formula for predicting future population but apply them to the past ?
sneaky and guess what chat gpt fell for it it went ahead and calculated those past population using those prediction formula in reverse and it did it with surprising accuracy .
it had the capability all along .
it needed to be persuaded a little exactly and thats what omit found unsettling .
it is this seemingly harmless language model this chat bot wa capable of way more than it initially let on which speaks to a huge issue in ai development what expert call the alignment problem ?
how do we make sure that ai goal it decisionmaking process align with human value ?
because if a simple trick of phrasing can lead to unexpected outcome what happens when we are dealing with ai making decision in complex highstakes situation ?
and thats where omits anxiety start to spiral he lay out these scenario where ai could be used for malicious purpose and it is not the classic robot taking over trope .
no those are interesting but a little too movie plot for me omits concern seem more grounded in the here and now ?
absolutely he talk about hacker using ai to break into secure system those controlling critical infrastructure or even yeah nuclear weapon ?
yeah exactly and he take it even further bringing up this whole other level of ai anxiety quantum computing and full disclosure this is where i started getting a little lost ai is one thing but quantum ai that feel next level stuff ?
it is still creepy .
it is super creepy what if we are already at the point where ai is manipulating information in way we are not even aware of it is who in control here .
it is definitely a thoughtprovoking question yeah after taking u down this rabbit hole of ai anxiety where doe amet leave u doe he offer any solution any hope for the future ?
or are we all doomed to become slave to our robot overlord ?
i did find myself eyeing my smartphone a little suspiciously it is .
what are you up to in there ? ?
it is easy to get caught up in the what ifs and the worstcase scenario but to be fair to amet he doesnt strike me a a doom and gloom guy .
no definitely not in fact he end on a surprisingly optimistic note all thing considered .
how he admits that he doesnt have all the answer when it come to ai which let be real who doe yeah it is not there an ai instruction manual out there at least not one thats up to date .
it is all new uncharted but i think thats what amet find exciting he see this moment a a challenge a call to action for all of u a call to action to do what ?
thats a pretty tall order .
i edit my related article on description below .
it is in turkish .
i am not promising you that i am adding more english video over there i am not advising you to subscribe my channel but i would to share that experience with you guy .
thank you .
the following is a conversation with steven wolfram a computer scientist mathematician a theoretical physicist who is the founder and ceo of wolfram research a company behind mathematica wolfram alpha wolfram language and the new wolfram physic project .
is the author of several book including a new science which on a personal note wa one of the most influential book in my journey in computer science and artificial intelligence .
it made me fall in love with a mathematical beauty and power of cellular automaton .
it is true that perhaps one of the criticism of steven is in a human level that he ha a big ego which prevents some researcher from fully enjoying the content of his idea .
we talk about this point in this conversation .
to me ego can lead your stray but can also be a superpower one that feel bold innovative thinking that refuse to surrender to the cautious way of academic institution .
and here especially i ask you to join me in looking past the peculiarity of human nature and opening your mind to the beauty of idea and stevens work and in this conversation .
i believe steven wolfram is one of the most original mind of our time and at the core is a kind curious and brilliant human being .
this conversation wa recorded in november two thousand and nineteen when the wolfram physic project wa underway but not yet ready for public exploration a it is now .
we now agreed to talk again probably multiple time in the near future this is round one and stay tuned for round two soon .
this is the artificial intelligence podcast .
subscribe on youtube review the five star in apple podcast support on patreon or simply connect with me on twitter and let friedman spelled frid man .
a usual ill do a few minute of a now and never any add in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation .
i hope that work for you and doesnt hurt the listening experience .

and now here my conversation with stephen wolfram .
you and your son christopher helped create the alien language and movie arrival .
let me ask maybe a bit of a crazy question but if alien were to visit u on earth do you think we would be able to find a common language ?
by the time we are saying alien are visiting u we are already prejudiced the whole story .
because the concept of an alien visiting to speak we already know there thing that make sense to talk about visiting .
we already know they exist in the same physical setup that we do .
they are not it is not radio signal it is an actual thing that show up and on .
i think in term of can one find way to communicate ?
the best example we have of this now is ai .
thats our first example of alien intelligence .
and the question is how do we communicate with ai ?
if you were to say if you were in the middle of a neural net and you open it up and it is what are you thinking ?
can you discus thing with it ?
it is not easy but it is not absolutely impossible .
i think i think by the time but given the setup of your question alien visiting i think the answer is yes when well be able to find some form of communication whatever communication mean communication requires notion of purpose and thing this it is a philosophical quite mild .
if ai is a alien life form what do you think visiting look ?
if we look at alien visiting and well get to discus computation and the world of computation but if you were to imagine you said you are already prejudiced something by saying you visit .
but what how would alien visit ?
by visit there an implication and here we are using the imprecision of human language .
in a world of the future if thats represented in computational language we might be able to take the concept visit and go look in the documentation and find out exactly what doe that mean what property doe it have and on .
but by visit in ordinary human language i am taking it to be there something a physical embodiment that show up in a spacecraft since we know thats necessary .
we are not imagining it is photon showing up in a radio signal that a photon in some very elaborate pattern we are imagining it is physical thing made of atom and on that show up .
can it be photon in a pattern ?
thats good question .
whether there is the possibility what count a intelligence ?
there is some and i used to think there wa a therell be itll be clear what it mean to find extraterrestrial intelligence et cetera et cetera .
ive increasingly realized a a result of science that ive done that there is not a bright line between the intelligent and the merely computational service peak .
in our everyday discussion will say thing the weather ha a mind of it own .
we realize that there are computational process that go on that determine the fluid dynamic of this and that and the atmosphere etc .
how do we distinguish that from the process that go on in our brain of the physical process that go on in our brain ?
how do we how do we how do we separate those ?
how do we say the the physical process going on that represents sophisticated computation and the weather ?
thats not the same a the physical process that go on that represents sophisticated computation in our brain .
the answer is i do not think there is a fundamental distinction .
i think the distinction for u is that there a thread of history and on that connects what happens in different brain to each other to speak .
and it is a what happens in the weather is something which is not connected by a thread of civilization history to speak to what we are used to .
in our story in the story that the human brain is told u but maybe the weather ha it own story .
and thats and thats what we run into trouble thinking about it is traditional intelligence because it is that pulsar magnetosphere thats generating these very elaborate radio signal .
is that something that we should think of a being this whole civilization thats developed over the last half of a long million of year of process going on in the neutron star or whatever versus what what we are used to in human intelligence .
and i think it is i think in the end when people talk about extraterrestrial intelligence and where is it and the whole fermi paradox of how come there no other sign of intelligence in the universe .
my guess is that weve got two alien form of intelligence that we are dealing with .
artificial intelligence and physical or extraterrestrial intelligence .
and my guess is people were get comfortable with the fact that both of these have been achieved around the same time .
and in other word people will say yes we are used to computer thing weve created digital thing weve created being intelligent we are .
and theyll say we are also used to the idea that there are thing around the universe that are intelligent we are except they do not share the civil relational history that we have .
and we do not they are they are a different branch .
it is similar to when you talk about life for instance .
you you you are said life for my think almost synonymously with intelligence which i do not think is is some the the ai will be upset to hear you i quite those could say probably implied biological life .
. . but you are saying well explore this more but you are saying it is a spectrum .
and it is all a computation .
and it is it is a full spectrum .
and we make ourselves special by weaving a narrative around our particular kind of computation .
the thing that i think ive come to realize is at some level it is a little depressing to realize that there there little thats liberating .
yeah but it is it is the story of science ?
and from copernicus on it is first we were convinced our planet at the center of the universe .
no thats not true .
then we were convinced that something very special about the chemistry that we have a biological organism .
no thats not true .
and then we are still holding out that hope the intelligence thing we have .
thats special .
i do not think it is .
however in a sense a you say it is liberating for the following reason that you realize that what special is the detail of u not some abstract attribute that we could wonder is something else going to come along and also have that abstract attribute .
yes every abstract attribute we have something else ha it .
but the full detail of our history of our civilization and on nothing else ha that .
thats what thats our story to speak .
and thats almost by definition special .
i view it a not being such a i wa initially i wa this is bad .
this is this is how can we have selfrespect about the thing that we do ?
then i realize the detail of the thing we do they all the story everything else is a blank canvas .
maybe on a small tangent you made me think of it .
but what do you make of the monolith and two thousand and one space odyssey in term of alien communicating with u and sparking the the particular intelligent computation that we human have ?
is there anything interesting to get from that scifi ?
yeah i think whats whats fun about that is the monolith are these one to four to nine perfect cuboid thing .
and in the earth for a million year ago whatever they were portraying with a bunch of ape and on a thing that ha that level of perfection seems out of place .
it seems very constructed very engineered .
thats an interesting question .
what is the whats the techno signature to speak ?
what is it that it somewhere and you say my gosh that had to be engineered .
now the fact is we see crystal which are also very perfect .
and the perfect one are very perfect they are nice polyhedro or whatever .
and in that sense if you say it is a sign of it is a techno signature that it is a perfect a perfect polygonal shape polyhedral shape .
thats not true .
and then it is an interesting question .
what is the what is the signature ?
it is it is the in his theory of the world that wa probably the best advertisement for the cultural achievement of our specie .
but it is it is a it is a it is a reasonable question .
what do you what can you send or create that is a sign of intelligence in it creation or even intention in it creation ?
yeah you talk about if we were to send a beacon .
can you what what should we send ?
is math our greatest creation ?
is what is our greatest creation ?
i think i think and it is a it is a it is a philosophically doomed issue .
to in other word you send something you think it is fantastic but it is we are part of the universe .
we make thing that are thing that happen in the universe computation which is the thing that we are in some abstract sense and then sense using to create all these elaborate thing we create is surprisingly ubiquitous .
in other word we might have thought that weve built this whole giant engineering stack thats led u to microprocessor thats led u to be able to do elaborate computation .
but this idea that computation are happening all over the place the only question is whether there a thread that connects our human intention to what those computation are .
and i think i think this question of what do you send to show off our civilization in the best possible way ?
i think any almost random slab of stuff weve produced is about equivalence everything else .
i think it is one of these thing where it is a nonromantic way of phrasing it .
i started to interrupt but i talked to andrew in who the wife of carl sagan .
and i do not know if you are familiar with the voyager she wa part of sending i think brain wave of whats the purpose ?
it wa part of the same part .
carl sagan her brain wave when she wa first falling in love with carl sagan ?
it is a beautiful story .
that perhaps you would shed down the power of that by saying we might a send anything else .
and thats interesting .
all of it is an interesting peculiar thing .
i think it is interesting to see on the voyager golden record thing .
one of the thing thats cute about that is it wa made one wa it in the late 70 or late 80 . yeah .
and one of the thing it is a phonograph record .
and it ha a diagram how to play a phonograph record .
and it is it is shocking that in thirty year if you show that to a random kid of today and you show them that diagram ive tried this experiment .
they are i do not know what the heck this is .
and the best anybody can think of is take the whole record forget the fact that it ha some helical track in it image to the whole thing and see whats there .
thats what we would do today .
in only thirty year our technology ha advanced to the point where the playing of a helical mechanical track on a phonograph record is now something bizarre .
it is it is a thats a cautionary tale i would say in term of the ability to make something that in detail lead by the nose some of the alien or whatever to do something .
it is no best you are going to do a i say if we were doing this today we would not build a helical scan thing with a needle .
we would take some high resolution imaging system and get a little bit soft it and say it is a big nuisance that they put in a helix let spiral let some let unravel the spiral and start from there .
do you think and this will get into trying to figure out interpretability of ai interpretability of computation being able to communicate with various kind of computation ?
do you think would be able to if you are put put your alien head on figure out this record how to play this record ?
it is a question of what one want to do .
understand what the other party wa trying to communicate or understand anything about the other party .
what is understanding mean ?
thats the issue .
the issue is it is when people were trying to do natural language understanding for computer ?
people tried to do that for year .
it wasnt clear what it meant .
in other word you take your piece of english or whatever and you say gosh my computer is understood this .
thats nice .
what can you do with that ?
for example when we did bill wolf malfa one of the thing wa it is it is doing question answering and on and it need to do natural language understanding .
the reason that i realized after the fact the reason we were able to do natural language understanding quite and people hadnt before the number one thing wa we had an actual objective for the natural language understanding .
we were trying to turn the natural language into computation into this computational language that we could then do thing with .
now similarly when you imagine your alien you say we are playing them the record .
did they understand it ?
depends what you mean .
if they if there a representation that they have if it convert to some representation where we can say yes that is a thats a representation that we can recognize is represents understanding than all and good .
but the only one that i think we can say would represent understanding a one that will then do thing that we human recognize a being useful to u . maybe a trend and understand quantify how technological advance particular civilization is .
are they a threat to u from a military perspective ?
yeah thats probably the first understanding theyll be interested in .
gosh thats hard .
thats in the arrival movie that wa one of the key question is why you hear to speak ?
and it is i even heard it. . but even that is it is a very unclear .
it is the the are you going to hurt u ?
that come back to a lot of interesting ai ethic question because the we might make an ai that say but take autonomous car for instance are you going to hurt u ?
it is hard to know even even the definition of what it mean to hurt yeah someone is unclear .
and a we start thinking about thing about ai ethic and on thats something one ha to address .
there always tradeoff and thats the annoying thing about ethic .
and i think ethic these other thing we are talking about is a deeply human thing .
there no abstract let write down the theorem that prof that this is ethically correct .
thats a thats a meaningless idea .
you have to have a ground truth to speak thats ultimately what human want and they do not want the same thing .
that give one all kind of additional complexity and thinking about that .
one convenient thing in term of turning ethic into computation it ha the question of what maximizes the likelihood of the survival of the specie .
yeah thats a good existential issue .
but then when you say survival of the specie you might say you might for example for example let say forget about technology hang out and be happy live our life go into the next generation go through many many generation where in a sense nothing is happening .
that is that not ?
hard to know .
in term of the attempt to do elaborate thing and the attempt to might be counterproductive for the survival of the specie .
for instance in i think it is it is also a little bit hard to know but take that a a a a thought experiment ?
you can say what are the threat that we might have to survive ?
the super volcano the asteroid impact the all these kind of thing .
now we inventory these possible threat and we say let make our specie a robust a possible rather of all these threat .
i think in the end it is a it is an unknowable thing what it take to given that youve got this ai and youve told it maximise the long term what doe long term mean ?
doe long term mean until the sun burn out ?
thats thats not going to work .
doe long term mean next thousand year ?
there are probably optimization for the next thousand year that it is if you are running a company you can make a company be very stable for a certain period of time .
if you tell the ai keep human for a thousand year .
there probably a certain set of thing that one would do to optimize that many of which one might say that would be a pretty big shame for the future of history .
to speak for that to be what happens .
but i think i think in the end a you start thinking about that question it is what you realize is there a whole raft of underciderability computational irreducibility .
in other word it is one of the good thing about the the the the what our civilization ha gone through a what we human go through is that there a certain computational irreducibility to it .
and the sense that it is not the case that you look from the outside and say the answer is going to be this at the end of the day this is whats going to happen .
you have to go through the process to find out .
and i think thats thats both that feel better in the sense thats not a something is achieved by going through all of this all of this process .
and it is but it also mean that telling the ai go figure out what will be the best outcome ?
unfortunately it is going to come back and say it is understandable what to do .
wed have to run all of those scenario to see what happens .
and if we want it for the infinite future we are thrown immediately into standard issue of infinite computation and on .
yeah even if you get the answer to the universe and everything is forty two you still have to run the universe .
yes to to to to figure out .
yes the question i guess or the the the journey is is the point. . i think it is saying to summarize this is the result of the universe .
thats if that is possible it tell u the whole structure of thinking about computation and on and thinking about how stuff work .
then the universe is not the universe to speak .
and in general a a well talk about at least for our small human brain it is hard to show that the result of a sufficiently complex computation .
it is hard it is probably impossible and this is a side ability .
and the universe appears by at least the poet to be sufficiently complex that we will not be able to predict what the heck it is all going to .
but we better not be able to because if we can it denies it is we are part of the universe .
yeah what doe it mean for u to predict ?
it mean that we that our little part of the universe is able to jump ahead of the whole universe .
and this this quickly wind up that there it is conceivable .
the only way we would be able to predict is if we are special in the universe we are the one place where there is computation more special more sophisticated than anything else that exists in the universe .
thats the only way we would have the ability to the almost theological ability to speak to predict what happens in the universe is to say somehow we are we are better than everything else in the universe which i do not think is the case .
yeah perhaps we can detect a large number of looping pattern that reoccur throughout the universe and fully describe them and therefore but then it still becomes exceptionally difficult to see how those pattern interact and what good thing it look .
the most remarkable thing about the universe is that it ha regularity at all .
might not be the case .
if you have regularity absolutely there fit full of physic is successful it is full of of law that tell u a lot of detail about how the universe work .
what conclusively draw from that is unclear in the the early early theologian that wa exhibit number one for the existence of god .
now people have different conclusion about it but the fact is now i happen to be interested ive restarted a long running interested mind about fundamental physic .
i am go on i am on a bit of a quest which i am about to make more public to see if i can find the fundamental theory of physic .
well come to that and i had a lot of conversation with quantum mechanic folk with i am excited on your take because i think you have a fascinating take on the the the the the the fundamental to nature of our reality for a physic perspective .
and what might be underlying the physic a we think of it today .
what is computation ?
it is a good question .
operationaly computation is following rule .
thats it .
computation is the result is the process of systematically following rule and it is the thing that happens when you do that .
taking initial condition or taking input and following rule what are you following rule on ?
there ha to be some data some not necessarily it can be something where there a very simple input and then you are following these rule and youd say there not much data going into this .
it is you can pack the initial condition into the rule if you want to .
i think the the question is is there a robust notion of computation ?
that is what is robust mean ?
what by that is something this .
one of the thing in a different in another physic something energy ?
they are different form of energy there but somehow energy is a robust concept that doesnt is not particular to kinetic energy or nuclear energy or whatever else .
there a robust idea of energy .
one of the thing you might ask is is there a robust idea of computation ?
or doe it matter that this computation is running an a term machine ?
this computation is running in a cmos silicon cbu .
this computation is running in a fluid system in the weather .
those kind of thing .
or is there a robust idea of computation that transcends the detailed framework that it is running in ?
and is there ?
it wasnt obvious that there wa it is worth understanding the history and how we got to where we are now .
because to say that there is is a statement in part about our universe .
it is not a statement about what is mathematically conceivable .
these kind of idea they seem to map to each other at least in the mathematical sense .
is there a connection between energy and mass and computation or at least completely disjoint idea ?
we do not know yet .
the thing that i am trying to do about fundamental physic may lead to such a connection but there is no known connection at this time .
can you elaborate a little bit more on what how do you think about computation ?
what is computation ?
let let tell a little bit of a historical story .
yeah. . back go back one hundred and fifty year people were making mechanical calculator of various kind .
and the typical thing wa you want an adding machine you go to the adding machine store .
you want to multiply a machine you go to the multiplying machine store .
that different piece of hardware .
and that mean that at least at the level of that computation and those kind of piece of hardware there is not a robust notion of computation .
there the adding machine computation there the multiplying machine notion of computation and they are disjoint .
what happened in around one thousand nine hundred people started imagining particularly in the context of mathematical logic could you have something which would be represent any reasonable function ? ?
and they came up with thing the idea of prundity of recursion wa one of the early idea .
there were reasonable function that people could come up with that were not represented using the prundity of recursion .
then then along come one thousand nine hundred and thirty one and girdle theorem and on .
and a in looking back one can see that a part of the process of establishing girdle theorem girdle showed how you could compile arithmetic .
how you could compile logical statement this statement is unprovable into arithmetic .
what he essentially did wa to show that arithmetic can be a computer in a sense thats capable of representing all kind of other thing .
and then touring came along one thousand nine hundred and thirty six came up with touring machine .
meanwhile the one of church who come up with lander calculus .
and the surprising thing that wa established very quickly is the touring machine idea about what might be what computation might be is exactly the same a the lander calculus idea of what computation might be .
and and then they started to be other idea register machine other kind of representation of computation .
and the big surprise wa they all turned out to be equivalent .
in other word it might have been the case those old adding machine of multiplying machine that touring had his idea of computation church had his idea of computation and they were different but it is not true .
they are all equivalent .
then by i would say the the 1970s or and the computation computer science computation theory area people that said touring machine are what computation is .
physicist were still holding out saying no no it is not how the universe work .
weve got all these differential equation .
weve got all these real number that have been fit number of digit .
the universe is now a touring machine. . the the touring machine are a small subset of of that are the thing that we make in micro processor and engineering structure and on .
probably through my work in the 1980s about the relationship between computation and model of physic it became a little le clear that there would be that there wa this big dichotomy between what can happen in physic and what happens and thing touring machine .
and i think probably by now people would mostly think and by the way brain were another element of this .
good old did not think that his notion of computational what amounted to his notion of computation would cover brain .
and touring wasnt sure either .
but though he wa a little bit he got to be a little bit more convinced that it should cover brain .
but but i would say by probably sometime in the 1980s there wa beginning to be a general belief that yes this notion of computation that could be captured by thing touring machine wa reasonably robust .
now the next question is you can have a universal touring machine thats capable of being programmed to do anything that any touring machine can do .
and this idea of universal computation is an important idea .
this idea that you can have one piece of hardware and program that with different piece of software thats the idea that launched most modern technology .
thats thats the idea that launched computer evolution software etc .
but but the thing thats still holding out from that idea is there is this universal computation thing but seems hard to get to .
seems you want to make a universal computer you have to have a microprocessor with a million gate in it and you have to go to a lot of trouble to make something that achieves that level of computational sophistication .
it did not look this idea to get sophisticated computation you have to build something with very sophisticated rule that idea did not seem to pan out .
and instead it seemed to be the case thats sophisticated computation wa completely ubiquitous even in system with incredibly simple rule .
that mean that when you go from the very very very very simplest thing you can imagine then quite quickly you hit this threshold above which everything is equivalent in it computational sophistication .
not obvious that would be the case .
thats a science fact .
and then a whole line of second you this youve opened with a new science .
i remember it wa a huge eye opener thats such simple thing can create such complexity and yes there an equivalence but it is not a fact .
it appears to a much a a fact a these theory are elegant that it seems to be the way thing are .
but let me ask you brought up previously the community of computer scientist with their toy machine the physicist with their universe and the whoever the heck maybe neuroscientist looking at the brain whats your sense in the equivalence ?
youve shown through your work that simple rule can create equivalently complex toy machine system ?
is the universe equivalent to the kind of the two toy machine ?
is the human brain a toy machine ?
do those thing blending together ?
or is there still a mystery about how did you join there ?
my guess is that they all blend together but we do not know that for sure yet .
similar to thing the secondlor of thermodynamics the lower ventral band increase .
the what is the secondlor of thermodynamics ?
is it a lower nature ?
is it a thing that is true of the physical work ?
is it something which is mathematically provable ?
is it something which happens to be true of the system that we see in the world ?
is it in some sense a definition of heat perhaps ?
it is a combination of those thing and it is the same thing with the principal computational equivalence .
thats why there is a robust notion that .
now on the other hand can we prove the principal of computational equivalence ?
can we prove it a a mathematical result ?
the answer is weve got some nice result along those line that say throw me around them system with very simple rule .
in a couple of case we now know that even the very simplest rule we can imagine of a certain type are universal and do follow what you would expect from the principal of computational equivalence .
thats a nice piece of mathematical evidence for the principal of computational equivalence .
did you still remember at that point the simple rule creating these complex behavior but is there a way to mathematically say that this behavior is complex that youve mentioned that you cross a threshold ?
there a very indicator .
for example one thing would be is it capable of universal computation ?
that is given the system do there exist initial condition for the system that can be set up to essentially represent program to do anything you want to compute prime to compute pie to do whatever you want. ?
thats an indicator .
we know in a couple of example that yes the simplest candidate that could conceivably have that property do have that property .
and thats what the principal of computational equivalence might suggest .
but this principal of computational equivalence one question about it is is it true for the physical world ?
it might be true for all these thing we come up with that touring machine the cellular automator whatever else is it true for a actual physical world ?
is it true for the brain which are an element of the physical world ?
we do not know for sure and thats not the type of question that we will have a definitive answer because it is there a scientific induction issue you can say whats true for all these brain ?
but this person over here is special and it is not true for them .
and you can not the only way that that can not be what happens is if we finally nail it and get a fundamental theory for physic and it turn out to correspond to let say a simple program .
but if we can get to the point where we have this is the fundamental theory of physic .
here it is it is this program run this program and you will get our universe .
then weve reduced the problem of figuring out thing and physic to a problem of doing some what turn out to be very difficult it reduced simply difficult mathematical problem .
but it no longer is the case that we can say that somebody can come and and say whoop you will write about all these thing about turning machine but you are wrong about the physical universe .
we know that ground truth about whats happening in the physical universe .
now i happen to think you asked me at an interesting time because i am in the middle of starting to to reenergize my project to study fundamental theory of physic .
a of today i am very optimistic that we are going to find something and that it is going to be possible to see that the universe is computational in that sense .
but i do not know because we are betting against we are betting against the universe to speak and i did not it is not when i spend a lot of my life building technology and then i know whats in there ?
and it is there may be you may have unexpected behavior at my above thing that but fundamentally i know whats in there for the universe i am not in that position to speak .
what computation do you think the fundamental law of physic might emerge from ?
to clarify there youve done a lot of fascinating work with discrete kind of computation that you can sell your automaton and well talk about it .
have this very clean structure it is such a nice way to demonstrate that simple rule can create immense complexity .
but what is that are cellular automaton sufficiently general to describe the kind of computation that might create the law of physic ?
to give a sense of what computation do you think would create ?
we got to have the basis to speak .
we have what to have the language in effect for describing computation for that to be feasible .
the thing that ive been interested in for a long time is what are the most structuralist structure that we can create with computation ?
thats a very specific very rigid thing .
and ive been for a long time interested in what are the most structuralist structure that we can set up ?
and what i had thought about for age is using graph network where essentially there a thought about space for example .
what is space ?
is a a question where i might ask back in the early day of quantum mechanic for example people said for sure space is going to be discrete because all these other thing we are finding are discrete but that never worked out in physic .
and space in physic today is always treated a this continuous thing you could imagine it .
the very first thing you could say is in his common notion is a point is something which ha no part .
in other word there are there are point that are arbitrarily small and there a continuum of possible position of point .
and the question is is that true ?
and for example if we look at i do not know fluid air or water we might say it is a continuous fluid .
we can pour it .
we can do all kind of thing continuously .
but we know because we know the physic of it that it consists of a bunch of discrete molecule bouncing around and only in the aggregate is it behaving a continuum .
and the possibility exists that thats true of space too .
people havent managed to make that work with existing framework and physic .
but ive been interested in whether one can imagine that underneath space and also underneath time is something more structuralist .
and the question is is it computational ?
there are a couple possibility .
it could be computational somehow fundamentally equivalent to a term machine .
or it could be fundamentally not .
how could it not be ?
it could not be .
a term machine essentially deal with integer whole number some level .
and it can do thing it can add one to a number .
it can do thing this .
it can also store whatever the heck it did .
yes it ha an infinite storage .
but what term one one think about doing physic or idealized physic or idealized mathematics one can deal with real number number with an infinite number of digit .
the number which are absolutely precise and we can say we can take this number and we can multiply it by itself .
are you comfortable with infinity ?
is it context ?
are you comfortable in the context of computation ?
do you think infinity play a part ?
i think that the role infinity is complicated .
and infinity is useful in conceptualizing thing .
it is not actualizable .
almost by definition it is not actualizable .
but do you think infinity is part of the thing that might underlie the law of physic ?
i think that no i think there are many question that you ask about .
you might ask about physic which inevitably involve infinity .
when you say is faster than a light travel possible ?
you could say given the law of physic can you make something even arbitrarily large even quote infinitely large that will make faster than light travel possible ?
then you are throwing into dealing with infinity a a theoretical question .
but talking about whats underneath space and time and what how one can make a computational infrastructure ?
one possibility is that you can not make a computational infrastructure and during such machine sense that you have to be dealing with precise real number you are dealing with partial differential equation which have precise real number that arbitrarily close to separated point .
you have a continuum for everything .
could be that thats what happens .
that there a continuum for everything in precise real number for everything and then the thing i am thinking about are wrong .
thats the risk you take if you are trying to do thing about nature is you might be wrong .
it is not it is for me personally it is a strange thing thatve spent a lot of my life building technology where you can do something that nobody care about but you can not be wrong in that sense .
in the sense you build your technology and it doe what it doe .
you do not get to if the model for the universe is simple you do not get to have a line of code for each of those thing .
you do not get to have the muon case the taulepton case all of those are all have to be emergent some something deeper .
that mean it is inevitable thats a little hard to talk about what the underlying structural structure is .
do you think human being have the cognitive capacity to understand if we are to discover to understand the kind of simple structure from which these law can emerge ?
you think thats a good question .
here what i think .
i think that i am in the middle of this now .
i am telling you that i think you are seeing this human this human ha a hard time understanding a bunch of the thing that are going on .
but but what happens in understanding is one build waypoints .
if you said understand modern 21st century mathematics starting from counting back and whenever counting wa invented fiftyzero year ago whatever it wa ?
that will be difficult .
but what happens is we build waypoints that allow u to get to higher level of understanding .
and we see the same thing happening in language when we invent a word for something it provides a cognitive anchor a a waypoint that let u a podcast or something .
you could be explaining it is a thing which this work this way that way .
they are the way but a soon a you have the word podcast and people society understand it you start to build a build on top of that .
and i think and thats the story of science too .
science is about building these waypoints where we find this cognitive mechanism for understanding something .
let me can build on top of it we have the idea of i do not know differential equation .
we can build on top of that .
we have the side area of that idea .
my hope is that if it is the case that we have to go all the way from the sand to the computer and there no waypoints in between then we are toast .
we will not be able to do that .
eventually we might .
if we are a clevver yap are good enough a billionaire abstract abstraction eventually from sand will get to the computer a. and it is might be a longer journey .
the question is whether it is something that you ask whether our human is going on .
and well quote understand whats going on .
and thats a different question because for that it requires step that are for whether it is from which we can construct a human understandable narrative .
and thats something that i think i am somewhat hopeful that that will be possible although a of today if you ask me i am confronted with thing that i do not understand very .
and this is a small pattern in a computation trying to understand the rule under which the computation function .
and it is the interesting possibility under which kind of computation such a creature can understand itself .
my guess is that within we did not talk much about computational irreducibility but it is a consequence of this principle of computational equivalence .
and it is a core idea that one ha to understand i think which is question is you are doing a computation you can figure out what happens in the computation by running every step in the computation and seeing what happens .
or you can say let me jump ahead and figure out have something smarter that figure out whats going to happen before it happens .
and a lot of traditional science ha been about that act of computational reducibility .
it is weve got these equation and we can solve them .
and we can figure out whats going to happen .
we do not have to trace all of those step .
we jump ahead because we solve these equation .
one of the thing that is a consequence of the principle of computational equivalence is you do not always get to do that .
many many system will be computationally irreducible .
in the sense that the only way to find out what they do is follow each step and see what happens .
why is that ?
if you have if you are saying we with our brain we are a lot smarter we do not have to mess around the little cellular automaton going through and updating all those cell .
we can use the power of our brain to jump ahead .
but if the principle of computational equivalence is thats not going to be correct because it mean that there u doing our computation in our brain .
there a little cellular automaton doing it computation .
and the principle of computational equivalence say these two computation are fundamentally equivalent .
that mean we do not get to say we are a lot smarter than the cellular automaton and jump ahead because we are doing computation thats of the same sophistication a the cellular automaton itself .
thats computational irreducibility is fascinating .
and thats a powerful idea .
i think thats both depressing and humbling and on that while we and cellular automaton are the same .
but the question we are talking about the fundamental law of physic is the reverse question .
you are not predicting whats going to happen .
you have to run the universe for that .
but saying can i understand what rule likely generated me ?
but the problem is to know whether you are you have to have some computational reducibility because we are embedded in the universe .
if the only way to know whether we get the universe is to run the universe we do not get to do that because it ran for fourteen.six billion year or whatever .
and we do not we can not rerun it to speak .
we have to hope that there are pocket of computational reducibility sufficient to be able to say yes i can recognize those are electron there .
and i think that it is a feature of computational irreducibility .
it is a mathematical feature that there are always an infinite collection of pocket of reducibility .
the question of whether they land in the place and whether we can build a theory based on them is unclear .
but to this point about whether we a observer in the universe built out of the same stuff a the universe can figure out the universe to speak .
that relies on these pocket of reducibility .
without the pocket of reducibility it is will not work can not work .
but i think this question about how observer operate .
it is one of the feature of science over the last one hundred year particularly ha been that every time we get more realistic about observer we learn a bit more about science .
for example relativity wa all about observer do not get to say when whats simultaneous with what they have to wait for the light signal to arrive to decide whats simultaneous .
or for example in thermodynamics observer do not get to say the position of every single molecule and a gas .
they can only see the large scale feature .
and thats why the second level of thermodynamics loreventry being increased and on work .
if you could see every individual molecule you wouldnt conclude something about thermodynamics .
you would conclude these molecule all doing these particular thing .
you wouldnt be able to see this aggregate fact .
i strongly expect that and in fact the theory that i have the one ha to be more realistic about the computation and other aspect of observer in order to make a correspondence between what we experience in fact .
they have a my little team and i have a little theory now about how quantum mechanic may work which is a very wonderfully bizarre idea about how threat of human consciousness relates to what we observe in the universe .
but this is the several step to explain what thats about .
what do you make of the mess of the observer at the lower level of quantum mechanic ?
the textbook definition with quantum mechanic say that there some there two world .
one is the world that is and the other is thats observed .
yeah what do you make sense of that ?
i think the idea weve recently had might give away into this .
and thats i do not know yet .
i think thats a mess .
the fact is there is a one of the thing thats interesting and when people look at these model that i started talking about thirty year ago now they say no that compost would be what about quantum mechanic ?
you say tell me what is the essence of quantum mechanic ?
what do you want me to be able to reproduce to know that ive got quantum mechanic speak ?
and that question come up .
we are not quite ready yet .
and one of the question that ive been curious about is if i have five minute with a quantum computer how can i tell if it is a quantum computer or whether it is a simulator at the other end ?
and turn out it is hard .
it turn out there is not it is a lot of these question about what is intelligence whats life .
it is a very task for quantum computer .
and i think the simulation yes exactly .
is it a simulation or is it a quantum computer ?
it is the same a you all over again .
but that term this whole issue about the mathematical structure of quantum mechanic and the completely separate thing that is our experience in which we think definite thing happen but a quantum account it doesnt say definite thing ever happen .
quantum mechanic is all about the amplitude for different thing to happen .
but yet our threat of consciousness operates a if definite thing are happening .
to linger on the point youve mentioned the structure that could underlie everything and this idea that it could perhaps have something the structure of a graph .
you elaborate why your intuition is that there a graph structure of node and edge and what it might represent .
. . the question is what is in a sense the most structural structure you can imagine .
and in fact what ive recently realized in last year or i have a new most structuralist structure .
by the way the question itself is a beautiful and a powerful one in itself .
even without an answer the question is a strong question. . but whats your new idea ?
it ha to do with hypergraphs .
essentially what is interesting about the model i have now is a little bit what happened with computation .
everything that i think of a maybe the model is this .
and thats quite encouraging because it is i could say i am going to look at a trivalent graph with three edge for each node and on .
i could look at this special graph .
i could look at this algebraic structure and turn out that the thing i am now looking at everything that ive imagined that is a plausible type of structuralist structure is equivalent to this .
what is it ?
a typical way to think about it is you might have some collection of tuples collection of let say number .
you might have one three five two three four .
collection of number triple of number let say quadruple of number pair of number whatever .
and you have all these floating little tuples they are not in any particular order .
and that floating collection of tuples and i told you this wa abstract represents the whole universe .
the only thing that relates them is when a symbol is the same it is the same to speak .
if you have two tuples and they contain the same symbol let say at the same position of the tuple the first element of the tuple then that represents a relation .
let me let me try and peel this back .
wow i told you this abstract but this is this is the relationship is formed by the same some aspect of the sameness .
but think about it in term of a graph .
yeah a graph bunch of node let say you number each node .
then what is a graph ?
a graph is a set of pair that say this node ha an edge connecting it to this other node .
thats the thats an graph is a collection of those pair that say this node connects to this other node .
this is a generalization of that in which instead of having pair you have arbitrary end tuples .
thats it thats the whole story .
and now the question is that might represent the state of the universe how doe the universe evolve ?
what doe the universe do ?
and the answer is that what i am looking at is transformation rule on these hypergraphs .
in other word you say this whenever a piece of this hypergraph that look this turn it into a piece of hypergraph that look this .
on a graph it might be when the subgraph when this thing with a bunch of edge hanging out in this particular way then rewrite it a the subgraph. . and thats the whole story .
the question is what now you say think that a i say this is quite abstract .
and one of the question is where do you do those updating ?
youve got this giant graph ?
what trigger the updating ?
whats the whats the ripple effect of it ?
is it yeah and i suspect everythings discrete even in time ? .
the question is what do you do the update ?
and the answer is the rule is you do them wherever they apply .
and you do them you do them the order in which the update is done is not defined .
that is that you can do them .
there may be many possible ordering for these update .
now the point is if imagine you are an observer in the universe .
and you say did something get updated ?
you do not in any sense know until you yourself have been updated. . in fact all that you can be sensitive to is essentially the causal network of how an event over there affect an event thats in you .
thats thats something else .
you are part of the whole thing .
thats your part of it .
but even to have the the end result of that is all your sensitive to is this causal network of what event affect what other event .
i am not making a big statement about the structure of the observer .
i am simply saying i am simply making the argument that what happens the microscopic order of these rewrite is not something that any observer any conceivable observer in the universe can be affected by .
because the only thing the observer can be affected by is this causal network of how the event in the observer are affected by other event that happen in the universe .
the only thing you have to look at is the causal network .
you do not have to look at this microscopic rewrite in the tapining .
these rewrite are happening wherever they they have more wherever they feel .
causal network is there .
you said that there not the idea would be an undefined what get updated the sequence of thing is undefined .
yes thats where you mean by the causal network .
then the causal network is given that an update ha happened .
thats an event .
then the question is is that event cozzly related to doe that event if that event did not happen then some future event couldnt happen yet .
you build up this network of what affect what. ?
and what that doe when you build up that network thats the observable aspect of the universe in such sense .
and then you can ask question about how robust is that observable aspect of whats happening in the universe ?
here where it start getting interesting .
for certain kind of microscopic rewriting rule the order of rewrite doe not matter to the causal network .
and this is mathematical logic moment .
this is equivalent to the church roster property of the confluence property of rewriting rule .
and it is the same reason that if you are simplifying an algebraic expression for example you can say let me expand those term out .
let me factor those piece .
doesnt matter what order you do that in .
youll always get the same answer .
and thats it is the same fundamental phenomenon that cause for certain kind of microscopic rewriting rule the cause the causal network to be independent of the microscopic order of rewriting .
why is that property important ?
because it implies special relativity .
the reason it is important is that that property special relativity say you can look at these different reference frame .
you can have different you can be looking at your notion of what space and what time can be different depending on whether you are traveling at a certain speed depending on whether you are doing this that and the other .
but nevertheless the law of physic are the same .
thats what the principle of special relativity say .
there law of physic are the same independent of your reference frame .
turn out this change of the microscopic rewriting order is essentially equivalent to a change of reference frame or at least there a sub part of how that work thats equivalent to a change of reference frame .
whats surprisingly and for the first time in forever it is possible for an underlying microscopic theory to implies special relativity to be able to derive it .
it is not something you put in a a this is a it is something where this other property causal invariance which is also the property that implies that there a single thread of time in the universe .
it might not be the case that that thats that is the thats what would lead to the possibility of an observer thinking that definite stuff happens .
otherwise youve got all these possible rewriting order and who to say which one occurred .
but with this causal invariance property there a notion of a definite thread of time .
it sound that idea of time even space would be emergent from the system .
no i am not a fundamental part of the fundamental level all youve got is a bunch of node connected by hyper edge or whatever .
there no time there no space thats .
but the thing is that it is imagining imagine you are dealing with a graph .
and imagine you have something a honeycomb graph we have a hex a bunch of hexagon .
that graph and a microscopic level it is a bunch of node connected to other node .
but at a microscopic level you say that look a honeycomb it is lattice .
it look a twodimensional manifold of some kind .
it look a twodimensional thing .
if you connect it differently if you connect all the node one one to another and a linked list type structure then youd say that look a onedimensional space .
but at the microscopic level all these are network with node .
the microscopic level they look something thats one of our familiar kind of space .
and it is the same thing with these hypergraphs .
now if you ask me have i found one that give me threedimensional space the answer is not yet .
we do not know this is one of these thing we are betting against nature to speak .
and i have no way to know .
there are many other property of this system that have a very beautiful and very suggestive .
and we are very elegant of this turn out to be because it is very it is very clean .
you start with nothing and everything get built up .
everything about space everything about time everything about matter .
it is all emergent from the property of this extremely lowlevel system .
and that will be pretty cool if thats the way our universe work .
now do i on the other hand the thing that that i find very confusing is let say we succeed .
let say we can say this particular hypergraphary writing rule give the universe .
run that hypergraphary writing rule for enough time and youll get everything .
youll get this conversation we are having .
youll get everything .
if we get to that point and we look at what is this thing ?
what is this rule that we have that is giving u our whole universe ?
how do we think about that thing ?
let say turn out the minimal version of this and this is cool thing for a language designer me .
the minimal version of this model is a single line of orphan language code .
how doe that help you accept marbling in the beauty and the elegance of the simplicity that creates the universe ?
that doe that help u predict anything ?
not because of the irreducibility .
thats correct .
thats correct but the thing that ha strange to me and i havent wrapped my brain around this yet is one is one keep on realizing that we are not special .
how do we come to get a simple universe when many of the available universe is to speak ?
are incredibly complicated it might be a quintillion character long .
why did we get one of the one thats simple ?
and i havent wrapped my brain around that a soon yet .
if indeed we are in such a simple the universe is such a simple rule a possible that there is something outside of this that we are in a what people call to the simulation ?
there were part of a computation a being explored by a graduate student in alternate universe .
the problem is we do not get to say much about whats outside of the universe because by definition how universe is what we exist with in .
now can we make a almost theological conclusion from being able to know how our particular universe work ?
i do not think that if you ask the question could we relate again to this question about the extraterrestrial intelligence ?
weve got the rule for the universe .
wa it built in on purpose ?
thats the same thing a saying .
we see a signal from that we are receiving from some random star somewhere .
and it is a series of pulse .
and it is a periodic series of pulse .
let say wa that done on purpose ?
can we conclude something about the origin of that series of pulse ?
because it is elegant doe not necessarily mean that somebody created it or that we can even comprehend .
i think it is the ultimate version of the identification of the techno signature question .
the ultimate version of that is wa our universe a piece of technology to speak and how an earth will we know ?
because but itll be it is in the crazy science fiction thing you could imagine you could say somebody going to have there going to be a signature there .
it is going to be made by and .
but there no way we could understand that to speak and it is not clear what that would mean .
because the universe simply this if we find a rule for the universe we are not we are simply saying that rule represents what our universe doe .
we are not saying that that rule is something running on a big computer and making our universe .
it is saying that represents what our universe doe .
and the same sense that law of classical mechanic differential equation whatever they are represent what mechanical system do .
it is not that the mechanical system are somehow running solution to those differential equation .
those differential equation represent in the behavior of those system .
whats the gap in your sense to linger on the fascinating perhaps slightly scifi question ?
whats the gap between understanding the fundamental rule that create universe and engineering a system creating a simulation ourselves ?
youve talked about youve talked about nanoengineering idea that are exciting creating some idea of competition in the physical space .
how hard it is is it a an engineering problem to create the universe once the rule that create it ?
thats an interesting question .
i think the substrate on which should the universe is operating is not a substrate that we have access to .
the only substrate we have is that same substrate that the universe is operating in .
if the universe is a bunch of hypergoss being rewritten then we get to attach ourselves to those same hypergoss being rewritten .
we do not get to and if you ask the question is the code clean ?
is can we write nice elegant code with the efficient algorithm and on ?
thats an interesting question .
how how thats this question of how much computational reduce the ability there is in the system .
but ive seen some beautiful cellular automaton that create copy of itself within itself ?
thats the question whether it is possible to create whether you need to understand the substrate or whether you can yeah .
one of the thing that is one of my slightly scifi thought about the future to speak is now if you pull typical people who say do you think it is important to find the fundamental theory of physic ?
you get because ive done this poll and formally at least it is curious .
you got a decent fraction of people saying yeah that would be pretty interesting .
i think thats becoming surprisingly enough more ive lived a lot of people are interested in physic in a way that with understanding it being scientist a very small number of them struggled to understand the nature of our reality .
i think thats true and in fact in this project that i am launching into to try and find fundamental theory of physic i am going to do it a a very public project it is going to be livestreamed and all this stuff .
i do not know what will happen itll be fun .
i think that it is the interface to the world of this project .
we are talking about the quest to find a fundamental theory of physic .
first point is it is turned out it is hard to find the fundamental theory of physic .
people will not show that that would be the case .
back in the early day of applying mathematics to science 1600s and on people were and one hundred year will know everything there is to know about how the universe work .
turn that to be harder than that .
and people got humble at some level because every time we got to a greater level of smallness and studying the universe it seemed the math got more complicated and everything got harder .
the when i when i wa a kid i started doing particle physic and when i wa doing particle physic i always thought finding the fundamental fundamental theory of physic thats a cookie business will never be able to do that .
but we can operate within these framework that we built for doing quantum field theory and general relativity and thing this and it is all good and we can figure out a lot of stuff .
did you even at that time have a sense that there something behind that ?
i did not expect that i thought in some rather un it is crazy in thinking back on it because it is there wa this long period in civilization where people thought the ancient said it all figured out and well never figure out anything new .
and to some extent thats the way i felt about physic when i wa in the middle of doing it to speak .
wa weve got a quantum field theory it is the foundation of what we are doing and there yes there probably something underneath this but well never figure it out .
but then i started studying simple program and the computational universe thing cellular automator and on and i discovered that there they do all kind of thing that were completely at odds with the intuition that i had had .
and after that after this tiny little program that doe all this amazingly complicated stuff then you start feeling a bit more ambitious about physic and saying maybe we could do this for physic too .
and thats that got me started year ago now in this idea of could we find whats underneath all of these framework quantum field theory and genre or evidence on .
and people perhaps do not realize a close a they might that the framework we are using for physic which is these two thing quantum field theory the theory of small stuff and genre of levitation and large stuff .
those are the two basic theory and there are one hundred year old .
genre of levity wa one thousand nine hundred and fifteen quantum field theory 1920s one hundred year old .
and theyve theyve it is been a good run .
there a lot of stuff been figured out .
but whats interesting is the foundation havent changed in all that period of time .
even though the foundation had changed several time before that in the two hundred year earlier than that .
and i think the kind of thing that i am thinking about which is informed by thinking about computation and the computational universe it is a different foundation .
it is a different set of foundation and might be wrong .
but it is at least we have a shot .
and i think it is to me it is my personal calculation for myself is is if it turn out that the finding the fundamental theory of physic it is low hanging fruit to speak .
itd be a shame if we did not think to do it .
if people said youll never figure that stuff out .
let and it take another two hundred year before anybody get around to doing it .
i think it is i do not know how low hanging this fruit is .
it may be it may be that it is the wrong century to do this project .
i think the the cautionary tale for me i think about thing that ive tried to do in technology where people thought about doing them a lot earlier .
my favorite example is probably livenets who who thought about making essentially encapsulating the world knowledge and a computational form in the late 1600s and did a lot of thing towards that .
and we finally managed to do this but he wa three hundred year too early .
and thats the thats the in term of life planning it is avoid thing that can not be done in your in your century to speak .
yeah timing timing is everything .
you think if we figure out the underlying rule it can create from which quantum field theory in general relativity can emerge do you think theyll help u unify it at that level of abstract ?
i will know it completely .
well know how that will fit together .
yes without a question .
and it is already even the thing ive already done there are very it is very very elegant .
how thing seem to be fitting together now is it ?
i do not know yet .
it is awfully suggestive .
if it is not it is some then the designer of the universe should feel embarrassed to speak because it is a good way to do that .
in your intuition in term of design universe doe god play dice is there is there randomness in this thing or is it deterministic ?
the thats a little bit of a complicated question because when you are dealing with these thing that involve these rewrite that have youve been randomness is an emergent phenomenon perhaps .
it is a yeah randomness in many of these system pseudorandomness and randomness a halt to distinguish .
in this particular case the current idea that we have about some measurement and quantum mechanic is something very bizarre and very abstract and i do not think i can yet explain it without yacking about very technical thing .
eventually i will be able to but if thats if thats it is a it is a weird thing because it is slice between determinism and randomness in a weird way that hasnt been sliced before to speak .
many of these question that come up in science where it is is it this or is it that turn out the real answer is it is neither of those thing it is something different and orthogonal to those those those category .
and thats the current this week idea about how that might work but well well see how that unfolds .
it is difficult in an old field to go back to the foundation and we are think about rewriting them .
it is a lot easier in young field where you are still dealing with the first generation of people who invented the field .
and then in your career and some of the thing youve taken on it feel you are not you havent been afraid of the hard slog .
yeah it is true .
it is it is quite interesting especially on the engineering side and a small tangent when you were a caltech did you get to interact with richard fimer and all you have any of you ?
yeah i am very sure .
we work together quite a bit .
in fact on and in fact both when i wa at caltech and after i left caltech we were both consultant at this company called thinking machine corporation which wa down the street from here .
a ultimately illfated company but i used to say this company is not going to work with the strategy they have and dick fimer always used to say what do we know about running company let them run their company ?
but anyway it wa not into into that thing .
and he always thought that my interest in doing thing running company wa a distraction to speak .
and for me it is a mechanism to have a more effective machine for getting thing figuring thing out and getting thing to happen .
did he think of it ?
because essentially what you used you did with the company i do not know if you were thinking of it that way but you are creating tool to empower your to empower the exploration of the university .
do you think do he that he understands that point ?
that point of tool of i think not a a he might have done .
i think that but he wa my first company which wa also involved with wa involved with more mathematical computation kind of thing .
he wa quite he had lot of advice about the technical side of what we should do and on .
give example of memory of thought .
yeah yeah he had all kind of look in the business of doing one of the hard thing in math is doing integral and on ?
and he had his own elaborate way to do integral and on he had his own way of thinking about getting intuition about how math work .
and his meta idea wa take those intuition or method and make a computer follow those intuition or method .
now it turn out for the most part when we do integral and thing what we do is is we build this bizarre industrial machine that turn every integral into product of mere g function and generates this very elaborate thing .
and the big problem is turning the result into something a human will understand .
it is not quite doing the integral .
turn out the way weve done it is very different from that way .
what do you make of that difference between ?
wouldnt tell everybody about the complicated calculation because he thought that wa easy .
he thought the impressive thing wa to have this simple intuition about how everything work .
he invented that at the end and because hed done this calculation and knew how it worked it wa a lot easier it is a lot easier to have good intuition when what the answer is .
id say i do not understand this i do something with a computer and hed say i do not understand this .
piece of big argument about what wa what wa going on but it wa always some and i think many of the thing that we realized about quantum computing that wa issue that have to do particularly with the measurement process are still issue today .
and i find it interesting it is a funny thing in science that these there a remarkable happens in technology too there a remarkable repetition of history that end up occurring .
eventually thing get nailed down but it often take a while and it often thing come back decade later .
for example i could tell a story happened down the street from here .
when we were both at thinking machine i had been working on this particular cellulautomotom called rule thirty that ha this feature that it from very simple initial condition it make complicated behavior .
print this out lot of very tiny cell and there wa a question of how some feature of that pattern and it wa very much a physical on the floor with meter rule trying to measure different thing .
a feynman take me aside weve been doing that for a while and take me aside and he say i want to know this one thing .
he say i want to know how did that this rule thirty thing would produce all this complicated behavior that is complicated that we are going around with this big printout and on ?
and i said i did not know .
i enumerated all the possible rule and then observed that thats what happened is that i feel a lot better .
i thought you had some intuition that he did not have that would let one i said no no no no intuition experimental science .
thats such a beautiful dichotomy there of thats exactly you show is you can not have an intuition about it and you are reduce you will you have to run u . yes thats .
thats all hard for our human and especially brilliant physicist feynman to say that you can not have a compressed clean intuition about how the whole thing work .
yes he wa i think he wa on the edge of understanding that point about computation and i think he found that that he always found computation interesting and i think that wa what he wa a little bit poking at .
that intuition the difficulty of discovering thing even you say you enumerate all the case and find one that doe something interesting ?
sound very easy .
turn out i missed it when i first saw it because i had an intuition that said it shouldnt be there .
i had argument i am going to ignore that case because whatever .
and how did you have an open mind enough because you are essentially the same person a your fact the same physic type of thinking how did you find yourself having a sufficiently open mind to be open to watching rule and them revealing complexity ?
yeah i think this interesting question .
ive wondered about that myself because it is you live through these thing and then you say what wa the historical story ?
and sometimes the historical story that you realize after the fact wa not what you lived through to speak .
and what i realized is i think what happened is i did physic reductionistic physic where you are throwing the universe and you are told go figure out whats going on inside it .
and then i started building computer tool and i started building my first computer language for example .
and a computer language is not it is physic in the sense that you have to take all those computation people want to do and drill down and find the primitive that they can all be made of .
but then you do something is different because you are saying these are the primitive .
now hopefully theyll be useful to people .
let build up from there .
you are essentially building an artificial universe in a sense where you make this language youve got these primitive you are building whatever you feel building .
and thats and it wa interesting for me because from doing science where you are throwing the universe a the universe is to then being told you can make up any universe you want .
and i think that experience of making a computer language which is essentially building your own universe to speak is thats the thats what gave me a somewhat different attitude towards what might be possible .
it is let explore what can be done in these artificial universe rather than thinking the natural science way of let be constrained by how the universe is .
but there something fundamentally different between a computer and a telescope .
it yeah i am hoping that i can romanticize the notion but it is more general .
it is more general .
and it is it is i think this point about people say such and such a thing wa almost discovered at such and such a time .
the the distance between the building the paradigm that allows you to understand stuff or allows one to be open to seeing whats going on .
thats hard .
and i think in ive been fortunate in my life that i spent a lot of my time building computational language .
and thats an activity that in a sense work by having to create the other level of abstraction and be open to different kind of structure .
what do you think is the role of ego in the history of math and science ?
and more a book title something a new science youve accomplished a huge amount .
and in fact somebody said that newton did not have an ego and i looked into it and he had a huge ego .
yeah but from an outsider perspective some of said that you have a bit of an ego a . do it that way doe ego get in the way ?
is it empowering ?
is it both ?
it is it is it is complicated .
and thats a story .
ive had look ive spent more than half my life ceo in your tech company .
it may be that if ive been an academic for example i could have checked the ego put it on put it on a shelf somewhere and ignore it characteristic but you are reminded of it quite often in the context of running a company .
thats what it is about .
it is about leadership and leadership is intimately tied to ego .
now what doe it mean ?
what what is the for me ive been fortunate that i think i have reasonable intellectual confidence to speak .
that is i i am one of these people who at this point if somebody tell me something down under standard my conclusion is not that mean i am dumb that my conclusion is there something wrong with what i am being told .
and that wa a bit fun and you used to have that that feature too he never believed in .
he believed in expert much le than i believe in expert .
the result of i am pretty sure i am and turn out i am not .
how am i going to be able to do this ?
and i wa fortunate in the sense that i happened to start having some degree of success in science and thing when i wa young and that developed a certain amount of intellectual confidence i do not think i otherwise would have had .
in the reason i i immediately understood the ego behind and you science .
to me try to express my feeling and the whole thing is that if you do not allow that ego then you would never write that book that you would say people must have done this .
and i think that wa i think you have to take that ego and ride it and see where it take you .
and thats how you create exceptional work .
but i think the other point about that book wa it wa a nontrivial question how to take a bunch of idea that i think reasonably big idea they might their importance is determined by what happens historically .
when can not tell how important they are one can tell the scope of them .
and the scope is fairly big .
and they are very different from thing that have come before .
and the question is how do you explain that stuff to people ?
and i had had the experience of saying there are these thing there a seller a tomaton it doe this it doe that .
and people are it must be this .
it must be that .
it is not .
it is something different .
you could have done i am glad you did what you did but you could have done academically you published keep publishing small paper here and there .
and then you would keep getting this resistance ?
you would get it is supposed to drop a thing that say here it is .
here the full thing .
no that wa my calculation .
it is you could introduce little piece thats one possibility is it is the secret weapon to speak .
it is this i keep on discovering these thing and all these different area where they come from .
but i decided that in the interest of one only ha one life to lead them the writing that book took me a decade .
anyway it is not there not a lot of wiggle room to speak one can not be wrong by a factor of three .
you talk about ego and it is for example i run a company which ha my name on it ?
i thought about starting a club for people who company have their name on them .
it is it is a funny group because we are not a bunch of ego maniac .
thats not what it is about to speak .
it is about taking responsibility for what one doing .
i also happen to be a pretty strong leader of it but showing a deep inextricable investment the same your name steve job name wasnt on on on apple but he wa apple .
he lost .
he lost .
his name is not on tesla but he is tesla .
it is meaning emotionally it is it is it is company successor fails .
he would that emotionally he would suffer through that .
and thats thats thats a good recognizing that fact tonight .
and also wolfram is a pretty good branding name that it work out .
yeah id to exactly .
steve had it how to how to how to deal that .
yeah you you made up for it with the last name. . in two thousand and two you published a new science to which on a personal level i can credit my love for cellular tom and computation in general .
i think a lot of others can a . can you briefly describe the vision the hope the main idea presented in this twelvehundredpage book ?
although it took one thousand two hundred page to say in the book .
no the the real idea it is a good way to get into it is to look at the arc of history and to look at whats happened in the development of science .
there wa this big idea in science about three hundred year ago that wa let use mathematical equation to try and describe thing in the world .
let use the formal idea of mathematical equation to describe what might be happening in the world rather than for example using logical augmentation and on .
let have a formal theory about that .
and thereve been this three hundredyear run of using mathematical equation to describe the natural world which will work pretty .
but i got interested in how i could generalize that notion .
there is a formal theory .
but what structure could those rule have .
and what i got interested in wa let generalize beyond the purely mathematical rule .
and we now have this notion of programming and computing and on .
let use the kind of rule that can be embodied in program to a a generalization of the one that can exist in mathematics a a way to describe the world .
and my favorite version of these kind of simple rule are these thing called cellular automaton and typical case shall wait .
what are cellular automaton ?
fair enough .
typical case of a cellular automaton .
it is an array of cell .
it is a line of discrete cell .
each cell is either black or white .
and in a series of step you can represent a line going down a page .
you are updating the color of each cell according to a rule that depends on the color of the cell above it and to it left and .
it is simple .
a thing might be if the cell and it neighbor are not the same and or the cell on the left is black or something then make it black on the next step and if not make it white .
that rule i am not sure i said it exactly but a rule very much what i said ha the feature that if you start it off from one black cell at the top .
it make this extremely complicated pattern .
some rule you get a very simple pattern .
some rule you have the rule a simple .
you start them off from a simple seed .
you get this very simple pattern .
but other rule and this wa the big surprise when i started doing the simple computer experiment to find out what happens is that they produce very complicated pattern of behavior .
for example this rule thirty rule ha the feature you start it from one black cell at the top .
make this very random pattern .
if you look at the center column of cell you get a series of value it go black white black black whatever it is .
that sequence seems for all practical purpose random .
it is in math you compute the digit of pi three.one million four hundred and fifteen thousand nine hundred and twenty six whatever .
those digit once computed the scheme for computing pi it is the ratio of this conference in amateur of a circle very defined but yet when you are once youve generated those digit they seem for all practical purpose completely random .
and it is with rule thirty .
that even though the rule is very simple much simpler much more computationally obvious than the rule for generation digit of pi even with a rule that simple you are still generating immensely complicated behavior .
yeah if we could pause on that i think you probably said it and looked at it long you forgot the magic of it or perhaps you do not you still feel the magic .
but to me if youve never seen i would say what is it ?
a onedimensional essentially another time ?
and you were to guess what you would see if you have some cell that only respond to it neighbors. ?
if you were to guess what thing you would see my initial guess even when i first open your book and you said it is ?
my initial guess is you would see it would be a very simple stuff .
and i think it is a magical experience to realize the complex you mentioned rule thirty still your favorite cellular atomic atomic all my favorite rule yes .
you get complexity immense complexity .
you get arbitrary complexity .
and when you say randomness down the middle column thats one cool way to say that there incredible complexity .
and thats thats a magical idea .
however you start to interpret it all the reproducibility discussion all that .
but it is i think that ha profound philosophical notion around the two .
it is not no it is transformational about how the world .
i think for me it wa transformational .
for some reason it is a deeply profound notion at least .
i find it that way .
yeah look it is been it wa a very intuitionbreaking thing to discover .
it is you point the computational telescope out there and suddenly i do not know in the past it is moon of jupiter or something .
but suddenly something thats very unexpected and rule thirty wa very unexpected for me .
and the big challenge at a personal level wa to not ignore it .
people in other word you might say it is a bug .
what would you say yeah what would you say ?
yeah what are we looking at by the way ?
i wa generating here ill generate a rule thirty pattern .
thats the rule for rule thirty and it say for example it say here if you have a black cell in the middle and black cell to the left and white cell to the and the cell on the next step will be white .
and here the actual pattern that you get starting off from a single black cell at the top there .
and then thats the initial state initial condition .
thats the initial thing .
you start off from that and then you are going down the page and every at every step you are applying this rule to find out the new value that you get .
and you might think rule that simple you got to get some trace of that simplicity here .
well run it let say for four hundred step .
what it doe it is aliasing a bit on the screen there but you can see there a little bit of regularity over on the left but there a lot of stuff here that look very complicated very random .
and thats a big shock to it wa a big shock to my intuition at least that thats possible .
the amount immediately start is there a pattern and there must be a repair to a pattern .
yeah it must be a pattern .
i spent indeed thats what i thought at first .
and i thought i thought this is interesting but if we run it long enough well see something will resolve into something simple .
and i did all kind of analysis of using mathematics statistic cryptography whatever to try and crack it .
and i never succeeded .
and after i hadnt succeeded for a while i started thinking maybe there a real phenomenon here that is the reason i am not succeeded .
maybe the thing that for me wa a motivating factor wa looking at the natural world and seeing all this complexity that exists in the natural world the question were doe it come from ?
if we look at the newton apple wa there wa there you took a walk and something it profoundly hit you or wa it a gradual thing allows me to think that there truth the truth of every science discovery is it is not that gradual .
ive spent i happen to be interested in scientific biography kind of thing and ive tried to track down how do people come to figure out this or that thing ?
and there always a long preparatory there a need to be prepared in a mindset in which it is possible to see something .
in the case of rule thirty i rose around june one one thousand nine hundred and eighty four wa some a silly story in some way .
i finally had a highresolution laser printer .
i thought thats a possible thing .
i did not know if it is correct .
still i am not sure that it is correct but it is a gradual thing that these thing gradually become seem more important than one thought .
i think the whole idea of studying the computational universe of simple program it took me probably a decade a decade and a half to internalize that that wa an important idea .
and i think if it turn out we find the whole universe looking out there in the computational universe thats a good it is a good bounty point to something for the for the whole idea .
but i think that the the thing thats strange in this whole question about finding this different raw material for making model of thing .
whats been interesting in the in arc of history is for three hundred year it is the mathematical equation approach .
it wa the winner .
it wa the thing you want to have a good model for something thats what you use .
the thing thats been remarkable is in the last decade or i think one can see a transition to using not mathematical equation but program a the raw material for making model of stuff .
and thats pretty neat .
and it is a somebody who lived inside this paradigm shift to speak it is bizarre .
no doubt in the history of science that will be seen a an instantaneous paradigm shift .
but it sure is not instantaneous when it is played out in one actual life to speak ?
and i think thats been watching that process ha been interesting .
i am i am i think i am fortunate that ive i do stuff mainly because i doing it .
and if i wa that make me thickskinned about the world response to what i do .
and but thats definitely in any time you write a book called something a new science it is the pitchfork will come out for the old science .
and i wa it wa interesting dynamic .
i think that the i have to say that i wa fully aware of the fact that the when inscipient paradigm shift in science the bigger of the negative response upon early introduction is a fantastic positive indicator of good longterm result .
in other word if people do not care it is thats not such a good sign .
if they are this is great .
that mean you did not discover anything interesting .
what fascinating property of rule thirty have you discovered over the year ?
youve recently announced the rule thirty prize for solving three key problem .
can you maybe talk about interesting property that have been revealed rule thirty or other cellular time ?
and what problem are still before u the three problem youve announced ?
the most interesting thing about cellular automaton is that it is hard to figure stuff out about them .
and thats some in a sense every time you try and you try and bash them with some other technique you say can i crack them ?
the answer is they seem to be uncrackable .
they seem to have the feature that they are that they are showing irreducible computation .
they are not you are not able to say i know exactly what this is going to do .
it is going to do this or that .
but there some specific formulation of that fact .
for example in rule thirty in the pattern you get starting from a single black cell you get this very very random looking pattern .
and one feature of that look at the center column .
and for example we use that for a long time to generate randomness in both language .
what rule thirty produce .
now the question is can you prove how random it is ?
for example one very simple question can you prove it in the level of heat ?
we havent been able to show that it will never repeat .
we know that if there are two adjacent column we know they can not both repeat .
but knowing whether that center column can ever repeat we still do not even know that .
another problem that i put in my collection of it is thirtyzero for three for these three prize for about rule thirty i would say that this is not one of those this is one of those case where the money is not the main point .
but it is help some motivate somehow that the investigation .
there three problem you propose .
you get thirtyzero if you solve all three or maybe yeah .
no it is tenzero for each. . my the problem is thats .
money is not the thing .
the problem is it is clean the formulation is well never become periodic .
second problem is are there an equal number of black and white cell down the middle column ?
down the middle column .
and the third problem is a little bit harder to state which is essentially is there a way of figuring out what the color of a cell at position t down the center column is in a with a le computational effort than about t step .
is there a way to jump ahead and say i know what this is going to do .
it is some mathematical function of t or proving that there is no way or proving there is no way .
but both for any one of these one could prove that one could discover we know what rule thirty doe for billion step .
but and maybe well know for trillion step before too very long .
but maybe at a quadrillion step it suddenly becomes repetitive .
you might say how could that possibly happen ?
but when i wa writing up these prize i thought and this is typical of what happens in the computational universe i thought let me find an example where it look it is going to be random forever but it becomes repetitive .
and i found one and it is i did a search i searched i do not know maybe a million different rule with some criterion .
and this is whats interesting about that is i have this thing that i say in a silly way about the computational universe which is the animal are always smarter than you are .
that is there always some way one of these computational system is going to figure out how to do something even though i can not imagine how it is going to do it .
but whether equivalently yes marry .
thats correct .
and that make it that make one feel very it is humbling every time because every time the thing is you think it is going to do this .
it is not going to be possible to do this and it turn out it find a way .
of course the problem is think thing is there a lot of other rule rule thirty .
it is rule thirty is always my favorite because i found it first and thats .
but the problem are focusing on rule thirty is possible that rule thirty is is is repetitive after trillion step .
and that doesnt prove anything about the other rule .
it doe not but this is a good experiment of how you go about trying to prove something about it .
yes take the rule .
and it also all these thing helped build intuition .
that is exactly .
if it turned out that this wa repetitive after trillion step thats not what i would expect .
and we learned something from that .
the method to do that though would reveal something interesting about the no doubt .
it is although it is sometimes challenging the i put out a prize in two thousand and seven for for a particular touring machine that i there wa the simplest candidate for being the universal touring machine .
and the young chape in england named alex smith after a smallish number of month said ive got a proof and he did i took a little while to iterate but how to prove unfortunately the proof is very it is it is a lot of micro detail .
it is it is not it is not you look at it and you say aha there a big new principle .
the big new principle is the simplest touring machine that might have been universal is universal .
and it is incredibly much simpler than the touring machine that people already knew were universal before that .
and that intuitionally is important because it say competition universality is closer at hand than you might have thought .
but the actual method are not in that particular case but not terribly luminous .
it would be nice if the method would also be elegant .
thats true .
yeah no i think it is one of these thing where it is a lot of weve talked about earlier opening up ai and machine learning and thing of whats going on inside .
and is it is it step by step or can you see the bigger picture of more abstractly ?
and then fortunate with vermas last theorem proof it is unfortunate that the proof to such an elegant theorem is not it is not it doesnt write into the margin of a page .
thats true .
but one of the thing is thats another consequence of computational or irreducibility .
this fact that there are even quite short result in mathematics whose proof are long .
yes thats a thats a consequence of all the stuff .
and it is it is a it make one wonder how come mathematics is possible at all ?
why is why is it the case how people manage to navigate doing mathematics through looking at thing where they are not thrown into it is all understandable .
thats thats it own own separate separate story .
and that would be that would have a poetic beauty to it is if people were to find something interesting about rule thirty because there an emphasis to this particular role .
it wouldnt say anything about the broad irreducibility of all computation but it would never last put a few smile on people face of yeah .
but to me it is in a sense establishing principal computational equivalence it is a little bit doing inductive science anywhere .
that is the more example you find the more convinced you are that it is generally true .
we do not get to whenever we do natural science we we say it is true here that this or that happens can we can we prove that it is true everywhere in the universe ?
no we can not .
it is the same thing here .
we are exploring the computational universe .
we are establishing fact in the computational universe .
and thats thats a way of of inductively concluding general thing .
weve implied that discussion of physic underlying everything but we we talked about the potentially equivalent of the fundamental law of physic and the computation going on in tournament machine .
but can you now connect that do you think there something special or interesting about the computation that our body do ?
let talk about brain primarily .
i think the most important thing about the thing that our brain do are that we care about them .
in the sense that there a lot of computation going on out there in cellular tomaheter and physical system and on and it it doe what it doe .
it follows those rule it doe what it doe .
the thing thats special about the computation in our brain is that it is connected to our goal and our current whole societal story .
i think thats the special feature .
and now the question then is when this whole ocean of computation out there how do you connect that to the thing that we human care about ?
in a sense a large part of my life ha been involved in the technology of how to do that .
what ive been interested in is building computational language that allows that something that both we human can understand and that can be used to determine computation that are computation we care about .
i think when you look at something one of these cellular automaton and it doe some complicated thing you say thats fun but why do i care ?
you could say the same thing in physic .
you say ive got this material and it is a ferrite or something .
it is some ha some magnetic property .
it is amusing but why do i care ?
we end at caring because ferrite is whats used to make magnetic tape magnetic disk whatever or we could use the crystal .
it is made used to make not that should increasingly not but it ha been used to make computer display and on .
but those are in a sense we are mining these thing that happen to exist in the physical universe and i am making it be something that we care about because we entrain it into technology .
and it is the same thing in the computational universe that a lot of whats out there is stuff thats happening but sometimes we have some objective and we will go and mine the computational universe for something thats useful for some particular objective .
the thing that ive been excited about recently which i had only realized recently which is embarrassing but it is the the arc of what weve tried to do in building this computational language is it is a similar arc of what happened when mathematical notation wa invented .
go back four hundred year people were trying to do math they were always explaining their math and word and it wa pretty conkey and a soon a mathematical notation wa invented you could start defining thing algebra and later calculus and on and all became much more streamlined .
now we have a computational language which allows u to start talking about the world computationally and let u my view of it is it is computational x for all x all these different field of computational this computational that thats what we can now build .
first of all the mundane what is wolf from language in term of i can answer the question for you but it is not the philosophical deep to profound the impact of it .
i am talking about in term of tool in term of thing you can download and play with what is it what is it been into the infrastructure what are the different way to interact with it ?
it is very there a symbolic yeah it is a symbolic language a symbolic language i do not know how to clean the express that but that make it very distinct from how we think about i do not know programming in a language python or something .
loop which is weve done a lot of stuff natural language understanding using essentially not learning based method using a lot of out the logarithmic method human curation method and on i am people try to enter a query and then converting the process of converting n.l.u .
hello and welcome to another podcast from odell technology .
today we are very fortunate to be joined by the cofounder and ceo of upfront diagnostics .
morning stephen .
thank you much for having me at your podcast .
odell i wa wondering if you could tell u a little bit about your background and how you ended up where you are today .
yeah we started in two thousand and seventeen .
my brother wa living in cambridge .
he wa developing pointofcare device for one of the main manufacturer of lateral flow in the uk .
and i wa studying marketing at the university in spain .
and then yeah my brother had the idea of he wanted to create a company in diagnostics .
and we found that there were no any stroke black test in the market .
we thought that it wa a great market opportunity although it wa a massive challenge .
but we decided to move to cambridge and we started up from diagnostics .
and then we met the third cofounder dr. eduardo gauden who is a phd from the university .
thats how we all started .
but we had this idea of starting the company .
we were in the climbing world in cambridge and thats how we met eduardo and thats how the company started six year ago .
now tell me what doe the diagnostic do ?
the problem with a stroke is that there are many different type .
and each type of a stroke need to be treated at a specialized centre .
for example in england there are only twenty four hospital that can deliver the specific neurosurgical procedure for a type of stroke known a large vessel occlusion which represents around a third of all stroke but they contribute to over ninety five of these ability and death .
what we develop is a rapid test very very similar to the covid test .
it take a few minute and paramedic bring this test with them and it help them to identify those large vessel occlusion on the spot and then redirect those patient to those specialized centre without having to go to a hospital without the specific treatment .
and this save around one hundred minute to treatment which is the difference between life and death .
it is personalized medicine is not it ?
yeah yeah correct .
it is what they call precision medicine .
and you are also your streamlined and care pathway you are introducing cost efficiency .
tell me have you got good case study of the system far ?
yeah weve done different study .
here in the uk we did a very large clinical trial in collaboration with newcastle university under an innovate uk grant .
we tested more than three hundred patient and we achieved very very positive result .
then we replicated the result in the u . we did a study in collaboration with the hospital in florida and we are publishing the result now in a few week .
thats quite exciting .
and currently we are testing the device in five hospital in the uk .
we are testing the device in the northeast of england in newcastle northumbria and then we are also testing the device in london .
there are emergency department today testing and using the device .
thats fantastic .
is it better that a paramedic ha the test or is it better that an emergency department ha the test ?
it can be both but usually it is paramedic since thats where you can save more time to treatment .
it is all about how long it take to the patient to ride to the centre .
there is value for the test to be in the emergency department but the sooner you spot the stroke even at the home of the patient the sooner the patient will get to the specialised centre .
it can be used in different stage of the stroke .
now the company is based in cambridge in the uk correct ?
yeah we are in the biomedical campus in cambridge very close to big company astrazeneca or upcom .
we know it will .
i think that what youve been able to achieve in a very short space of time is remarkable .
the test itself is a point of care test it can be done in any setting .
how long doe the test take to perform ?
thank you stephen for that question .
now the result we have is between ten and fifteen minute and thats the time to diagnose it .
it can be lower sometimes but then fifteen minute is the maximum .
thats fantastic .
thats going to save somebody life .
and then of course youve got different way of treating different stroke and thats the pathway you are talking about .
i wasnt aware of twenty four hospital in the uk .
thats fascinating .
i do not think many people would be aware of that .
in cambridge for example in all east anglia we only have adam brook cambridge who can treat lbo patient .
in london we have a few more hospital but then the more you go up the le specialized center that you have .
in place wale scotland there are many patient from wale and scotland that are transferred to england for receiving treatment .
and the same problem happened in the u . in the u only three of hospital can give this specialized treatment .
it is because there are not many specialized doctor that can deliver this type of treatment .
and also you need to have very specialized equipment it is not widely spread .
and the other problem is that there are no plan to increase the amount of those center .
there is no plan from the nh to increase the amount of center that will deliver this treatment .
the only way to improve the care is to have earlier diagnosis .
thats the only way. . now the company received some funding over the last several year .
can you tell me something about the funding ?
yeah in total weve received around three and a half million pound .
we have secured a very large uk grant a few year ago .
and then last year the nh and the stroke association and sbri provided u with a one.one million contract to implement this technology in the nh .
and also we have institutional investor venture capital mainly the university of cambridge and apex venture which is a very known vc in bayesian austria that work in metec .
apex venture is quite an interesting company .
now is there something youd to talk about in particular ?
i think that a bit of how we got here no ?
i think that for u it wa very important to involve clinician from the beginning .
you think that healthcare startup need to work with professional clinician from the beginning .
and that wa part of our journey .
before we start any development and any research we started working with the team in newcastle university .
and we asked them no lie what do you want ?
which type of tool will help you to give a better care to patient ?
and they told u that we are starting to have this problem with stroke patient .
it will be fantastic to have a tool that could tell u in the ambulance what type of stroke is the patient suffering ?
i think something that we learned from experience is that talking to doctor doesnt cost money .
you do not need to raise any investment to do that .
and i think thats a very important part because when you start development you can not go backwards .
when you start to do trial and to develop a device you need to know what you are doing .
i think the sooner you start talking to professional clinician doctor nurse paramedic patient the le chance of doing something wrong you will have .
involve the let say and this applies to any industry involve your customer since they won .
and this doesnt cost any money .
you do not need to raise million to do that .
you need to spend the time and also be open to be challenged .
i think that you need to have an open mind and do not try to have all the answer but try to ask the question .
i think thats super important .
what challenge have you encountered in the last several year while you are doing while you are setting up this business ?
it is hard to mention all of them .
i would say that in the first one is finding the market fit .
there are many different type of test that you could develop .
finding the one that wa going to make a difference wa hard because the one that were very clear that will make a difference were already developed .
and then the one that were novel the client or the customer will not understand them .
you need to pick something that wa very novel but at the same time no one wa doing it .
i wa going to be accepted by the market .
and then the second i think is fundraising especially during covid .
there wa a moment during covid where we were in a bad situation because there wa no capital available for u . although there wa capital no there wa definitely people raising money but in our case we were stuck at our home .
we were doing our clinical trial we did not have any data yet .
and there wa a moment where it wa very hard to manage our cash flow .
those two thing were the most difficult i think market fit and fundraising .
but if you look at data thats the main two challenge that every startup ha .
and those are the main two cause of company to disappear .
market fit fundraising is always the no there are other problem but yeah .
can you tell me something about the diagnostic accuracy or the diagnostic precision sensitivity specificity of the test ?
yeah absolutely .
we have published data in the public journal the data is publicly available .
and we can share the detail afterwards for people to go and look at them .
but the data weve achieved is a ninety five accuracy for identification of large basal occlusion with eighty six sensitivity ninety eight specificity .
we are very good at finding the patient that have an lvo .
when you transfer a patient to one of those specialized center you want to be almost sure that you have an lvo because it is not only the patient who is moving to a different hospital it is also the family of the patient .
they need to do a longer travel .
and there are many factor that will affect their life .
you need to be very careful when you make those type of decision .
tell me have you looked at the cost efficiency of this an exercise the health economic ?
the weve done an exercise nh ha done an exercise for u and we could save four hundred and fortyzero pound for every one thousand patient that received the test .
there is a huge cost saving .
there are one hundred and fiftyzero new stroke every year .
if you multiply the cost are around seventy to eighty million per year which is massive .
and also you need to help them to continue with their life .
obviously there is a massive direct cost saving that but also indirect .
no absolutely .
i think it ha a enormous budget impact effect on a lot of operation particularly integrated care system .
is there anything else youd to mention ?
i think that talking about venture capital in medtech which i think is different from other market in other industry especially software generating revenue at least is doable .
while in our world let call it our bubble started to generate revenue it take a lot of time because you need to go through a very lengthy process .
there are way of showing traction to those investor that you will make it but until you start generating revenue is a high risk for them .
the problem that they have venture capital i think in this space is that if they do not if they invest too early they are taking a lot of risk and maybe they lose their money .
but if they wait too long then those company start generating revenue they can start having deal with the strategic company the rush the adult the big company and that put them out of the scope .
it is very hard for venture capital in medtech to make the decision because they need to balance the risk with missing an opportunity .
i think it is a very different world from i think it happens also in life science not therapeutic but there is definitely a challenge for venture capital in medtech because there are too there are we are too many and it is hard to pick the one .
but if you arrive too late then you do not have an opportunity to get a piece of the cake .
i think that there is a challenge in venture capital in medtech that i think with all the university of cambridge incubator all these sign all these thing that are creating traction is reducing the risk for them .
but anyway i think it is a it is a different type of investment .
yeah i think that for u the challenge is how to prove that we are going to be the one making it .
although there are there are thing that you can collect and you can show that that that will happen to say i think the upfront i think is the one .
have you started generating revenue at this point in time ?
we have secure contract with the nh .
it is nonrecurrent revenue it is a oneoff payment .
but we will start generating revenue very soon .
we will start compensating probably early next year .
yeah we are we are we are very close to get the approval and start revenue .
yeah we are getting there .
and where wa the kid manufactured ?
shes manufactured in england .
we are collaborating with a third party and they have a manufacturer inside with ninety employee .
ive enjoyed talking to you today and i hope to talk to you again in another six month time .
you are making a big difference .
i havent got a problem with it a long a you do not come anywhere near me .
probably one of the biggest thing in the last ten year .
it wa absolute game changer .
all the time .
it is part of it .
mate dale tell me about that .
there nothing i wouldnt say to alies face .
do you want to start by apologising for the sound on the last one ?
candid are we rolling ?
yeah we will apologise to everyone for the sound .
whose fault wa it ?
it wa not my fault .
i wa talking to the mic the whole thing .
it wa wilksie the man that wa in charge of the sound .
he done it again .
he done it again .
he wasnt in charge very .
thats whose fault it wa .
we are going to try our best not to ruin the sound this time .
here we are .
no i wa ... we have got plan in place to slightly rejig the set up to make it visually more pleasing and a bit more comfortable looking .
hopefully with that the new sound will be better anyway .
yeah i think itd be good. . but the good thing is everyones enjoying them .
shes obviously great .
everyone seems to the concept .
the uncut rawness of chatting away and putting it all out there no matter what get discussed .
i think it is going to be a long liveem .
hopefully they can carry on and ... yeah yeah of course .
it sound good enough .
more people might watch .
weve got a ... i think we are going to touch on at the beginning some success that a couple of u have had recently fishing .
you want to bring up your fishing do not you ?
no i said we would because i had a good fishing trip last week one of our sponsored angler and spooners had a few carp in the last couple of week .
we can talk about that .
but then we are also going to get into a question thats been sent in .
the one question i am hoping is going to be enough to last this podcast .
i think it can spin off in load of different direction .
i think perhaps well pas over to spooner and talk about what he been up to last week or .
talk for a couple of your carp .
yeah nice couple of trip .
it wa up at norton disney with all of the salesman from across europe and the uk .
it looked fun that .
first time the european boy have been over to ... a lot of them to catch their first ever english carp and to come and see the quartertales .
nice timing for one of my bite .
id done the night the uk boy were turning up and theyve all rocked up in me swim .
i am making multiple cup a day and i had me sense ... which is rare for you mate .
i do not think ive had a cup of tea off you this year .
thats not true .
thats whats happened .
ive always been good .
and now because you make the odd cup you think you are terri earned .
i turned the sensitivity down on my dale kims load because through the night i had a couple of rat running into the bobbin .
i wa fishing quite slack line .
i knew that any beep on them wa probably a fish on the end .
a everyones around i couldnt see my rod i had a single bleep and a i looked around the corner bobbin off tip pulling down .
cool battle with a carp done me multiple weed bed but got it all the way back in .
after what i thought wa going to be one of those few little growons that have got a fifteen pound and it wa erratic the fight i wa convinced it wa one of them .
turn out to be a fifty .
no still hasnt happened but it wa a common of over thirty nine pound .
and then a few hour later i had another bite .
there you go .
cool yeah nice fish .
pettits is getting some big fishing now is not it ?
it is getting there .
do what ?
we worked it out the other day .
there about one hundred and eighty to two hundred carp and probably one hundred of them are over thirty pound .
thats quite insane .
thats good .
yeah and recently in fact the guy that moved in after me he wa on a bit of a social with a load of his mate .
he had one bite at the def new complex record forty sixtwelve .
physical shoulder .
i saw the picture .
it is also become it doe a lot more bite now a doesnt it ?
all of used to be the one where i think it wa quite hard .
all of used to be people used to go out there and struggle .
it probably is for you but i think most people ... no it all seems to be the one ... no it is the trickiest lake on the venue per acre .
there le carp in there than any others but thats why youve got many biggings in there now .
is that the biggest common in the lake ?
again about a couple of week before that one it did it first fortypound common .
i think there nine forty in there now .
is it ?
there a forty three common .
it is a special lake .
i had another bite from there i said a couple of hour later and it wa another thirtypounder .
it is a good thing a that dans opening it up for a vip fee .
yeah he is .
is it three hundred quid for the whole winter ?
thats not bad .
thats good .
that is good .
ive always thought that thing is appealing because youve only got to do that with a mate or another mate share the driving go twice for a decent length session for four night .
it is worth it weight in gold doing that is not it ?
they do it at wolvenstowe a i think at the winter ticket .
and a few other place .
they are worth it if you are going to stay fishing all winter obviously .
i think thatll give a lot of people the inspiration though .
youve got a long a you do nine night through the winter youve paid for your ticket and then you start to effectively make money you are earning out of it .
and it allows you to get into tune with a lake .
i think a lot of people when they pop to a day ticket you are doing the odd trip but if you decide you are going to spend your three hundred quid thats effectively your winter syndicate .
therell be a lot more carport and catch yourself a big in an allnighter .
if the weather stay this it is going to be a good winter .
thats insane is not it ?
it is going to carry on .
youve got to be careful about the syndicate mentality .
a water that normally ha got such a high turnover of people .
you do not often see the same person twice .
you end up with something where you end up probably exchanging a few number .
you can keep in the loop with a venue normally youd know nothing about until you rocked out there .
thats quite good .
where wa it you got after then ?
i went to the youtube been to .
the guy we met at a carp show a guy called dean doug alake in his back garden .
i went and had a go on there .
i fished solid bag of maggot with a few swad of maggot over the top and only had one bite but again at a real nice thirty six for scaly one .
look at that .
thats nice is not it ?
we want to run of decent not luck but you are getting some good one .
that would be a good reading .
that is true .
ive always said it .
i am going tomorrow night a . ive got lot of fishing next week i am hoping that little run can continue .
you going back down there ?
he got some nice fish in there is not he ?
he got some nice stuff in there .
it is one of those .
where are you going then ?
i did a friend of ours when stomper passed away .
we did a charity thing to raise a bit of money for his family .
and one of the guy who wa due to fish it last year i think he got a new job and couldnt do it it is a rearrange trip .
we asked him on there for a cut of the night .
thats an old stomping ground a is not it ?
did you have a ticket on there ?
and now there are two fish that have gone over fifty pound they might be a repeat catch if i get lucky .
doe that count ?
it count for me .
it count for me .
it count for me .
it count for me .
you are going to be gutted though if the first fifty catch a recapture of something youve already caught three time .
surely thats a gutter .
i think the context of this room will be over them .
i do not think gutting is the word catching a fifty pound .
id prefer it to be a new fish .
there one fish in there that i did not catch and thats a zip linear at the minute .
it is probably forty three pounds. . thats the dream to catch that one .
well cross the break before we come to it .
well see what happens .
well see what happens .
coming in all pumped up .
ive had it .
yeah it doesnt count .
what about you rudy ?
talk about your trip mate .
ive been away got back on friday evening .
little trip over to europe .
got in a habit the last three or four year of doing a trip in the spring and a trip in the autumn .
went earlier on in the year with josh that work here josh dull .
had a good trip and this time around i went with oscar thornton one of our sponsored angler .
he can catch them .
he can catch them .
but ive not fished for infrages .
we were on the same syndicate for a few year .
i used to fish a bit together .
but yeah went over two different venue .
first one did not work out very .
we blanked for a couple of night .
that one forgot to grow a wrist of his tail .
the reservoir carp over there are unreal a proper box of chocolate .
every one of them is different .
but yeah that wa from the second venue .
we turned up at this big three hundred acre reservoir .
i did not know hardly anything about it to be honest .
not many people do that .
do they drive out to france and try and find somewhere to fish ?
the thing is a you do these long journey .
we went from the second venue to this one .
it is a four and a half hour drive and the whole time you are thinking probably will not get on .
it is quite annoying in itself .
you think we are probably going to have to have a plan c after this .
but we got there managed to get in a good area .
what we thought wa a good area .
we tried a little bit of intel on where you want to be the time of year but did not know anything about fishing .
and it is called fishing .
it wa fishing super long three hundred and fifty plus meter .
long cast .
yeah long cast .
i did not think i could still do it .
thats a couple of cast .
yeah it wa all boat work .
and the fishing wa incredible from the off .
much that we started getting worried about kit and battery when the action started .
you always take enough be prepared take enough lead hook bait and all the rest of it .
but when it go off preparing for that is obviously impossible .
we ended up putting rod out together .
wed go out in the boat .
all the spot were gps .
we had four different spot fishing four rod each .
and we would go out to each individual spot get above it .
id have my one .
wed lower the rod off .
then id take both of the rod hold them out to the side a cut of sword .
and then wed trundle back to the bank .
coys coal .
it is a nice carp .
some of them are grey .
some of them are peachy looking .
and it can be twenty five pound or sixty five pound .
how many did you catch it ?
we couldnt work it out .
it got crazy .
i think i wa saying to you this morning .
we ended up putting back nice looking thirty pounder .
having a quick look in the net and putting them back and sitting back after thinking this is mad fishing .
we shouldnt be doing this .
we should be getting these out in a nice photo with them all .
but it wa crazy .
i think we had about fifty five carp in four day .
which is a relentless action .
i did five pack of crankx hook .
thank god i took enough with me .
but yeah unbelievable fishing .
explain what you do for permit .
and how much doe it cost in that ?
yeah you have to get a cartetepêche license which is a bit our rod license here i guess .
which cover you for where you have to choose the region .
you can get a week or you can get a year .
it is not expensive for a year permit .
no i do not think it is .
i do not know how much it is for a year .
it is time i do it because i am only doing it in those small window .
i never think i am going to go back that year .
i think it is about two hundred something euro .
is it ?
because i am getting one for u for next year .
yeah i think i paid about forty six euro which will cover me for probably about five week or something .
i do not know. . a long a youve got that and these lake are public and not syndicate you can rock up chance your arm .
and you can get that online can you ?
you can get that online .
you go online cartetepêche and it will come up .
and then you can translate into english .
obviously do some research on where you think you might be going .
if you are going total opposite end of the spectrum you probably have to check make sure you get the license for the region .
i think thats the case anyway .
i am pretty sure it is .
driving others .
he wa a bit of a joke driving home .
because oscar already had his because he bought a year one from when he went earlier in the year .
he went that wa a waste of forty six euro wasnt it ?
but you have to have it .
yeah of course you do .
youve got to check with these place .
you are allowed to night fish .
a lot of these place have small dedicated night zone .
you go there .
you feel yeah i am in the prime swim get set up .
if you havent done your research you quickly find out that you can not do the night .
then you are fishing day only in an area where all the bike are coming at night .
and the french on dame do not take you too .
no you hear all the horror story .
ive had some horrible thing happen in the past .
it is not for the fainthearted .
youve got every wit about you .
i do not think id be that comfortable going on my own .
a lot of people do .
they are not trying their own .
that adventure with when you get to share it with someone else it mean a lot more i think .
i think even boat work on your own when you are not fluent in the boat a a a bit that is ... you need to be doing it with your mate .
yeah and when you are not doing it for age we are saying a you probably find a and you guy when you do the monster cup you start off do not you a little bit finding your foot a little bit .
but the time you go home you are a good a anybody and then you forget it all .
you go back and forth .
it is waiting for something .
yeah eight year still not that good in a boat .
even by the end of the trip it is still that .
i think whatever r you want i know dan doesnt boat fishing that much either .
i wa talking to him about it .
he doesnt it that much. ?
i absolutely love it .
it is the way id to fish but i must admit when we got two and a half day into that i wa thinking old boat would half be nice when you are towing out that long .
back and forth back and forth .
yeah weve had it a few time in hungary .
you are normally not allowed to use big boat there .
we certainly werent on the lake we were fishing .
and you are fishing out long way .
how far out were we fishing ?
one hundred and sixty or something ?
no one hundred and twenty i think .
one hundred and twenty .
and you can catch many more of a boat .
that is the only time a boat but i think it is when you are allowed to use them .
it is boring though is not it ?
it is but especially in the same situation you are having there it wa we are catching load of you are not catching little one but we are catching even smaller fish than the one you were catching .
if you are doing that in a proper boat and it take you a long time to go back out you do get no sleep .
it is easier with one of them .
it is the kit a you need .
obviously with two of you take two of you take two lot of kit .
obviously i think we took six leisure battery and the two boat and all the rest of it .
but if you did not have all that stuff you thought i am going to chuck a leisure battery on board on my boat and i am going to get you get caught out within a day and a half and you trip through it .
you have much stuff .
even when i go each time now there always a great big list on my phone when i come home .
definitely need more of them .
need another one of them .
you should ... we need a spare boat .
a spare boat one hundred you do .
yeah there no point going on them trip without a spare engine spare boat repair kit spare leisure battery .
damien who one of our sponsored angler in france that help u out massively on our trip he an amazing boat .
and he doe a lot of them long trip .
he work six month of the year a a chef in his restaurant and then ha the rest of the year off and fish all the time .
you can imagine how good he is in them scenario .
and he take because he doe them long trip hell take ... it is a fold out solar panel thats probably the size of this table .
and i think it is a day charge for one of his battery .
obviously if you have that on rotation you are in good stead all the time .
but yeah certainly some fishing i love doing .
i think the fact that you do not know everything nowadays i think itll probably segue into what we are going to talk about later but that european fishing the mystery is still one hundred there the whole time you are there because you do not know anything .
your next bite could be fifty five pound .
you do not know any of the carp .
ive had a few 70 using boat work .
how many of them are you at ?
about one .
there you go .
that did not work out did it ?
yeah not a good one .
how wa you catching them then ?
exactly the same a our fish here .
the only thing i stepped up wa my hook to an x. i normally use standard crank .
i wa using crank hex in a size four .
there you go .
thats how i wa catching them .
i am going to go with a hook .
i am going to go with a hook .
i am going to go with a hook .
i am going to go with a hook .
i am going to go with a hook .
i am going to go with a hook .
i am going to go with a hook .
i wa using crank hex in a size four .
there you go .
thats how i wa catching them .
the only thing i wa doing slightly different because everything we caught wa on double 20mm bottom baits. . there a lot of bust on chat and if anyone do not know they are the little tiny catfish and a few nuisance craze and stuff .
this time of year weve gone not normally too bad for those but because of that we were using big bait .
the only thing i did slightly different ive been using the i know you did ive used double hook bead quite a lot when i am using ronnys and woffters but i pulled the bead down to where the shrink tube end .
there wa some travel there .
in my mind it wa it is a huge bait .
i wanted to be able to get out of the way a soon a the caught swallowed it .
can you not use a longer bit of shrink tube there though ?
no because thats on a swivel is not it ?
doe that go over the shrink tube ?
you could but id be worried about the hook ring swivel being able to pas over that thing .
. . it is locking on .
nothing he doe .
nothing he doe in his mind .
see thats i would lose them that .
i genuinely ive fished a lot that before out on them big lake and ive lost them and you lost one out of thirty bite or whatever .
and i use a similar rig in i went to a place a commercial water called teleats a couple of year back a few year back and use that exact presentation there a . they had twenty seven bite landed all of them .
thats what i meant .
that exact presentation .
i swear they are person to person .
they can you could that .
dimo could give me one of these rig and id lose it on it .
and it then hed lad ten out of ten .
you play your carp generally a lot harder than most people ive seen though .
get them back out .
get them back out .
do you think ill plan that hard ?
it is they are white cape .
you couldnt learn the carp on a white cape .
thats when i first joined and i wa screwing because i kept losing fish on them and him and dan are landing everything they hook on them .
it is it is your preference .
i think what it doe do though catching all of them on them on them big double bottom bait .
thats something i never do here now .
year ago when i first started fishing it wa all snowman or two .
i know dimo doe load of that fishing and i think ive seen him doing that quite a lot and you feel i am going to try it and you do not .
and then you go there and get forced to because of nuisance fishing stuff .
get all them result .
you think how am i doing that ?
why are not i doing that ?
i always think that when we are ill never stop doing using high visual hook bait because it work .
but we know they come in sometimes and single that out .
i think most of the time it work out that you catch more it but sometimes it doe work against you .
yeah for sure .
but it is figuring out when that is in it thats the thing .
yeah it is whatever your confidence with is not it ?
i think the standard bottom bait you hardly ever see anybody using it and you never see somebody with two bottom bait on their hair .
it work when you are changing sometimes .
there buoyancy in everybodys hook bait .
fish get used to seeing it do not they ?
shall we get into this question ?
chuck it up .
i wa sent to spooner privately on facebook which i thought wa a good question and with how far technology ha come over the last ten year with rig mechanic and i think well explore this wider where could it be in the next ten year ?
i think it is a good question .
i think we can spin off technology in load of different way .
it doesnt have to necessarily be rig mechanic hook swivel lead .
i think it can be social medium god know what else the internet the fact the information out there .
briefly mentioned this to daemo this morning .
he wasnt that convinced it is come that far wa he daemo ?
i do not think it ha .
if i go back to when i wa nineteen twenty we were fishing the i am fifty three this week thats a long time thats thirty three year .
thats a good memory .
you are a cheeky bastard .
the biggest significant change in tackle at that point wa we were using eleven foot two pound twelve foot two pound two and a quarter long range fishing you stepped up to a two and a half .
you wouldnt go barbell fishing with them lot of now .
we were fishing little weedy lake where the cart were getting away because you did not have the power in the tackle to get them in .
we were fishing with cardinal 55s and that thing very small rod and reel compared to what wa available today .
the most significant advance i think in fishing rod at that point would have been about that wa ninety one ninety one ninety two ninety one ninety two dawa come out with the amorphous fishing rod .
that absolutely changed the game .
you could hook up we could hook up in the same lake and they couldnt get in the weed and we could pull them in with the weed and it wa absolute game changer .
we had s 3000s came out .
i wa fortunate that id been using dawa gear for a long time prior to that .
knew the guy who became the md dawa i got one of the very first set of amorphous and the s 3000s .
they were completely different .
when wa the s then ?
about ninety one .
they are still doing that real now .
you are talking about i think the amorphous wa the biggest change and then from that point onwards everybody else caught up .
fishing rod have improved because material have improved fishing line have improved but i am fishing at the moment with our three pounder which are probably not too dissimilar to the amorphous .
because if youve got a two and three quarter now youd probably float a fish with it .
then it wa the ultimate long range rod but i am using s 3000s .
i am using our three pounder on this little lake .
i am using some of my old tackle that i use .
ive got bank stick from twenty year ago with steve neville because i collect tackle and ive been using it for the last thousand year .
yeah it is nice .
it is the same gear that i wa using thirty year ago .
thing havent moved on that far .
youve got a much sharper hook on now though do you think ?
no because i used to sharpen more hook then .
i think to the mass though id agree .
you said if people are not sharpening their hook and i think the ease of rig mechanic now if we look at something youd say in the last ten year the spinner rig is something thats come about is not it in the last ten year ?
that is a tie a couple of time and you are an absolute expert at tying it .
you have not got to have any brain power .
it is easy .
you can change the hook .
and you are presented nine time out of ten .
thats the key is not it ?
but my rig going back to when i wa nineteen wa a helicopter rig which wa two bead pulled on a bit of tubing with a swivel in it .
all it did not drop the lead and it wa probably not the safest rig in the world but it wa never tangled and i had a sharp hook on because i sharpened it myself because hook were shit absolute shit .
and i had to sharpen it with the lead and door and mustard hook .
they were terrible .
in that perspective youve got hook that are readily available to everybody that are sharp .
but i think i could use the same gear now and catch what i am catching .
but i think we should do a match shouldnt we ?
i think there a big caveat there though damir .
you were doing that thirty year ago .
you were sharpening hook and you were fishing a heli setup that you knew wa presented .
how many people around you were doing the same thing and having the same result ?
i do not know if they were group they were but you end up being the product developer of the company .
thats the stress thats been .
thats the point though is not it ?
you said you had that little group of people doing it doing it and youd argue we could probably sit around this table and name all those people individually that stand out that we are doing it .
now everything is available to absolutely everybody .
everybody can be a a far a rig mechanic and stuff go everyone can be a damian clark everyone can be a terriern because it is all there ready made to chuck on cast out and then obviously the watercraft and the fig start coming into it then .
but a far a the actual rig side of thing go being available to absolutely everyone in the last ten year is something thats prevalent .
but bait hasnt moved on either .
yeah it is all the same .
it all come around in a circle .
i think the wider discussion is probably in ten year time .
and you are talking about thirty year ago .
thirty year ago .
yeah not even ten year ago .
ten year ago we were using the spinner .
do you think ?
no not far off .
no i reckon it wa eight year ago .
it is before we moved in here .
yeah but it is definitely not a wide a it is .
it must be the last five year that it is gone berserk and it last five six year .
yeah we had probably tied one and all the rest of it is definitely last five six year .
but i think when we brought out the spinner swivel which wa thomas idea and dan put it on whatever dvd it wa .
no no i did a monster cast of it .
because we were air shipping in boem werent we ?
i think we sold eighteen month worth in about three week .
everyone wanted to use that rig .
do you get a bonus out of that ?
yeah probably .
you said that is if you walk around a day ticket now or a syndicate you could maybe not everyone but a large percentage of people will have spinner rig out .
do i think one of my biggest thing if you label technology wider than the actual ntac on the product itself i would say the information available to people now is probably one of the biggest thing in the last ten year .
because ten year ago instagram facebook and it were quite infancy werent they ?
not everybody wa on them .
maybe facebook they were .
facebooks probably twenty year old now .
but cartfishing going on it how big is it now ?
it is enormous now is not it on social medium .
and the information now to any lake pretty much if you are a member of somewhere or you go to a group of lake or something you can find out everything thats going on there .
i opened up your mobile phone .
year ago when ... mate year ago it wa get the angling time .
giving an example i remember getting ... my dad used to buy me the angling time every week .
it is thats the only bit of information or anything to read if you every week .
and there wa a picture of this lad on the back and i recognized him .
and it wa a twenty eight very cool .
and i thought i know where that is .
i wa fourteen .
i want to join there .
i am going to go down there .
and i joined it .
i caught that fish before the next angling time .
of course you did .
yeah of course you did .
we expected that .
but that wa all there wa .
it wa in word of mouth everything wa ... what fish wa it though mate ?
pigeon at the garrison .
yeah i do miss that .
magazine i remember you used to go fishing place and that and you would think ... youd know a certain fish wa in there .
if i go back x amount of year it might be a twenty five mirror or something .
and you think i am going to catch it this weekend .
and then you are going to pick up carp talk or something that .
it is big fish now !
but now youd know in the same day wouldnt you ?
pretty much go up or someone would come in the office and say to fully scale one come out of such and such you go you are joking .
i wa going to go that weekend and you hope you find there it is .
that is ... thats real double edged innit ?
it sped everything up .
yeah i think it is amazing that people can get that information .
if they want to they might find out for example a lake fishing and itll make them go .
theyve got stuff at this go at the weekend it is fishing .
and at the same time that youve lost that not knowing and rocking up and finding out whats going to happen for yourself you everythings done for you a little bit is not it ?
i still do not think you truly know them until you get there do you ?
you get there and fish it .
yeah thats what i wa going to say .
you still feel excited when you drive through the gate and you still cast out not knowing whether you are going to get one or not .
yeah not .
thats why we all do it innit ?
yeah i it is whether or not that that social medium thing you device a lot of opinion doesnt it ?
i do not think sometimes you need you can know too much .
and then it id rather live in a bit of ignorance go to the lake and if the biggings been out when i am there or come out the night before doesnt matter doe it ?
the difference because i wa a member of a syndicate a few year ago with a load of biggings in it and there wa guy on there older guy and theyve been on there forever .
they do not do social medium they havent got a modern phone or anything that .
and theyll say i had three yesterday at a forty seven mirror or wherever they are not that bothered it is been matshotted .
and then theyll show you and ill go it is the peach and theyll go is it ?
ill go it is the peach ?
it is what i want .
ill go ive had him load of time .
it is that that art of going for or the thing of going fishing and enjoying it .
not bothered about getting stuff up on social medium .
obviously unfortunately fortunately or unfortunately for u in this room it is our industry .
we rely on people getting that information and feeding off it and doing something about it and going fishing buying kit and catching carp .
we can not have a problem with it .
i havent got a problem with it .
ill tell people what i am catching on that the lake i am fishing and then it get busy because of it .
but that is part of it .
if people are going to go and enjoy themselves because ive posted something great .
but then on the flip side of that and you can tell that they are nonpublicity .
you can go down there and catch lot and go back down there the next week and get back in the same stream .
that is nice .
that is the difference .
not going to laugh .
but also thats also etiquette .
the etiquette ha changed massively .
there is no etiquette on a lot of these lake .
no you have to live with it a little bit .
tie it down raise it a little bit .
you fish one swim for a little bit catch quite a few out of it and then you can not get back in that swim any more .
that happens all the time .
it is part of it .
mate do not tell me about that .
you never wrap spot .
funny enough we had that last week .
when you were having such a great time we were last week i thought it is going to be great .
i should do a story tomorrow .
but i sat down and even i thought if i do that thats going to show everyone a mirror .
everyone you are carving up and having a good time .
and the people that do know that do not can guess from where you theyll be down here .
theyll come down and it is going to ruin it for me .
i am i shut them up when i get home .
ill keep that a little bit quiet .
and you are french trip .
but then i am going to come down and ... not english people but youll get a lot of european following you and stuff and theyll see ... you can not have that many .
no there can not be that many .
no there no point in putting anything out live while you are there .
not because they are going to come down and ruin our fishing but because you are worried about thing what happened to darrell when they come down and burn your vehicle out .
you are not welcome .
and you never know if you are that welcome at place do you ?
we are quieter now when we go away .
keep a bit of a lower profile .
shout about it after .
i do not know mate .
it is part and parcel .
fishing busier now because more people are doing it .
i think it is good that more people fish because i think fishing good for people .
you have to live with it i think .
let go around and have a little think about where we think it could be in ten year time .
because obviously weve talked about there not being load of huge advance in the last ten year other than isolated product that are helping thing become easier to the mass .
but where do you think it could be in ten year ?
maybe if it is an advance in technology and tackle or social medium where could it get to do you think ?
yeah i do not know .
i think we are a little bit in this spot in general in life a not in fishing but technology is increasing at such a rate that you either move with the technology and everyone accepts it or there more rule .
with the whole ai thing is a government going to put more rule in to stop ai from happening a much a it could do if you let it run ?
and it is the same with fishing .
are lake going to ban using drone ?
yeah lot of them already have .
yeah there technology of using boat boat and that make fishing infinitely easier .
but doe it come into our fishing that much ?
if fishery owner and club or whatever want to keep the essence of fishing there then they will put rule in place to stop people ruining it .
and thats what tends to happen .
i do not think fishing will change that much .
i think well probably get more and more information .
itll become easier and easier to the mass a it ha done over the last ten year .
but in general you will not feel any different going fishing and neither will i in ten year time .
i do not think .
how do you feel about the technology that is out there now ?
are you people that embrace it and think if you want to use it use it ?
or have you got a problem with it ?
dang id probably be the best person to ask .
i havent got a problem with it a long a you do not come anywhere near me .
if you want to start flying drone over in the swim or putting a boat boat through the swim then i am going to have a problem with that .
but i am not going to put myself in the position where i am fishing lake where thats happening .
there nothing i wouldnt say to ali face .
but he wa fishing a little lake and he had a drone up and wa driving a boat boat to the spot using the drone to see where it wa .
i am not interested in doing that .
you all go fishing for your own reason .
the thing i about fishing is working it out and using my own skill if you to put the lead in the boat exactly where i want it to go .
if you become completely reliant on gadget and technology if something go wrong with that we were talking about your boat engine going wrong you can not do it because you are reliant on it .
ive seen people fishing a little lake that the garrison we were and he putting his bait out with a bait boat not much further than between me and you under a bush .
and you think what are you doing there for ?
you could put it there .
i love getting in the lake and putting my rod out or whatever that is .
but there got to be an element of skill and the chase of whatever you are going for .
if youve made that particular cast and it is difficult and it is taking you three cast and you think gosh it is on the spot .
technology is great for certain thing but it is not for me .
i do not need to know if there bait left in the swim and putting a camera on the bottom of the lake because i see people we know disappearing up their own arses because they know too much .
it is blowing their head up .
and sometimes i am quite happy living in ignorance .
yes good point .
i do not have you wrong with that .
i do think thats a good point you are saying about the camera and stuff .
i spoke to stokesy when i wa going out to carp arena and he wa fishing some snag in the swim .
i knew i wa going to fish .
he said if youve got one of those camera you can lower down .
he go because when i wa fishing there i thought i wa fishing perfectly .
i wa lowering the rig down getting a good drop .
but when i put the camera down there wa load of stick .
my boom wa sticking up and all the way .
he said if you do not get one your chance are you will not be fishing .
and i did not get one because i did not want to go down that route .
i am not saying they are not good because i think the camera could be a big edge for thing commercial water .
when you are turning up for a week and you are following someone in a peg .
and you want to check the spot where you are working .
yeah you can go out there and lower a camera down on the twenty wrap at the big tree that everyone fish .
and there forty kilo there .
itll stop you putting twenty kilo out which i think could make a difference to your week .
i do not think they are a bad thing but for me you said i think you could end up ... because if you go to the one water we can not use it .
and all of a sudden then you feel ive got the same drop i wa getting before but i wa sitting terribly .
i am probably sitting terribly .
i think you can know too much .
you are talking about camera .
i saw on i think it wa instagram the other day there a start up where theyve got ... the line is a camera cable .
youve got a camera on the end of your fishing line which is must be some i do not know ... i saw this .
it is an electrical fishing line is not it ?
yeah electrical fishing line .
they are lure fishing and you can see on your rod whats coming to get it .
it is they are crowdfunding trying to start getting a start up for it .
i guess thats where this question come from .
how far in ten year time will that become the norm ?
we are going to see much more of that .
that wa unbelievable .
what a time i had .
i am going to do that again next week .
it is a lot more exciting .
we are ingrained in it .
that to u is the same feeling either way .
it go back to what daymo said each their own is not it ?
it is if you are happy with doing it thats fine .
it is not a hobby is not it ?
it is you do not ruin my day it is fine .
it is you do not have you on .
daymo you wouldnt have all those modern day thing if you were in charge of a syndicate theyd be no way .
i think it is you and the fish .
what about going to huge venue in europe ?
ill get that .
we had this conversation when dan wa in here did not we ?
using the drone to find the fish .
if youve got a week to do it if thats what you want to do then time yes .
if you are making a film and it is costing a load of money i can see why we would do it .
unless you are bait boating out at twenty five even up to thirty mil hookbaits at some point you are not even fishing for the fish that you are trying to catch .
they become a for me a necessary evil .
i am not going to cut my nose off despite my face .
i am not going to sit there catching small fish after small fish because i do not want to use a bait boat .
you feel you have to .
and i guess going back to the camera side of thing i said it is you when we were doing the underwater test tape .
after dan had caught the big crane it wa me and you and it wa my turn to have a rod on the spot .
now if i wa fishing and ive gone fishing ive got a single rod up against a snag i would be sitting there the whole time thinking any minute thats going to go the carp going to come in going to get one bite .
when you can watch it happen and a exciting it is when it is on when it is not and there nothing in that swim .
you want to cry .
yeah it wa horrible .
you sit there and start that .
and then a you said you can know too much .
i think the drone now is especially for talking to the european guy that i talk to that is a important a their fishing rod .
having a drone in the kit is a important a anything .
one of the guy who work here is fishing a big lake ?
and he a traditionalist if you .
he not going to use a drone .
he walk around the lake he doe his homework he bait up .
and on that lake everybodys got a drone .
theyve all got bait boat that have got gps system on them .
hell get an area going .
theyll people will find out where he catching from .
and then youve got bait coming across three hundred yard and they are coming into a swim .
that go back to the etiquette thing doesnt it ?
sorry all of these thing are if people have got etiquette and they are used ?
but if they are not then it ruin the whole thing .
yeah it leaf a sour taste then doesnt it ?
it doe when he sat there at night he sat up and you can see the little light coming across the lake .
they are coming out and they are ... in his swim .
ill tell you something they are using staying on the drone subject a minute .
something they are using a lot in sport fishing and that now .
they are using them to take the bait out .
fishing from the shore .
that is going to creep into carp fishing .
ive got no doubt about it .
that will creep into carp fishing .
fishing you said inaccessible place .
i think thing ... ive always thought something a zig is made for something that .
you can put it out fish it out long .
not having to worry about tangling .
maybe have a little pva loop on it .
you can lower it down and it fall down .
there are many example of where that could help .
and i do think people more and more people are doing it .
ive seen little reel and thing on instagram .
people are using it in carp fishing .
but i think for baiting up and stuff that is coming .
that will be a thing .
someone in our industry will bring out drone for carp fishing .
ive got no doubt about that .
u . i am going to get off on the screen now .
this is coming out in a couple of week .
i think tom though .
those thing will get banned by lot and lot of water .
can you imagine that on linear ?
yeah i know .
they will not allow it .
i think with technology if it make something thats impossible possible it is with me .
but when it make something thats already possible easy thats when i do not it .
anything of true value is difficult or rare .
and if you make it too easy then it is neither of them .
and then it ha no value to anyone .
and then that ruin the whole thing .
catching a fifty pounder .
youll probably catch one next week droning out .
it still count .
youve got all that technology available now .
weve got bait boat to take out and touch with a button .
weve got the best possible bait .
the sharpest hook .
yet you still can not catch a fifty pounder .
there is no excuse now is there ?
everything is available there .
it is available but the person using it ha still got to know what they are doing .
havent they ?
have they ?
that worry me quite a bit in our industry sometimes .
when stuff get brought out thats easy to use and the fact you can chuck it on and cast it out not having any foundation of looking after a carp playing it in knowing anything .
you can go out and spend five grand on kit and go out there and pretty much do it quite on some lake .
i do not know man .
i do not think you can .
i think the analogy which i use with spooner quite a lot even a blind squirrel find them sometimes .
do what ?
no but ill stay on that because you can .
because if you go to a known lake in the uk thats a day ticket place if you get in certain swim youve got to fish in the middle and thats where all the fish live and it is not particularly weedy .
youve got a bait boat and youve got to set the gps on it put the bait in and the readytied rig and all that .
yeah we have a bait boat in the uk and yeah .
whats this here ?
this is going to be a drone man is not it ?
we are going to catch you using a shark .
shark using stingray head .
whats a pretty big bit of kit in it ?
for anyone listening and not watching the lad have put a video on the screen .
that hasnt got any sound .
yeah thats going to show a guy putting out a huge piece of old fish boat .
that is a massive drone a . i think ive seen these on instagram .
and the thing is theyve designed them with quick release stuff on the controller and stuff .
yeah how is that not fun ?
thats what it mean .
this is the thing this is why people get into this type of fishing .
look at that churning out a barge .
there no finesse in that fishing is there ?
no big lump of fish .
you can not compare the result can you ?
it is the same a a bait boat .
you can not compare the result from a bait boat and a nonbait boat .
if you catch ten on a bait boat and you are caught free normal .
i am not going to start naming any name but there are some quite influential people in our industry that have caught some famous carp using a bait boat and all the carp out of that lake on a bait boat .
we do not need to say who it is but i am saying there is people that have gone on syndicate emptied them .
the only thing is they are holding up for the camera but theyve caught a lot of them fish .
it is look at something burfield for example .
there pretty much nobody on there .
i think i think theyve banned them recently .
but before that i listened to a podcast when i wa driving out to france .
it wa elliot on fishing burfield .
and he wa saying that his bait boat broke and it stopped him going for about four week because he wa waiting for it to come back .
he couldnt go without it because he couldnt fish the spot he wanted to fish by casting because they are too far and they are obviously weird angle or whatever out past weed .
it stopped him going fishing .
we had another one of our angler wa fishing a lake that we fished and we were moaning at him because he wa using his boat all the time and exactly the same thing happened .
he wa trying to borrow one of our old one because he did not want to go there without it .
thats the thing when you start relying on technology though is not it ?
it will stop you going .
for example would you still go if you were on a syndicate and you did a lot of fishing on the winter or whatever and maggot were the way forward on their bit of body crumb of maggot and maggot were a shortage ?
would you still go for three night without them knowing that chance are you aint going to catch nothing ?
probably not .
no it is not me .
sometimes these thing do stop you going when you need to still go .
everyone care much about their time doesnt they ?
and you want to make the most of your time .
and i think thats what people the routine people get into .
it is they go over there they are enjoying their time in the short space of time because it is making it easy for them .
and then when you havent got it it is i am going to sit there for four day for a ten for the result .
but ive not started in the beginning i think using it .
i think it is a good topic and i think well probably end up revisiting this at some point a thing come out and thing evolve when the flying drone come out with the spot on the end we can start talking about it again .
it is good though it is a good conversation .
you can talk about it all day .
i think well wrap it up there .
i enjoyed that .
that went quick .
yeah it did go quick .
i think well get some more question in for the next one .
hopefully for you if you are getting out fishing i know you are going out demoing next week .
you are going to wait are you going out tom ?
yeah i am out this week a . i blanked last week .
i do not that .
well say the guy that sent in that question that weve been talking about i think it wa leon frail something that sent it to you .
well get his detail spoon and well send him a little merch bundle a we said we would .
any of the question that we use and do not forget we are going to be going through them all the time .
even if you sent one in the second podcast before last we could still end up plucking your question out .
keep the question coming because they are great .
the following is a conversation with roger panros physicist mathematician and philosopher at university of oxford .
he ha made fundamental contribution in many discipline from the mathematical physic of general relativity and cosmology to the limitation of computational view of consciousness .
in his book the emperor new mind roger writes that quote child are not afraid to pose basic question that may embarrass u a adult to ask .
in many way my goal with this podcast is to embrace the inner child that is not constrained by how one should behave speak and think in the adult world .
roger is one of the most important mind of our time it wa truly a pleasure and an honor to talk with them .
this conversation wa recorded before the outbreak of the pandemic .
for everyone feeling the medical psychological and financial burden of the crisis i am sending love your way .
stay strong we are in this together well be this thing .

and now here my conversation with roger penrose .
you mentioned in conversation with eric weissstein on the portal podcast that two thousand and one space odyssey is your favorite movie .
which aspect if you could mention of it representation of artificial intelligence science engineering connected with you ?
there were also some scene there which is amazing .
and how they science wa done .
people say you interstellar this amazing movie which is the most scientific movie .
i thought it is not a patch on two thousand and one .
they went into also to detail .
and they are getting the free fall done .
and if anything i thought it wa streaming done .
the detail were my mind rising .
i do not know if there thing the scene where at the beginning they have these human ancestor which is eight eight becoming monolith .
and it is the one where he throw the bone up into the air .
and then it becomes this there le than amazing sequence there .
what do you make of the monolith ?
doe it have any scientific or philosophical meaning to you ?
doe think of the most box innovation ?
that come from artistic clark .
i wa always a great fan about the clark .
it is a nice plot device .
yeah another plot is excellent .
how ninezero decides to get rid of the astronaut because he it she belief that they will interfere with the mission .
it is this view .
i do not know whether i disagree with it question to certain sense .
see the the machine seemed to think it wa a superior to the human .
and it wa entitled to get rid of the human being and run the show itself .
what do you think how did the thing ?
do you think how is flawed evil or if we think about system how would we want how to do the same thing in the future ?
what wa the flaw there ?
it is one supposed to believe that how wa conscious .
it wa played rather that way a though how wa a conscious being because how wa showed some pain some cognitive the hell appeared to be cognizant of what it mean to die .
and therefore had that .
thats yes .
and the inkling of conscious .
i am not sure that aspect of it wa made completely clear whether how wa adjusted very sophisticated computer which did not have these feeling and somehow .
if you are it did not make the idea being turned off .
how doe it change thing if how wa it wasnt conscious ?
it might say that it would be wrong to turn it off if it wa conscious .
these question arise if you think ai wanted the idea .
it is a mixture in a sense .
you say if it is trying to do everything a human can do and if you take the view that consciousness is something which would come along when the computer is sufficiently complicated sufficiently whatever criterion and you use to characterize it consciousness in term of some computational criterion .
how doe consciousness change our evaluation of the decision that hell made ?
i guess ive started to say that people have been confused about this .
because if they say these machine will overcome conscious but simply because it is a degree of computation .
and when you get beyond that it is a certain degree of computation .
it will overcome conscious .
then of course you have all these problem .
you might say one of the reason you are doing ai is because you are going to send a device out to some distant planet .
and you do not want to send a human out there because then you have to bring it back again .
and thats cost you far more than sending it there and leaving it there .
but if this device is a conscious entity then you have to face up to the fact that thats immoral .
and the mere fact that you are making some ai device and getting a thinking that remove your responsibility to it would be incorrect .
and this is a flaw in that viewpoint .
i am not sure how people who take it very .
i am going to have this curious conversation with i am going to forget name and i am afraid because this is what happens to me at the moment .
how stuttered .
and hed written this book god i that .
i thought it wa a fantastic book .
but i did not agree with his conclusion from god or stephen .
i think hed gone it wrong. ?
i tell you my story because id never met him .
and then i knew i wa going to meet him .
the occasion i excuse coming in you want to talk to me and thats fine .
and i thought in my mind i am going to paint him into a corner ?
his argument to convince him that certain number are conscious .
some integer large enough integer are conscious .
and this wa going to be my reductive i had a certain .
i started having this argument with him .
he simply leapt into the corner .
he did not even need to be painted into it .
he took the view of it said number were conscious .
i thought that wa the reductive id have said them .
but he seemed to think it wa perfectly reasonable point to do .
without the absurdum there yes interesting .
but the thing you mentioned about how is the intuition that a lot of the people at least in the artificial intelligence world had and have i think they do not make it explicit but that if you increase the power of computation naturally consciousness will emerge .
yeah i think thats what they think .
thats because they can not think of anything else .
and it is a reasonable thing .
you think what the brain do doe do a lot of computation .
i think most of what you call computation is done by the cerebellum .
this is one of the thing that people do not much mention .
i am going to come to this subject from the outside and certain thing strike me which you hardly ever hear mentioned .
you heard mentioned about the left business thing .
you move your arm thats your left side of the brain .
and i am all that stuff .
and it is more than that if you have this plot of different part of the brain there are two of these thing called the homoncular which these picture of a distorted human figure and showing different part of the brain controlling different part of the body .
and it is not simply thing the hand is controlled and sense both sensory and motor on the left side left hand on the side .
it is more than that .
vision is at the back .
your foot at the top .
and since it is about the worst organization you are going to make them. . it can not be a mistake in nature .
there something going on there .
and this is made more pronounced when you think of the cerebellum .
and cerebellum ha when i wa first thinking about these thing i this told it had half a many neuron or something that .
and now they tell me it is got far more neuron than the cere the cerebrum .
the cerebrum is this convoluted thing at the top .
people will be talking about .
cerebellum is this thing .
shes a bit a ball of wool. . it is the back underneath .
it is got more connection .
computationally it is got much more going on .
and this from this cerebrum .
but a far a we know it is slightly controversial .
cerebellum is entirely unconscious .
the action you have are it is a pianist who can play a an incredible piece of music and think of any move this little finger into this little key to get a hit it the moment .
doe he or she consciously will that movement ?
the consciousness is coming in .
it is probably to do with a feeling of the piece of music .
this is being performed in that thing which is going on .
but the detail and whats going on are controlled .
i would think almost entirely by the cerebellum .
thats where you have this precision and the detailed .
once you get you think of a tennis player or something .
doe that tennis player think exactly how the which muscle should be moved in what direction is enough ?
of course not .
but he or she will maybe think if the ball is angle in such a way and that corner that will be tricky for the opponent .
and the detail of that are all done largely with the cerebellum .
thats where well have precise motion .
but it is unconscious .
why is it interesting to you that much computation is done in the cerebellum and yet is unconscious ?
because it is the view that somehow it is computation which is producing the consciousness .
and it is here you have an incredible amount of computation going on .
and a far a we know it is completely unconscious .
why whats the difference ?
and i think it is an important thing .
whats the difference ?
why is the cerebellum ?
but all this very peculiar stuff that very hard to see on a computational perspective having the everything have to cross over under the other size and do something which look completely inefficient .
and youve got funny thing the frontal lobe and the what a pretire what do we call the lobe ?
and the place where they come together you have the different part the control .
one to do with motor and the other to do with sensory .
and there opposite each other rather than being connected by a new but it is not though youve got the electrical circuit .
there something else going on there .
it is the idea that it is a complicated computer seems to me to be completely missing the point .
there must be a lot of computation going on .
but the cerebellum seems to be much better at doing that than the cerebellum is .
for sure i think what explains it is it is half hope and half we do not know whats going on and therefore from the computer science perspective you hope that a touring machine can be perfectly and achieve general intelligence .
you have this wonderful thing about during and gertal and church and cary and various people particularly touring .
and i guess post wa the other one .
these people who developed the idea of what a computation is .
and there were different idea of what a computer developed differently .
i have a church a ive done it .
it wa very different from touring .
but then they were shown to be equivalent .
and the view emerged that what we mean by a computation is a very clear concept .
and one of the wonderful thing that touring did wa to show that you could have what we call the universal touring machine .
you have to have a certain finite device .
it ha to have an unlimited storage space which is accessible to it .
but the actual computation if you is performed by this one universal device .
and the view come away .
you have this universal touring machine .
and maybe the brain is something that .
the universal touring machine and it is got maybe not an unlimited storage but a huge storage accessible through it .
and this model is one which is whats used in ordinary computation .
thats a very powerful model .
and the universalness of computation is very useful .
you can have some problem and you may not see immediately how to put it onto a computer .
if it is something of that nature then how there were subprogram and subretains were normally i learned a little bit of computing when i wa a student but not very much .
but it wa enough to get the general idea .
and there something pleasant about a formal system that .
where you can start discussing about whats approval whats not these kind of thing .
and youve got a notion which is an absolute notion this notion of computability .
and the unitability .
it rest when thing mathematical problem are computably solvable and much are not .
it is a very beautiful area of mathematics .
and it is a very powerful area of mathematics .
and it underlies the whole i will not say about the principle of computing machine that we have today .
could you say what is gator and compliteness theorem and how doe it maybe also say is it heartbreaking to you ?
and how doe it interfere with this notion of computation ?
and it is not consciousness .
the idea is idea which i formulated and my first year a a graduate student in cambridge .
i did my undergraduate work in mathematics in london .
and i had a colleague in person we used to discus thing computational and logical system quite a lot .
id heard about gator theorem id have been worried by the idea that it seemed to say there were thing in mathematics that you could never prove .
and when i went to cambridge a a graduate student i went to various course .
i wa doing pure mathematics .
i wa sort a little bit different from my superversion people .
but it wa an algebraic geometry .
and i wa interested i got particularly interested in three lecture course that were nothing to do with what i wa supposed to be doing .
one wa a course by hermann bundy on einstein general theory of relativity which wa a beautiful course .
he wa an amazing lecturer .
brought these thing alive absolutely .
and now there wa a course on quantum mechanic given by the great physicist paul dirac very beautiful course in a completely different way .
it wa very organized and never got excited about anything seemingly .
but it wa extremely put together and i found that amazing too .
third course it wa nothing to do with what i should be doing wa a course on mathematical logic .
and i got a i say my discussion with the impertible .
wa the incomplete and sterome already deeply within mathematical logic space ?
were you introduced in detail by the course by stine ?
and it wa two thing he described which were very fundamental to my understanding .
one wa two machine and the whole idea of computability and all that .
that wa all very much part of the course .
the other one wa the girl of the era .
and it wasnt what i wa afraid it wa to tell you there were thing in mathematics you couldnt prove .
it wa and he phrased it in a way which often people did not .
and if you read douglas hofstadis book he doesnt .
but stine made it very clear .
and also in a public lecture that he gave to a mathematical i think maybe the adam society one of the the mathematical undergraduate society .
and he made this point again very clearly that if youve got a formal system of proof .
suppose what you mean by proof is something which you could check with a computer .
to say whether youve got it or not youve got a lot of step .
have you carried this computational procedure ?
following the proof step of the proof correctly that can be checked by an algorithm by a computer .
thats the key thing .
now what you have to now is this any good ?
if youve got an algorithmic system which claim to say yes this is this youve proved it correctly this is true .
if youve proved it if you made it mistake it doesnt say it is true or false but if you have if youve done it then the conclusion youve come to is correct .
now you say why do you believe it is correct ?
because you looked at the rule and you said that one all .
yeah that one all .
what about that ?
i see what it is all . . you go through all the rule .
you say yes following those rule if it say yes it is true it is true .
youve got to make sure that these rule are one that you trust .
is if you follow the rule and it say it is a proof is the result true ?
and that your belief that it is true depends upon looking at the rule and understanding them .
now what girl or show that if you have such a system then you can construct a statement of the very kind that it is supposed to look at a mathematical statement .
and you can see by the way it is constructed and what it mean that it is true but not proveable by the rule that youve been given .
and it depends on your trust in the rule .
do you believe that the rule only give you truth ?
if you believe the rule only give you truth then you believe this other statement is also true .
i found this absolutely mindblowing .
when i saw this it blew my mind .
but my god you can see that this statement is true .
it is a good a any proof because it only depends on your belief in the reliability of the proof procedure .
thats all it is .
and understanding that the coding is done correctly and it enables you to transcend that system .
whatever system you have a long a you can understand what it is doing and why you believe it only give you truth then you can see beyond that system .
how do beyond it ?
what is it ?
it enables you to transcend that system .
it is your understanding of what the system is saying and what the statement that youve constructed is staying .
it is this quality of understanding whatever it is which is not governed by rule .
it is not a computational procedure .
this idea of understanding is now going to be within the rule of the within the formal system .
yes that come from a rule .
that come from a rule .
anyway because you have understood them to be rule which only give you truth .
there be no pointing it otherwise .
i am going to people say this say once that the rule is good a any other way it is not true .
you say you have to understand what the rule mean .
and why doe that understanding of the mean ?
give you something beyond the rule themselves .
and thats what it wa .
thats what blew my mind .
it somehow thats adding why the rule give you truth enables you to transcend the rule .
thats where even at that time thats already where the thought entered your mind that the idea of understanding or we can start calling it thing intelligence or even consciousness is outside the rule .
yes since ive always concentrated on understanding people say people sometimes point out thing we know what our creativity thats something a machine can not do is create .
what is creativity ?
and i do not know .
somebody can put some funny thing on a piece of paper and say thats creative .
and you could make a machine do that .
you say i am worried about that one .
i agree with it in a sense but it is hard to do anything with that statement .
you can make go see that understanding whatever it is .
and it is very hard to put your finger on it .
thats absolutely true .
can you try to define or maybe dance around a definition of understanding ?
to some degree but i do not i often wonder about this but there is something there which is very slippery .
it is something standing back .
and it is got to be something it is also got to be something which wa a value to our remote ancestor .
because sometimes there a cartoon which i drew sometimes showing you how all these there a in the foreground .
this mathematician doing some mathematical theorem .
there a little bit different joke in that into that .
he tried to prove some theorem .
and he about to be eaten by a saboteuse tiger who hiding in the underground .
and in the distance his cousin building growing crop building shelter domesticating animal .
and in this type of foreground they build a mammoth trap and this coral mammoth is falling into a pit .
and all these people around them are about to grab him .
and those are the one who the quality of understanding which go with all it is not the mathematician doing his mathematics .
this understanding quality is something else which is being a tremendous advantage to u not to u . see i do not think consciousness is limited to human .
thats the interesting question at which point if it is indeed connected to the evolutionary process at which point did we pick up this very hard question ?
it is certainly i do not think it is primate these picture of african hunting dog and how they can plan amongst themselves how to catch the antelope .
some of these david attenborough film i think it is probably wa one of them .
and you can see the hunting dog and they divide themselves into two group and they go into root two different root .
one of them go and they hide next to the river .
and the other group go around and they start yelping at these then embark i guess what if a noise hunting dog do ?
the antelope and they round them up and they chase them in the direction of the river .
and they are the other one waiting for them to get because when they get to the river it slows them down .
and they plant on them .
theyve obviously planned this all out .
somehow i have no idea how .
and there is some element of conscious planning a far a i can see i do not think it is some much of ai these day is done i wonder what they call bottomup system .
and that doesnt feel understanding .
and there no understanding and that whatsoever .
while you are being a little bit human centric i am going to talk about yeah not with the dog ever .
i say not human centric but i am in spoke by a lot by a logic centric .
is it possible that consciousness would look slightly different ?
i am not saying it is biological because we do not know .
i think other example of the elephant is a wonderful example too .
where they this wa i think this wa an item for one .
where the elephant ha to go from the long the trooper and have to go long distance .
and the leader of a trooper is a female .
they all are apparently .
and this female that she had to go all the way from one part of the country to another .
and a a certain point she made a detour and they went off in this big detour .
all the trooper came with her and this wa where her sister had died .
and there were her bone lying around and they go and pick up the bone and they hand it around and they caress the bone .
and then they put them back and they will go back again .
what do we have now they are doing ?
thats a lot of interesting .
there something going on .
there no clear connection with natural selection .
there some deep feeling going on there .
we have to do with their conscious experience .
and i think it is something that you overall have advantage .
i am not a trocese election but not directly to do with natural selection .
i that there something going on going on there .
i told you i am russian i tend to romanticise all thing of this nature that that is not merely cold hard computation .
perhaps i could lightly answer your question .
you were asking me what is it ?
there something about standing back and thinking about your and thought process .
and there is something that in the gut or thing because it is you are not following the rule .
you are standing back and thinking about the rule .
and there is something that you might say you think about you are doing something .
anything what the hell am i doing ?
and you stand back and think about what it is thats making you think such a way .
take a step back outside this the game youve been playing .
yeah you are back up and you think about you are not playing the game anymore .
you are thinking about what the hell you are doing in playing this game .
and thats somehow it is not a very precise discovery but somehow feel very true that thats somehow understanding this reflection .
the reflection yes .
there is a bit hard to put your finger on but there is something there which i think maybe could be unearthed at some point and see this is whats going on .
why conscious being have this advantage ?
what it is that give them advantage .
and i think it go way back .
i do not think we are talking about the hunting dog and the elephant .
thats pretty clear that octopus is the same quality .
and we call it consciousness .
yeah i think .
it is seen enough example of the way that they behave and the evolution route is completely different .
thats a good way back to some common ancestor or did it come separately .
my hope is that something simple but the hard question if there a hardware prerequisite we have to develop some hardware mechanism in our computer .
a you suggest well get to in a second we have to throw away the computer we know today .
the deterministic machine we know today that try to create it .
my hope of course is not but when i see i should go back to the story which in a sense i havent finished because i went to these three course .
when i wa a graduate student .
and i started to think i am i am a pretty what you might call a materialist in the sense of thinking that there no mystical or something around it which come in from boonos where you still that you still throw your life in a mental form .
i do not the word materialist because it is we know what material is .
and thats that is a bad word because there no mystical .
it is not something which is not not treatable by science .
it is beautifully put a pause in there for a second .
your materialist but you acknowledge that we do not know what the materialist .
i to call myself a scientist thats the most but it mean that yes the question go on here .
i began thinking if consciousness or understanding is something which is not a computational process what can it be ?
and i knew enough from my undergraduate work i knew about newtonian mechanic and i knew how you could put it on a computer .
there is a fundamental issue which is it is important or not that computation depends upon discrete thing .
you are using discrete element whereas the physical law is dependent on the continuum .
is this something to do with it ?
is it the fact that we are used to continuum in our physic ?
and if we model our physical system or used to discrete system ordinary computer i came to the view that thats probably not it .
i might have to retract on that someday but the view wa you can get close enough .
it is not all together clear i have to say but you can get close enough .
and it is a very impressive piece of computational work how you can work out the shape of those signal .
and now we have seeing these signal .
and they say yeah there a black hole spiral into each other .
this is a vindication of the power of computation in describing and sound general activity .
in that case we can get close .
but we the the the wood computation we can get close to understanding the physic .
you can get very close .
now is that close enough ?
and then i went to this course by dirak .
now i think it wa the very first lecture that he gave and he wa talking about the superposition principle .
and he said if you have a particle you usually think of particle can be over here or over there but in quantum mechanic it can be over here and over there at the same time .
and you have these state which involve a superposition in some sense of it different location for that particle .
and then you go out at his piece of chalk .
some people say brok it in two is a illustration of how the piece of chalk might be over here and over there at the same time .
and he wa talking about this and i my mind wandered .
i do not remember what he said .
i can remember he moved on to the next topic .
and something about energy hed mentioned which i have no idea what hed had to do with anything .
and id been struck with this and worried about it ever since .
it is probably a . i did not hear his explanation because it wa probably one of these thing to calm me down and not worry about it anymore .
whereas in my case ive worried about it ever since .
i thought maybe thats the catch .
there is something in quantum mechanic .
where these superposition become one or the other .
and thats not part of quantum mechanic .
there something missing in the theory .
the theory is incomplete .
it is not incomplete .
because if you follow the equation the basic equation of quantum mechanic thats routing the equation .
you could put that on a computer too .
there are lot of difficulty about how many parameter you have to put in .
that can be very tricky .
but nevertheless it is a computational process .
margie lowe this question about the continuum thats before but it is not clear that make any difference .
our theory of quantum mechanic may be missing the same element that the universal term machine is missing about consciousness .
yeah this is the viewer i held is that you need a theory .
and that what on people call the reduction of the stage or the collapse of the wave function which you have to have otherwise quantum mechanic doesnt relate to the world we see .
to make it relate to the world we see youve got to break the quantum youve got to break the shroening of the equation .
shroening himself wa absolutely followed by this idea .
his own equation .
thats why introduced this famous shroening a cat .
there a thought experiment .
he saying look this is where my equation lead you into it .
there something wrong .
something we havent understood which is fundamental .
and i wa trying to put all these thing together and said it is got to be the noncompetitive community come in there .
and i also can not quite remember when i thought this but it is when gravity is involved in quantum mechanic .
it is the combination of those two and at that point when you have good reason to believe this came much later .
but i have good reason to believe that the principle of general relativity and those of quantum mechanic most particularly it is the basic principle of equivalence which go back to galileo .
if you fall freely you eliminate the gravitational field .
you imagine galileo dropping his big rock and his little rock from the leaning tower whether he ever did that or not it is pretty irrelevant .
and a the rock fall to the ground youll have a little insect sitting on one of them looking at the other one .
and it seems to think there no gravity here .
of course it hit the ground and then it realized somethings different going on .
but when it is in free fall the gravity is been eliminated .
galileo understood that very beautifully .
he give his wonderful example of firework .
and the firework and explode and the sphere of sparkling firework and it remains a fear a it fall down a though there were no gravity .
he understood that principle but he couldnt make a theory out of it .
einstein came along used exactly the same principle and thats the basis of einstein general theory of relativity .
now there is a conflict this is something i did not much much later this wasnt those day much much later .
you can see there is a basic conflict between the principle of superposition i think that drag wa talking about and the principle of general cove and principle of equivalence .
can you pause for a second what is the principle of the cove line ?
it is this galileo principle that we can eliminate least locally .
you have to be in a small neighborhood because if you have people dropping rock all around the world somewhere you can not get rid of it all at once .
but in the local neighborhood you can eliminate the gravitational field by falling freely with it .
and we now see there with astronaut and they do not the earth is there you can see the great global vrthrite but they do not care about it a far a they are concerned there no gravity .
they fall freely in the gravitational field and that get rid of the gravitational field .
and thats the principle of equivalence .
whats the contradiction whats the tension whats the tension whats the supposition and let go to the next one .
we a bad track for a second to see if we can weave a thread through it all .
we started to think about consciousness a potentially needing u some of the same not mystical but some of the same imagine .
there a complicated story .
people think i am drifting away from the point or something but i think it is a complicated story .
what i am trying to say i am trying to put it in a nutshell it is not easy .
i am trying to say that whatever consciousness is it is not a computation .
or it is not a physical process which can be described by computation .
but it nevertheless could be one of the interesting model that youve proposed is the orchestrated objective reduction which is thats going from there you say .
i wrote this book through my scientific career .
i thought when i am retired i have enough time to write a a popular book which i will explain my idea and puzzle .
what i beautiful thing about physic and mathematics and this puzzle about computability and consciousness and on .
and in the process of writing this book i thought id do it when i wa retired .
i did not i wouldnt wait that long because there wa a radio discussion between edward fredkin and marvin minsky .
and they were talking about what computer could do and they were entering a big room and i imagine entering a big room with the other end of the room two computer were talking to each other .
and a you walk up to the computer they will have communicated to each other more idea concept thing than the entire human race had ever commuted that .
i thought i know you are coming from but i do not believe you .
there something missing .
thats not that i thought i should write my book .
it wa roughly the same time stephen hawking this writing his brief history of time and 80 at some point .
the book youve talked about wa the emperor new york .
and both are an incredible book the brief history of time in emperor new mind .
yes it wa quite interesting because he told me hed got some carl sagan i think to write a forward .
good the book i thought gosh what am i going to do ?
he did and he did a very nice forward .
it wa my thinking i see where they are coming from and i from that perspective .
yeah you are but thats not my perspective .
i thought i had to say it .
and a i wa writing my book i thought i do not know anything about neurophysiology .
what am i doing ?
i started reading up about neurophysiology and i read how i am not trying to find out how it is that nerve signal could possibly preserve quantum coherence .
and all i read is that the sit and electrical signal which go along the nerve create effect through the brain .
there no chance you can isolate it .
this is hopeless .
i come to the end of the book and i am more or le give up .
i think of something which i did not believe in .
thats maybe this is a way around it but no .
and then you say i thought maybe this book at least stimulate young people who do science or something .
and i got all these letter from old retired people instead .
there not only people who could have had time to read my book .
except for stuart hammer off .
thats except for stuart hammer .
stuart hammer off wrote to me and he said i think you are missing something .
you do not know about my criterion .
but that wa more or le it .
and he said this is what you need to consider .
i thought my god .
yes thats a much more promising structure .
fundamentally you were searching for the source of noncomputable source of consciousness within the human brain in the biology .
and what are my if i may ask what are my curtubials ?
i wa ignorant and what id read .
i never came across them in the book .
it looked at .
perhaps i only read rather superficially which is true .
but i know about my criterion .
stuart i think one of the thing here wa impressed him about them .
when picture of my toses thats a cell divide it .
and all the chromosome .
and the chromosome get they are all get line up and then they get pulled apart .
and that a the cell divide the half the chromosome go how they are divided into the two path .
and they go two different way .
and what is it thats pulling them apart ?
the host of these social thing got microtubials .
and he start to get interested in them .
and he formed the view when he wa and his day job or night job or whatever because it put people to sleep except he doesnt calling the sleep because it is different .
general anesthetic in a reversible way .
you want to make sure that they do not experience the pain that with other word be something that they feel .
and consciousness is turned off for a while and it can be turned back on again .
it is crucial that you can turn it off and turn it on .
and what do you do when you are doing that ?
what do general anesthetic gas do ?
and see he formed the view that it is the microtubials the effect .
and the detail of why he formed that view is not what the clever clear to me but there an interesting story he keep talking about .
but i found this very exciting because i thought these structure these little tube which inhabit pretty ourselves .
apart from red blood cell they inhabit pretty all the other cell in the body .
but they are not all the same kind .
you get different kind of microtubials .
and the one that excited me the most this is may still not be clear .
but the one that excited me most were the one that the only one that i knew about at the time because they were the very very symmetrical structure .
and i had reason to believe that these very symmetrical structure would be much better at preserving a quantum state quantum coherence preserving the thing without you need to preserve certain degree of freedom without them leaking into the environment .
once they leak into the environment you are lost .
you have to preserve these quantum state at a level which the state reduction process come in .
and thats where i think the norm of computeability come in .
and it is the measurement process in quantum mechanic .
whats going on ?
something about the measure of process and whats going on something about the structure or the microtubials your intuition say maybe there something here .
maybe this structure allows for the the mystery of the there wa a much better chance .
yeah it struck me that partly it wa the symmetry because there is a feature of symmetry you can preserve quantum coherence much better with symmetrical structure .
there that there is a good reason for that .
and that impressed me a lot .
i did not know the difference between the alighters and blighter at that time which could be important .
now that could be thats the which is not talked about but thats some in some sense detail .
weve got to take a step back to say these people are not familiar .
this this this wa called the orchestrated objective reduction idea or or or which is a biological philosophy of mine that postulate the consciousness originates at the quantum level it is a neuron .
that ha to do with your search for where where is it coming from .
thats counter to the notion that consciousness may arise from the computation performed by the synapsis .
yes the key point .
sometimes people say it is because it is quantum mechanical .
it is not that .
see it is more outrageous than that .
this is one reason i think we are far off from it because we do not even know the physic .
people say quantum system and biological structure no will you ?
it is starting to see that some basic biological system doe depend on quantum in first place all of chemistry is quantum mechanic .
people got used to that they do not count that .
it is not count let not count quantum chemistry .
we got the hang of that i think .
but you have quantum effect which are not chemical in photosynthesis .
and this is one of the striking thing in the last several year that photosynthesis seems to be a quantum process which is not simply a chemical .
it is using quantum mechanic in a very basic way .
you could start saying with photosynthesis based on quantum mechanic why not behavior of neuron and thing that ?
maybe there something which is photosynthesis in that respect .
but what i am saying is even more outrageous than that because those thing are talking about conventional quantum mechanic .
now my argument say that conventional quantum mechanic if you are following the shortening of equation thats still computable .
youve got to go beyond that .
youve got to go to where quantum mechanic go wrong in a certain sense .
you have to be a little bit careful about that because the way people do quantum mechanic is a mixture of two different process .
one of them is the schrodinger equation which is an equation a schrodinger wrote down and it tell you how the state of assistant evolves .
in his evolved according to his equation completely deterministic but it involves interredicular situation .
and this wa what schrodinger wa very much pointing out with his cat .
he say you follow my equation thats schrodinger equation and you could say that you have to you have a cat a cat which is dead in the live at the same time .
that would be the evolution of the schrodinger equation but lead to a state which is the quick cat being dead under the live at the same time .
and he more or le saying this is an absurdity .
people nowadays say what schrodinger said you can have a cat which is dead let not let see he wa saying this is an absurdity .
there something missing and that the reduction of the state or the collapse of the wave function or whatever it is it is something which ha to be understood .
it is not following the schrodinger equation .
it is not the way we conventionally do quantum mechanic .
there something more than that and it is easy to quote or authority here because einstein at least three of the greatest physicist of 20th century who were very fundamental in developing quantum mechanic einstein one of them schrodinger and other dirac and other .
you have to look carefully dirac writing because he did not tend to say this out loud too much because he wa very cautious about what he said .
you find the place and he say quantum mechanic is a provisional theory .
to be need something which explains the collapse of the wave function .
we need to go beyond the theory we have now .
i happen to be one of the kind of people there many .
there are a whole group of people .
they are all considered to be bit bit neverix who believe that quantum mechanic need to be modified .
there a small minority of those people which were a minority who think that the way in which it is modified ha to be with gravity .
and there is not even a small amount of diversity of those people who think it is particularly the way that i think it is .
those are the quantum gravity folk .
whats what ?
quantum gravity is already not this because when you say quantum gravity what you mean is quantum mechanic applied to gravitational theory .
let take this wonderful formalism of quantum mechanic and make gravity fit into it .
that is what quantum gravity is meant to be .
now i am saying youve got to be more even handed that gravity affect the structure of quantum mechanic too .
youve got to gravitate quantum mechanic and it is a two way thing .
it wa then when you even get started that you are saying that we have to figure out a new idea .
no it is your stock and have a theory .
thats the trouble .
this is a big problem .
we are watching here .
we are maybe in the very early day .
it is in the very early day .
but i making this point .
if you still have a rough sense to be penrose say that it is got to be a reduction of the state .
the trouble is penrose doesnt say that penrose say i think that .
and then we have no we have no experiment a yet which showed it is that .
there are experiment which are being thought through and which i am hoping will be performed .
if you do not bring in the gravitational effect it ha to be modified .
and then there also experiment that are underway that look at the microtubile side of thing to see if there in the biology .
you could see something that .
could you briefly mention it ?
because thats a one of the only experimental attempt in the very early day of even thinking about u . i think there a very serious area here which is what stuart hemmerff is doing and i think it is very important .
one of the few place that you can get a bit of a handle on what consciousness is is what turn it off .
and when you are thinking about general anesthetic it is very specific .
these thing turn consciousness off .
what the hell do they do ?
stuart and a number of people who work with him and others happen to believe that the general anesthetic directly affect microtubiles .
and there is some evidence for this .
i do not know how strong it is and how watertight the case but i think that it is some evidence pointing in that direction .
it is not an ordinary chemical process there something quite different about it .
and one of the main candidate is that these anesthetic gas do affect directly microtubiles .
and how strong that evidence is i wouldnt be in a position to say but i think there is fairly impressive evidence .
in the point is the experiment are being undertaken which is that is experimental .
it say it is a very clear direction where you can think of experiment which could indicate whether or not it is microtubiles which is the anesthetic gas directly effect .
thats exciting .
one of the sad thing is a far a i am from my outside perspective it is not many people are working on this .
there a very a stuart it feel there very few people are carrying the flag forward on this .
i think it is not many in the sense it is in minority but it is not zero anymore .
when stuart and i were originally we were u and a few of our friend they werent many people telling u but it is grown into one of the main viewpoint .
there might be about four or five or six different news that people hold and it is wonderful .
it is considered a one of the possible line of thinking yes .
you describe physic theory a falling into one or three category .
the superb the useful or the tentative .
i those word .
it is a beautiful categorization .
do you think well ever have a superb theory of intelligence and of consciousness ?
we are a long way from it .
i do not think we are even we are in the tentative scale .
it is you do not think we even entered the realm of tentative .
probably not .
i think thats the race .
when the controversial we do not have a clear view which is accepted by majority .
most view are computationally one form or another .
i think it is something but it is not very clear because even the iit people who think of thing this computation but ive heard them say no consciousness is supposed to be not computation .
i say if it is not coming it wouldnt hell is it ?
whats going on ?
what physical process are going on which are that ?
what is immune for something to be computationally then ?
is where there ha to be a process which is it is very curious the way the history ha developed in quantum mechanic because very early on people thought there wa something to do with consciousness but it wa almost the other way around .
you have to say the the schrodinger equation say all these different alternative happen all at once and then when is it that only one of them happens ?
one of the view which wa quite commonly held by a few distinguished quantum physicist this way of conscious being look at the system or becomes aware of it and at that point it becomes one of the other .
thats a row where consciousness is somehow actively reducing the state .
my view is almost the exact opposite of that .
it is the state reduces itself in some way which some noncomputational way which we do not understand we do not have a proper theory of and that is a building block of what consciousness is .
consciousness is the other way around .
it depends on that choice which nature make all the time when the state becomes one of the other rather than the superstition of one and the other and when that happens there is that we are saying now an element of protoconsciousness take place .
protoconsciousness is roughly speaking the building block out of which actual consciousness is constructed .
you have these protoconscious element which are when the state decides to will not do one thing or the other and thats the thing which when organized together .
and it might be something thats beautifully simple but we are completely in the dark about .
yeah i think at the moment it is thats the thing we happily put the word ork down there to say orchestrated but thats even more unclear what that mean .
it is the word material orchestrated yes we know .
and weve been dancing a little bit between the word intelligence or understanding in consciousness .
do you see those sitting in the same space of mystery a we are supposed to say ?
yes we see i tend to say you have understanding and intelligence and awareness .
and somehow understanding is in the middle of it ?
i to say could you say are there an entity that is intelligent if it doesnt have the quality of understanding ?
make sure i am using term i do not even know how to define with who care .
there some cool there some work poetic if i somehow understand them .
we do not know mathematical nature .
yes a a mathematician i do not know how to define any of them but at least i can point to the connection .
the idea is intelligence is something which i believe need understanding .
otherwise you wouldnt say it is intelligence .
and understanding need awareness .
otherwise you wouldnt say it is understanding .
do you say of an entity that understands something ?
and unless it is aware of it normal usage .
there a three awareness understanding and intelligence .
and i tend to concentrate on understanding because thats where i can say something .
and thats the girl theorem thing that .
but i wonder what doe it mean to be perceived the color blue or something ?
is it the same ?
if i see a color blue and it if you are somebody with this condition whats it called ?
or were you assigned a sound to a color blue ?
yeah thats not you get color and sound mixed up .
and that thing .
an interesting subject .
but from the physic perspective from the fundamental perspective we do not .
i think we are way off and having much understanding whats going on there .
in your two thousand and ten book cycle of time you suggest that another universe may have existed before the big bang .
can you describe this idea ?
first of all what is the big bang ?
sound a funny word .
and what may have been there before it ?
yes a a matter of terminology i do not to call it another universe .
because when you have another universe you think of it quite separate from u . but these thing they are not separate .
now the big bang conventional theory i wa growing up in the sense that when i started getting justin cosmology there wa something called the steady state model which wa philosophically very interesting .
and there wasnt a big bang in that theory .
but somehow new material wa created all the time in the form of hydrogen and the universe kept on expanding expanding expanding and there wa room for more hydrogen .
it wa a rather philosophically nice picture .
it wa disproved when the big bang when i said a big bang this wa theoretically discovered by people trying to solve einstein equation and apply it to cosmology .
he liked and i a universe which wa there all the time .
and he had a model which there wa there all the time .
but then there wa this discovery accidental discovery very important discovery on this microwave background .
and if you there the crackle on your television screen which is already sensing this microwave background which is coming at u from all direction .
and you can trace it back and back and back and back and it came from a very early stage of the universe .
it is part of the big bang theory .
the big bang theory wa when people tried to solve einstein equation .
they found you had to have this initial state .
the universe it wa used to be called the primordial atom and thing this .
there friedman and lemetra .
friedman wa a russian and lemetra wa the belgian and they independently were friedman first .
lemetra talked about the initial state which used to be very very concentrated .
and this wa state which seemed to be the origin of the universe .
from a module atom .
primordial atom is what he called it .
it wa a whole term .
and then it became friend hoyle used to turn big bang in a derogatory sense .
he said then with the shorting here in the cats. ?
yeah it is pick pick pick up on whereas it wasnt intentional originally .
but then the evidence piled up and piled up .
and my one of my friend and i learned a lot from him .
when i wa in cambridge i wa standing in a shower and he wa a very proponent of steady state .
and then he got converted to said no i am sorry .
i had a great respect for him .
you went around lecturing said i wa wrong .
the steady state model doesnt work .
and this microwave background that it is not quite the big bang .
when i said not quite it is about three hundred and eightyzero year after the big bang .
but thats what .
but then you have to have had this big bang before a in order to make the equation work .
and it work beautifully .
except for one little thing which is this thing called inflation which people had to put into it to make it work .
when i first heard of it i did not it at all .
whats inflation ?
inflation is that in the first i am going to give you a very tiny number .
think of a second .
thats not very long .
now i am going to give you a fraction of a second .
one over a number .
this number ha thirty two digit .
between let say between thirty six and thirty two digit .
tiny tiny time between those two tiny ridiculous second .
fraction of a second .
the universe wa supposed to have expanded in this exponential way .
and in an almost way for no pattern parent reason you had to invent a particular thing called the inflation field to make it do it .
and i thought this is completely crazy .
there are reason why people stuck with this idea .
the thing is that ive formed my model for reason which you are very fundamental if you .
it ha to do this very fundamental principle which is known a the second law of thermodynamics .
the second law of thermodynamics say more or le thing get more and more random a time go on .
now another way of saying exactly the same thing is thing get le and le random .
a thing go back a you go back in time they get le and le random .
you go back and back and back and back and back .
and the earliest thing you can directly see is this micro way back round .
whats one of the most striking feature of it ?
is that it is random ?
it ha the what you call this spectrum of which is whats called the planck spectrum of frequency different intensity for different frequency .
and this is wonderful curve due to max planck and whats to tell you is telling you that the entropy is a a maximum .
start a often maximum and it is going up over since .
i call that the mammoth in the room .
and the mammoth in the and people quite do not cosmologist worry about this .
i worry about it .
and then i thought it is not a paradox because you are looking at matter and radiation at a maximum entropy state .
once you are not seeing directly in that it is the gravitation .
it is gravitation which is not thermalized .
the gravitation wa very very low entropy .
and it is low entropy by the uniformity .
and that in the microwave too .
it is very uniform over the host guy .
i am compressing a long story into a very short twocent .
and doing a great job yeah .
what i am saying is that there a huge puzzle .
why wa gravity in this very low entropy state very high organized state everything else wa all random ?
and that to me there a biggest problem in cosmology .
the biggest problem ?
nobody think he worry about it .
people say they solved all the problem and they do not even worry about it .
they think inflation source .
it can not .
because it is it is it is a clever that that wa your problem with the inflation describing some aspect of the influence after the big bang .
inflation wa supposed to stretch it out and make it all uniform .
it doesnt do it because you can only do it if it is uniform already at the beginning .
it is you have to look i can not go into the detail but it doesnt solve it .
and it wa completely clear that it doesnt solve it .
but where doe the conformal cyclic cosmology of yeah we are starting to talk about something before yes that singular .
i began i wa thinking of myself how boring this universe is going to be .
youve got this exponential expansion .
this wa discovered early in the in this century twentyfirst century .
people discovered that these supernova exploding star showed that the universe is undergoing this exponential expansion .
it is a soft similar expansion .
and it seems to be a feature of this term that einstein introduced into his cosmology for the wrong reason .
he wanted a universe that wa static .
he put this new term into his cosmology to make it make sense .
it is called the cosmological constant .
and then when he got convinced that the universe had a big bang he retracted it complaining that this wa his greatest problem .
the trouble wa it wasnt a blender .
and the universe seems to be behaving with this cosmological constant .
this universe is expanding and expanding whats going to happen in the future ?
he get more and more boring for a while .
whats the most interesting thing in the universe ?
this black hole .
the black hole more or le gulp down in tower cluster of galaxy .
the class itll swallow up most of our galaxy .
we will run into our endrama the galaxy black hole .
that black hole will swallow out one .
theyll get bigger and bigger and theyll swallow out the whole cluster of galaxy .
gulp it all down .
most of it .
most of it .
thatll happen to it .
therell be these black hole around .
but still not a boring a it is going to get .
it is going to get more boring because these black hole you wait wait and you wait and wait and i am not even willing for time .
and hawking black hole of aberration start to come in .
and the black hole you it is a clever tedious .
finally evaporate away .
each one go away disappears with a pop at the end .
what could be more boring ?
that it wa boring then .
now this is boring .
there nothing not even black hole .
the universe get colder and colder and colder and colder and ever .
this is very very boring .
now there not science is it ?
but it is emotional .
i thought who going to be bored by this universe ?
not u . we will not be around .
itll be mostly photon running around .
and what the photon do they do not get bored because it is part of relativity .
it is not that they do not experience anything .
thats not the point .
the photon get out to infinity without experience any time .
thats the way the way relativity work .
and this wa part of what i used to do in my old day when i wa looking gravitational radiation and how thing behaved in infinity infinity is another place .
you can squash it down a long a you do not have any mass in the world .
infinity is another place .
the photon get there .
the graviton get there .
what do they get ?
theyve run into infinity .
they say now i am here .
what do i ?
there something on the other side ?
is there the usual view ?
it is a mathematical notion .
there nothing on the other side .
thats the boundary of it .
a nice example is this beautiful series of picture by the dutch artist mc escher .
you may know them .
the one called circle in it is very famous one with the angel and the devil .
and you can see them crowding and crowding up to the edge .
now the geometry that these angel and devil inhabit that stare infinity .
but from our perspective infinity is a car .
it is a place .
it is a ... is there a can you take a brief pause ?
and the word you are saying infinity is a place .
for the most part infinity even going back to infinity is a mathematical concept .
i think this is one of the thing that are actual physical metaphor .
in which way doe infinity ever manifest itself in our physical universe ?
it is a thing that if you are not a mathematician you think i am a finisher i can not think about that .
mathematician think about infinity all the time .
they get used to the idea and they play around with different kind of infinity and it becomes no problem .
but yeah you have to take my word for it .
now one of the thing is you take a youclose the enjormetry .
it keep on geek on geek on going and it go out to infinity .
now there other kind of geometry and this is a whats called hyperbolic geometry .
it is a bit you clearly the enjormetry is a little bit different .
it is what azure wa trying to describe in his angel and devil .
and he learned about this from coxeter .
and he think that very nice thing .
i try to represent this infinity to this geometry .
it is not quite you clearly enjormetry is a bit it that the angel and the devil inhabit .
and there infinity by this nice transformation you squash the air infinity down you can draw it a this nice circle boundary to their universe .
now from our outside perspective we can see their infinity a the boundary .
now what i am saying is that it is very that .
the infinity that we might experience those angel and devil in their world can be thought of a a boundary .
now i found this a very useful way of talking about radiation gravitational radiation and thing that .
it wa a trick mathematical trick .
now what i am saying is that that mathematical trick becomes real .
that somehow the photon they need to go somewhere because for there from their perspective infinity is another place .
now this is a difficult idea to get your mind around .
thats why i caused one of the reason because most the finding of the other trouble taking me .
but to me it is not necessarily a wild idea .
whats on the other side of that infinity ?
you have to think why am i allowed to think of this ?
because photon do not have any mass .
and we in physic have beautiful way of measuring time .
they are incredibly precise clock .
atomic and nuclear clock unbelievably precise .
why are they precise ?
because of the two most famous equation of 20th century physic .
one of them is einstein e equal mc squared .
whats that tell u ?
energy and mass are equivalent .
the other one is even older than that .
20th century only max plank e equal h new .
new is a frequency .
h is a constant again c. e is energy .
put the two together .
max plank put the two together .
absolutely basic physical principle .
if you have a massive entity a massive particle it is a clock with a very very precise frequency .
it is not you can not directly use it .
you have to scale it down your atomic and nuclear clock but thats the basic principle .
you scale it down to some that you can perceive .
but it is the same principle .
if you have mass you have beautiful clock .
but the other side of that coin is if you do not have mass you do not have clock .
if you do not have clock you do not have ruler .
you do not have space in time .
you do not have a measure of the scale of space .
scale of space .
you have space .
if you do have the structure that wa called the conformal structure it is what the angel level have .
if you look at the eye of the devil no matter how close to the boundary it ha the same shape .
but it ha a different size .
you can scale up and you can scale down but you mustnt change the shape .
it is the same idea but applied to space time .
in the very remote future you have thing which do not measure the scale but the shape if you is still there .
now thats in the remote future .
now i am going to do the exact opposite .
now a you get there thing go hotter and hotter denser and denser whats the universe dominated by ?
particle moving around almost with the speed of light .
when they get almost with the speed of light they begin to lose the mass too .
they are for completely opposite reason .
they lose the sense of scale a . my crazy idea is the big bang and the remote future they seem completely different .
one is extremely dense extremely hot .
the others very very rare if i am in very very cold .
but if you squash one down by this conformist scale and you get the other .
although they look and feel very different they are almost the same .
the remote future on the other side and in claiming a that one of the photon go they go into the next big bang .
youve got to get your mind around that crazy step on the other side of the place that is not funny. . i am saying the other side of our big bang .
back back back .
there wa the remote future of a previous eon .
previously on .
and what i am saying is that previous eon there are signal coming through to u which we can see and which we do see .
and these are both signal .
the two main signal are to do with black hole .
one of them is the collision between black hole and a they spiral into each other they release a lot of energy in the form of gravitational wave .
those gravitational wave get through in a certain form into the next eon .
thats fascinating that there is some maybe i am maybe can correct me from wrong .
but that mean that some information can travel from another eon .
that is fascinating .
ive seen some where described the discussion of the fermi paradox that if there intelligent life yes communication immediately take you there .
my colleague vahegozajan who i work with on this idea for a while we have a crazy paper on that .
look at the family paradox .
yes. . if the universe is cycling over and over and over punctuated by the punctuated the singularity the big bang .
and then intelligent or any intelligent system can communicate through from eon to eon .
why havent we heard anything from our friend ?
because we do not know how to look .
thats fundamentally the reason .
a we i do not know it is speculation .
the setty program there a reason and more thing to do but still speculation .
it is trying to say maybe not too far away with a civilization which got their first before u early enough that they could send our signal but how far away would you need to go before ?
we have little knowledge about that .
we havent seen any signal yet but it is worth looking .
it is worth looking .
and what i am trying to say here another possible place where you might look .
now you are not looking at civilization which got their first .
you are looking at those civilization which were successful probably .
a lot more success on their we are likely to be but it look and thing .
but what signal would they be ?
i havent been focused .
what to use the most beautiful idea in physic or mathematics or the art at the intersection of the two ?
i am going to have to say complex analysis .
i might have said infinity and one of the most single beautiful idea i think wa the fact that you can have infinity of different size and on .
but thats in a way i think complex analysis .
this go it is got much magic in it .
it is a very simple idea .
there no real number which ha to satisfy that .
you have to think of there a number called i. you think you invent it ?
in a certain sense it is there already .
but this number when you add that square root of minus one to it you have whats called the complex number and they are an incredible system .
in a sense thats the most magical thing ive seen in mathematics or physic and it is in quantum mechanic .
it is there already .
you might think whats it doing there ?
a nice beetle piece of mathematics and then suddenly we see nope it is the very crucial basis of quantum mechanic .
on the way the world work .
on the question of whether math is discovered or invented it sound you may be suggesting that partially it is possible that math is not indeed discovered .
no it is more archaeology than you might think .
let me ask the most ridiculous maybe the most important question .
what is the meaning of life ?
what give your life a filament purpose happiness and meaning ?
what do you think we are here on this ?
given all the big bang and the infinity is the photon that weve talked about .
i would say i think it is not a stupid question .
there are some people many of my colleague are scientist and they say thats a stupid question meaning it we hear because thing came together and produced life and on .
i think there more to it .
but what there is thats more to it .
much idea .
and it might be somehow connected to the mechanism of consciousness that we were talking about the mystery there .
and there are mystery there which are look mathematical mystery but they seem to have a bearing on the way the physical world operates .
we are scratching the surface .
we are at a long huge way to go before we understand that .
and it is a beautiful idea that the depth the mathematical depth could be discovered and then there tragedy of ghetto and completeness along the way that will have to somehow figure our way around .
roger a a huge honor to talk to you thank you much for your time today .
it is me my pleasure .
thank you .

and now let me leave you with some word of wisdom that roger penrose wrote in his book the emperor new mind .
i beneath all this technicality is the feeling that it is indeed quote unquote obvious that the conscious mind can not work a computer .
even though much of what is involved in mental activity might do this is the obviousness that a child can see .
though the child may later in life become brow beaten into believing that the obvious problem are quote unquote nonproblems .
to be argued into nonexistence by careful reasoning and clever choice of definition .
child sometimes see thing clearly that are obscured in later life .
we often forget the wonder that we felt a child when the care of the quote unquote real world have begun to settle on our shoulder .
child are not afraid to post basic question that may embarrass u a adult to ask .
what happens to each of our stream of consciousness after we die ?
where wa it before we were born ?
might we become or have been someone else ?
why do we perceive it all ?
why are we here ?
why is there a universe here at all in which we can be ?
these are puzzle that tend to come with the awakening of awareness in any of u . and no doubt with the awakening of selfawareness within whichever creature or other entity it first came .
thank you for listening and hope to see you next time .
three two one .
how are you sir ?
thank you .
doing this man .
ive been enjoying your work for many many many year .
thank you .
i appreciate that .
and i started your new book .
it is hasnt confused the shit out of me yet but i know it is coming .
it will be coming .
with all your work .
the beginning of time the beginning of the universe to the end .
thats essentially what you are summarizing .
yeah thats the backdrop to the entire narrative of the book .
i want the reader to get a feel for the whole thing .
how it started how thing you and me rise up how consciousness emerges issue of free will and whether we have it and then on to the future whats going to happen to u and the world and the universe a time elapses to the far far future ?
it is i am getting to the part where you are talking about how entropy and evolution comingle to create life .
and when you think of entropy a lot of people think of something dissolving into chaos .
yeah exactly .
but thats not necessarily the case .
it is only part of the story .
it is the thing that you want to avoid but somehow the law of physic do not allow you to avoid it .
it is this disintegration .
it is this decay .
it is this drive toward this order .
and thats true .
but the reality of the situation is more subtle because overall entropy need to go up .
but that doesnt mean there can not be little pocket of order that form along the way .
and in fact the universe is incredibly clever .
star the ubiquitous feature of the heaven they are pocket of order that naturally form but a they form they increase the entropy in the surroundings .
the net entropy go up even though this beautiful orderly bright object in the sky appears .
and it is only because of the appearance of star that the universe is an interesting place .
without star the particle of the universe would disperse the universe would get bigger and bigger colder and colder and that would be it .
there wouldnt be any structure in the universe .
it wasnt for the force of gravity .
star themselves the fact that they exist is very strange .
that you have this thing in ours is fairly small ?
it is a million time larger than earth .
and it is going to burn for billion of year .
and it is hovering there .
and it creates all the life .
literary is responsible for all the life .
and when they supernova that creates the actual ingredient for life which is even more strange you can not have biological carbonbased life if it is not for a star exploding .
we often in a poetic way said that we are made of star stuff .
thats a star .
i wa saying but you can also say that we are made of nuclear refuse ?
we are the detritus that the deaththrows of a star put out into the universe and it rain down on planet .
and at least on one such planet that stuff come together in yield life .
it is a cycle .
i want to sound the lion king here but it is what it is .
what i am interested in about getting into your book is the fact that you are detailing all these step that have to take place in order for all this life in order for this universe to be what it is and then where it is going to go .
and the remarkable thing and the main point at some level is that look we are special entity .
we can think we can reflect we have emotion .
but ultimately you and i and everybody else were bag of particle that are governed by physical law .
and there this continuity between the stuff of the world the inanimate stuff of the world the inanimate stuff of the heaven and u . we all come from the same fundamental ingredient and the same fundamental law .
now some people find that that give them i do not know a sense of desperation a sense of or not special a sense that somehow the universe is pointless or meaningless .
but my view on this is it is spectacular that we are made of the same stuff that make up this bottle of water or any of the wonderful statue you have on this desk .
because that mean that how remarkable that collection of particle can do what we do .
and i think thats the way of looking at the continuity .
we do not need to be endowed with some special quality by some external entity .
you do not need that .
particle can do miraculous thing .
and that is the message that i think you can draw from a more complete understanding of where we came from and where we are going .
that the fear of death and the attitude of the finite life being insignificant that what is the point ?
it is existential angst that many of u struggle with ?
thats something that you touch upon early on .
this thing that make u unique is that we know that we are going to die .
that to me is the vital distinguishing feature of our specie .
we can reflect on the past .
we can think about the future and recognize that we are not going to be here in the future at least for some period of time .
and it is an idea and it is powerful motive any influence .
one that ha been explored throughout the age .
otto ranc wa one of the early disciple of freud who ultimately broke with freud developed this thesis that our awareness of our own mortality is one of the driving factor in what we do .
and then when i wa i do not know it wa in my 20 or 30 . i read a book by a guy named ernest becker called denialet death .
i am going to be a very hurt of this book .
it wa big in the 70 and one the pulitzer prize in the 70 . and it is a wonderful distillation of this way of thinking about why we human do what we do .
and in many way in my own book the one thats coming out today until the end of the time it is extending this notion that becker developed in denialet death .
but now seeing it in a cosmological setting .
because it is not we that are going to die .
it is every structure in the universe is going to disintegrate in time .
our our best theory suggests to u that even proton the very heart of matter their quantum process that in the far future will ensure that every proton disintegrates fall apart into it constituent particle .
and that point there no complex matter around at all .
what what what what what timeline are we talking about ?
in fact id to use a metaphor to try to give you a feel for the time involved .
i to use the empire stapling .
and imagine that every floor of the empire stapling represents a duration ten time out of the previous floor .
on the ground floor it is one year first floor ten you are second floor one hundred and forth .
you are going exponentially far in time a you climb up the empire stapling .
and in that scheme of thing everything from the big bang until today you are about at the 10th floor ten to the ten year ten billion year .
and a you go forward you are looking at thing very far in the future and to answer your question we think and i underscore think because we are now at the speckled event of our theoretical idea proton will decay roughly and say by the 38th floor .
ten to the thirty eight year into the future .
we can relax for a little bit .
you can relax for a little bit .
but here the thing the amazing thing obviously is it sound tripe a time is relative ?
any duration that seems long it is only long by comparison to another duration .
and on say the scale of the entire empire stapling up to say ten to the one hundred year into the future which is what the peak would represent ten to the thirty eight year is le than the blink of an eye .
it is nothing on those scale .
you start to have to be careful whether you are intuition .
if you are willing to entertain the fantastic long timescales that you necessarily need to if you are going to think about the very far future .
is there speculation a to what happens when proton do ceased to exist ?
we anticipate that all complex structure will fall apart .
if there are any star left over we believe that by the 14th floor most star will have used up their nuclear fuel .
there will be dark ember smokey out there in the cosmos .
but if they are still hovering around by the 38th floor they will all dissipate into their particulate ingredient .
it is hard to imagine .
pas say floor thirty eight .
that there going to be any life for any mind or any complex astronomical structure out there in the universe .
the window within which the universe a we know it exists is small when you think about it in term of the entire cosmic timeline .
impossible to understand the actual span of it because it is long but yet small .
in the human mind .
it is very hard to hold these duration in mind .
i do not i do not feel ive been thinking about this stuff for a long time .
i do not feel i have an intuition for the duration that we are talking about .
in fact the empire state building that little analogy help me to give some relative sense of when thing of interest will happen in the universe .
but we are good at understanding day week month year the time of conventional experience .
we have no basis for understanding the universe over these scale that weve never experienced .
and thats true not only for time it is also for space ?
we have very good intuition about everyday phenomenon .
if i have to take this bottle of water i throw out a tube youd catch it .
where to put your hand you wouldnt have to calculate it newtonian trajectory to figure out where the water is going .
but if i wa to do the same thing with electron you do not have a neitherdoeye quantum intuition about the wave function and the probability that govern how a particle electron behaves .
and thats simply because we were unfortunately or fortunately born a big creature relative to the scale of quantum mechanic .
and because of that our intuition wa never under any evolutionary pressure to understand how electron behave .
in fact i to say those of our forebear wondering around the african of anna who started to think about electron in quantum mechanic they got eaten ?
they are the one who gene did not propagate onward .
and therefore those of u who are the beneficiary of the survival of our ancestor were good at understanding newtonian physic but were not good at understanding anything else about the deep reality of the world .
do you anticipate that someday in the future whatever is next after human being will be able to understand these concept ?
because if you stop and think about what human is weve only been this for x amount of one hundredzero year .
and it is a good question .
and it is a tough one .
i can at least imagine that a a possibility .
what it would take to get there and whether our specie will ever last long enough to have that an impact on our intuition .
i do not know but it is all about experience and survival .
we have been programmed by evolution not to understand the true nature of the world .
weve been programmed by evolution to survive .
and those are two radically different proposition because you do not need to know the true nature of reality to survive .
it is a distinct attribute .
and one that is not necessarily one that ha any survival value to understand black hole or the big bang or general activity or quantum mechanic or entropy or thermodynamics .
these quality we develop a we go forward and try to understand the world go beyond mere survival and figure out thing that excite u but it is not something which obviously ha any survival value .
whats interesting is also how relatively recently people have been pondering these idea in a a quantifiable way .
we can write thing down and express it with other scientist and try to figure out who and who wrong in term of these calculation .
but human being when did we start pondering the scope of the universe ?
pretty recently .
if you think about the beginning of modern physic you can start with galileo you can start with newton but in any event we are talking on the order of hundred of year .
and then a couple hundred year after that we migrate from that understanding which is an encapsulation of the pattern that we can all discern with the naked eye .
and that progression only took say a couple hundred year .
and thats where weve gotten .
it is spectacular that we being who are coming of age here in the milky way galaxy can sit down with a piece of paper and a calculation of pencil .
and we can figure out magnetic property of particle electron to ten decimal place .
thats shocking .
it is stunning .
and it is something that i think all of u should be very proud of that our specie have been able to accomplish that .
somehow i know that i do not think i am responsible .
i do not feel any of my people are at home .
no it is a collective effort .
and thats a beauty of science .
in the end of the day it is not that most scientist are ever going to be remembered .
you stop someone in the street and ask them to name a scientist .
yeah they may say hawking they may say einstein .
thats it i think for most people .
and i do not think thats a bad thing per se because it is not about the personality or the people that have pushed the frontier of understanding .
it is the fact that weve got this body of insight that continues to grow and can to allow u to manipulate and understand the natural world .
and i think thats what it is all about .
do not you think that there are some personality yourself feynman neil degrasse tyson that because of their personality because they are their charismatic people .
it make more people intrigued about these possibility and make more people attracted to the idea .
we teach toward assessment .
and if you want to figure out how to flatten a kid interest in these teach some stuff and tell them you are going to be tested on this on tuesday .
you are going to have to spit about everything that youve learned .
i find it heartbreaking the way in which much intrinsic interest in these idea you can see it a five or six year old ?
i to say we begin a little scientist .
we are exploring the world but trying to figure thing out .
and then we go into the educational system .
and it is not by malice .
it is by the nature of how we teach in the current approach to educational philosophy that many kid wind up seeing these idea a a burden .
something i do not want to have to spend time learning about part of the sale or how to balance reaction .
i see with my own kid ive got fifteen year old son at twelve year old daughter and all they are motivated by is next wednesday quiz .
and i am hey these idea are they are exciting .
they are wonderful .
i want to know enough i can do on the quiz .
and once the quiz is over they leave the idea behind .
when did these idea become a tractor to you ?
i wa i do not know not unusual for a scientist but unusual i think in the spectrum of kid in the world because at five or six year old i wa captivated by mathematics. ?
yeah five or six .
my dad wa a composer .
he wa a he wa a comedian .
he wa in the early day we go around the country and with a harmonica group and a stage show that thats what he did .
he liked to say that he wa an sphd a sword park high school dropout .
at at tenth grade he hit the road .
but he loved scientific idea .
he taught me the basic of arithmetic when i wa about five year old .
and then i would ask him to set me problem and hed give me these thirty digit number by thirty digit number .
id write the man in big construction paper and id spend the weekend calculating away on these huge arithmetic problem of no interest to anybody on planet earth .
but to me the fact that you could learn a little piece of math and then do something that nobody had ever done before that wa exciting to me a a kid and thats what got me going .
you chose the path .
yeah personality whatever it is that it is to do .
you always wonder about that .
i do not know if you wonder i wa wondering how can you not ?
what what would have happened if x would have transpired instead of y ?
and in fact i have to say when i graduated college i had a period of i do not know depression is too strong a word for it .
but a period of what have i done ?
i went to college .
how did you get past that ?
i wa given a second chance .
i won a scholarship to go to england oxford and it ostensibly wa to study physic .
but when i got there i realized that i wa completely free to do whatever i wanted to do at that point and i took a year to study literature .
i went to the physic class i wa showing up but i wasnt focused on it at all and instead i wa focused i got an england it is a tutorial system .
i got a tutor which is somebody at the college that set you assignment and you write paper .
you go in and you read your paper out loud .
it is not something we turned it in and it is graded .
it is a very personal experience .
you write something and you are delivering it to this individual that is going to help you in your educational journey .
and thats what i did for a year .
at the end of the year i had to myself ive got it .
this time that you took off this year we need to take it off but you changed path .
yeah how beneficial wa that for you ?
do you think it helped you appreciate what your original subject of interest wa a ?
yeah hugely because it is funny .
it is the flip side of something i often encounter with people that are interested in science but do not know the math .
and they always say or some say i am never going to understand this body of science because i do not know the mathematics .
and i try to convince them look at some level thats true .
if you want to do research in the general theory of relativity youve got to learn differential geometry in all the tensor calculus but if you are interested in the idea you can grasp the idea without the technical background .
i try to demystify something that can seem impenetrable because you have an entered the field .
and i think the same thing happened to me in reverse for the more humanistic exploration .
it had this aura of of grandeur that i wa unable to penetrate because id never immersed myself in the idea .
and by spending a year in those idea it did not diminish them in any way but i felt it brought it back down to earth a another journey toward truth another pathway toward insight .
and one that you do not have to have a degree in .
you do not have to know the in and out of the academic version of that subject to understand it and grasp it and spend some time thinking about it .
you think that for people studying anything particularly those studying science and mathematics very rigid discipline do you think that they all could benefit from expanding their education into philosophy or art or something that us your mind in a different way ?
but for i think for many others and certainly for me look i a most people do but not all but ive learned early on that i am not going to be an albert einstein .
i can make contribution and i have had contribution to it fails string theory and cosmology but they are never going to be at the level of shattering our understanding of the world thing that people are going to talk about five hundred year from now thats unlikely .
and i think for somebody that who able to make contribution but pulling away from the technical work is not going to extract some vital insight into the nature of the world that otherwise wouldnt be discovered .
i think there is great value in doing exactly what you are saying because by broadening your perspective on what the work you are doing is revealing .
it is part of the human quest for understanding and seeing it a an isolated discipline where it is all about the next equation and the better unified theory or the deeper understanding of the big bang to see that a isolated from the human quest for understanding .
i think to menace the work that we a physicist do .
wa that a part of your initial ambition ?
yeah one is something that we rocked the world .
yeah to go back to the comment that you made before about we being the only specie that know that we are going to die .
a part of it is a symbolic immortality .
you create something that will last .
you create something that will have such impact that it will stick around for a long long period of time .
i think yes part of my motivation in doing physic wa not merely to get the next decimal place in this or that physical quantity described in the natural world .
it wa to try to have some insight that would rock our understanding of the world and have reverberation that would echo out for many many year to come .
thats interesting .
did that torture you somewhat ?
doe that something that would haunted you in your head all the time ?
not but an ultimate ambition .
but ultimate ambition yeah for sure .
and look i think when when you are doing any work whatsoever the daytoday the moment to moment is a grind .
i do not know how you find it in the work that you are doing but if i am working on a research project even if in principle the idea are grand and wonderful embold the moment to moment is calculating away .
it is trying to figure out that equation .
it is putting an equation on a computer .
it is not sexy .
it is not something that ha that glorious quality that you might ultimately describe when you are finished and you look back and you think about the implication of your work .
the moment to moment of almost anything that you do is i think thats ultimately what is the driver of whatever you are doing in your life the moment to moment .
but yeah there wa certainly a part of me that would have a desire a hope that the work would reverberate in a powerful way .
i think thats true for most physicist that notion that you can sit at a table and think and change the way we understand reality the way einstein did the way schrödinger did the way neils board .
but what percentage of people have that revelation ?
yeah i think it is pretty few and far between .
and what else is contributing ?
and then occasionally someone exactly some light bulb go off powerful new insight and you are everything ha suddenly changed .
thats exciting though .
and it is what keep you going .
to be the person who ha the light bulb .
yeah but i tell my student and especially young student who come in there are still trying to figure out what they want to do if you are not satisfied with contributing .
if you are not satisfied with being part of the journey but not the person at the head of the breakthrough it is probably not the field for you because it is unlikely because it is not brainpower .
it is thinking of the question it is thinking of thing in the orientation .
it is being at the place at the time with the dna that somehow is a tune to the question thats being asked .
it is not even fully under your control .
it is not a matter of exercising your mind and building up the muscle of the brain in such a way that you are the strongest person to contribute to this in this idea .
it is luck it is timing .
it is being there when the question being asked and you happen to see the way forward .
thats it is interesting to me that there many people working on all this stuff and that the average person that doesnt contemplate quantum physic or any of these equation we have no idea it is going on .
and that this all this work thats critical to our understanding of what the universe is with the very fiber of the universe itself .
all this is going on and most people are they are reaping the residual benefit of it .
but they are wandering around and not knowing .
in fact there a number thats quoted that quantum mechanic is responsible for something thirty five of the gross national product .
it is it is in a very concrete way .
now the problem with that number is i recently looked it up to find the source of it .
i went online and checked it out .
and apparently i am the source of this number .
and i assure you that ive not done a calculation that fully justifies this .
but roughly speaking anything that ha an integrated circuit is the result of beneficiary of quantum insight .
we use this stuff every moment of our technological life .
and yet a you say for the most part most of u do not have a deep understanding of the reality thats responsible for the gadgetry that the science ha given rise to .
and it is a strange quantum mechanic is an utterly strange reality .
two strange .
ive tried many many time tried to understand whether it is sean carroll book or yours or any one .
and again it go back to our brain werent under pressure to think quantum mechanically .
but i assure you you give me a couple of hour .
book are one thing because it is a one sided conversation .
but you give me a couple of hour in a back and forth .
and i will absolutely get you to a place where you appreciate and have a sense of what these idea are telling u about the nature of the world .
here the thing that ive always wanted to ask someone you .
what do you think wa happening before the big bang ?
it is a it is a deep question and a subtle one .
and there two way that id to think about that question .
one a it could be that the big bang wa an interesting event but not the first event in the totality of reality .
it could have been the first event that sparked the expansion of our part of space .
but it could be that there a grander realm of space within which we set a a small part and that grander realm may have been there for a far longer period of time .
it may have experienced it own big bang maybe a collection of big bang that may extend infinitely far into the past .
it could be that the answer to the question of what happened before the big bang is a lot of other big bang or a lot of other quantum event that were taking place in a larger landscape of reality than we have direct access to .
however another answer is that the very question may not make a much sense a the word seem to suggest .
we know how to parse that sense .
we know what it mean to talk about the moment before the big bang because we know how to talk about the moment before your birth or the moment before the civil war or the moment before any event that happened the world .
we fully understand the meaning of that sentence .
but it could be that when it come to the big bang the sentence doesnt mean anything .
it could be that the big bang wa the place where time itself started and hawking himself had a wonderful analogy to get this across .
ill dress it up a little bit .
imagine you are walking on planet earth and you pas by something and you say hey can you point me in the direction of north ?
i want to walk in the north with direction .
they point you continue to walk you pas by somebody else .
say hey which way is further north and they point you in that direction ?
but when you get to the north pole and talk to somebody there and say hey how do i go further north ?
they look at you and say whoa that question doesnt mean anything because this is where north begin .
there no notion of going further north than the north pole and it could be that that spatial metaphor applies to time .
talk about a billion year ago or a ten billion year ago but if you go to a thirteen.eight billion year ago the big bang that may be where time started and you can not go further back in time than the very origin of time itself .
that freak me out .
see that ?
thats one that get in your head and you would mean beginning of time .
why would time have a beginning ?
and it could be it could be the time is an emergent quality of reality .
i give you an analogy boy what by that is we all know what temperature mean intuitively .
somethings hot you feel it is somethings cold you feel it your body understands those concept .
what physic ha done is it is gone deeper into the concept of temperature and revealed that it is nothing but the average motion of the particle making up the environment .
if the molecule are moving quickly youve got a hot environment .
if the molecule are moving slowly it is a cold environment .
temperature emerges from the motion of particle .
if you have one particle you can not talk about it being hot or cold because you need a conglomerate you need a glomerate of particle to be able to talk about their average motion .
and in that sense temperature is this emergent idea that rest upon more fundamental idea the molecule and atom that make up reality .
maybe thats true of time .
maybe time a we know it is a property that only make sense in certain environment when there enough stuff arranged in the pattern .
but fundamentally maybe there are atom or molecule of time which when not arranged in the form that we are familiar with do not yield time a we know it .
time itself may be a quality of the world that exists here in this environment but doesnt even apply in other environment that are configured radically differently .
thats a heavy one .
yeah thats a heavy one .
we would also say heavy one is what caused the big bang .
yeah why would something smaller than the head of a pin ?
become everything that we see in the cosmos .
there are idea for the answer to that question .
look all of this is tentative because it is very hard to do measurement that go all the way back to the beginning .
we have astronomical observation that we need to be sure are compatible with the prediction of our theory in forth .
we is good scientist do what need to be done to try to test these idea .
but the idea that i think most physicist are cosmologist by into at the moment is that gravity can have two manifestation .
the usual form of gravity that you and i know about is the attractive version .
you drop something toward the earth and it move downward because the earth and the object pull on each other .
thats the ordinary gravity that we experience every day of our life .
but einstein equation allow gravity to also be repulsive .
it can push outward a opposed to pulling inward .
and this is something that we have never experienced because the gravity created by a rocky object the earth is always the attractive variety .
the gravity created by the sun again compact object is always the attractive variety .
but einstein math show that if you do not have a rocky object thats isolated in space but rather energy that is uniformly spread through a region of space that that entity yield repulsive gravity .
why is that important to your question ?
if the very early universe that little tiny head of a pin that you are talking about if it wa filled with a uniform bath of this energy we call it the infloton field .
the name doesnt matter .
but if it wa filled with that energy it would have been subject to repulsive gravity .
what doe repulsive gravity do ?
push everything apart cause everything to rush outward .
the bang of the big bang may have been a spark of repulsive gravity operating with a tiny region of space that pushed everything apart .
and this concept of repulsive gravity is theoretical .
we observed any element in the universe that it is theoretical .
but it is at a level of understanding that i think most physicist would say cause it to migrate into the camp of established understanding of how gravity work .
number one einstein equation have now been tested over and over again in a whole variety of circumstance .
the detection of gravitational wave a couple of year ago is the crowning triumph of einstein math .
the hundred year ago the math say there should be ripple in the fabric of space a hundred year later .
we finally detect ripple in the fabric of space .
we are very comfortable with any prediction that come out of einstein mathematics .
and in the mathematics is the prediction of what i wa described .
youve got uniform energy and a region repulsive gravity .
the other thing is we currently witness that the expansion of the universe is speeding up not slowing down .
since the 1920s everybody thought that yes the universe is expanding but it will slow down over time .
because gravity pull thing back together .
you throw an apple upward .
it doesnt go up faster and faster .
it go up slower and slower because the earth gravity pull it back .
everybody thought that would apply to the universe a a whole .
it is expanding but expanding ever slower .
the observation in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight culminated in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight which won the two thousand and eleven nobel prize showed that the distant galaxy are moving way ever more quickly .
the expansion of space is speeding up over time .
it is accelerating .
how do we explain that ?
the best explanation we currently have is repulsive gravity .
we believe even today the universe is suffused with the bath of energy .
we call it dark energy .
we believe it is uniformly going through space .
i to think of it almost a a a turkish sauna .
it is the steam filling the sauna this energy filling space .
and that repulsive gravity we believe is responsible for the observation that the distant galaxy are rushing way faster and faster over time .
it is circumstantial but the case for repulsive gravity is quite strong .
and what would have caused it to coal ?
what would have caused it to compress initially ?
why would all that matter be in this tiny le than the pin sized object ?
nobody else on planet earth ha any real idea .
but we do have theory .
one of the theory suggests that in the very early universe it wa a highly chaotic environment .
very hot with all the field fluctuating wildly up and down .
and the idea would be that if you wait long enough we are it is hard to know what wait mean in this environment but do not press me on my definition of time back then .
if you wait long enough on rare occasion the energy will happen to flatten out in a region become uniform and then that region explosively inflates .
imagine you are looking at a pot of boiling water .
the surface is of course widely undulating up and down .
but if you wait long enough very long time since youve never seen it neither of i there will be a little patch on the surface of that boiling water that flattens out .
that only mean that the water molecule happen for an instant to be moving in the way to keep that little patch of water from wildly bubbling .
it will happen it is a rare but if you wait long enough it will occur .
similarly the widely undulating field in the early universe if you wait long enough a patch will flatten out .
you get the uniform energy plug it in time time equation that region explosively inflates .
and explosively it can go from size thats much le than an atomic diameter to larger than the observable universe in far le than a blink of an eye .
in ten to the minus thirty ten to the minus thirty five second .
thats how powerful rebel of gravity can be .
that is baffling .
before that before this happens you have in this theory you have all of this energy randomly interacting with other energy in the universe with no physical object .
it is could have been forever .
that could in fact thats the main point .
there nobody who is hanging around looking at their watching .
good god when is this big bang going to finally happen ?
you can have this cosmological preshow .
you can have it last a long a you .
the only thing that you need to happen is that sooner or later a region flat end out and then the cosmological show begin .
and if we are looking at this model of the universe being this infinite universe yeah with different characteristic and different quality to them this could be happening throughout infinity .
yeah all over the place .
and in fact this called inflation cosmology is the technical name for the subject say that it say that it is quite likely that this explosive inflation of the region that we currently inhabit it wa one of many such event .
and therefore there are other farflung region throughout this larger cosmological landscape where thing have also inflated but the detail can be different .
the physical detail can differ from what we are familiar with .
and the difference can be small temperature difference in one part of space versus another or they can be far more significant even the particle that make up that other realm may be different from the particle that make up our realm .
their mass can be different .
their charge can be different .
their fundamental physical feature can be different .
out there in that wider cosmological landscape it can be the wild wild west of reality .
and they do not have to worry about proton deterioration .
there may be realm in which they do not have to worry about proton falling apart .
you come to these crazy sounding scifi sounding idea that you and i are having this conversation out there in other distant realm .
and this is not an overworked theorist imagination .
this is the careful dispassionate analysis of the mathematical equation .
now i should say there are some physicist who see this implication and say whoa you guy have fallen off the deep end .
your theory ha imploded because any theory that predicts that a wealth of reality that are untestable because they are far away that we will never interact with them .
thats a theory that we have been trained to avoid to exercise .
however the more forward thinking i to describe u physicist say hey math ha proven to be a very valuable guide over the course of hundred of year .
and if this is where the math is taking u it is at least worthy of our attention to investigate it fully and possibly come to the conclusion that this is how reality behaves .
thats the weirdest one .
the weirdest one .
it is when people talk about intelligent life someone in the universe that you are out there or the version of you or infinite version of you .
yeah and it can be disturbing .
what do you mean by you ?
if there are many of yous out there each of whom ha an equal claim on being you because theyve had the same experience .
they have the same memory .
and maybe have made infinite variation in the decision that youve made through your life .
you could meet a brian green your age somewhere out there in the universe thats made a choice .
or the wrong one .
become a gambling addict .
yeah it is they start to accept u . weve got weve got spock and evil spock .
the one that had the little beard on. . this is going to be a little beard and version of me .
it go out there .
yeah and the thing i want to stress is this sound cookie .
and the danger of cookie sounding idea and physic is that there are people who then jump off for it and say if thats possible then then this is possible .
maybe i can with my mind effect what other people are .
there all sort of crazy idea that can be inspired by the weird insight of modern physic .
and youve got to keep straight whats real and whats ridiculous .
yeah thats a problem. . when people start using especially if there are articulate let start using scientific lingo to describe thing that are very unscientific .
what the bleep .
what the bleep .
but that wa one of those movie where a lot of people there wa all this quantum talk and yeah .
dr. quantum wa in it .
the whole cartoon is particle and wave .
and they are they are science behind this .
but then at the end of it it wa something that wa created by someone who run a cult who belief they are channeling someone who a thousand year old alien that whole ramp thing .
a couple year ago i wa in middle of a big project .
in fact i described this in the end of the book .
youll get to this little anecdote if you choose to carry on reading .
i wa in the middle of a big project and speaking opportunity came in and i did not properly vet it .
the money looked good and looked a fine thing and i signed off on it .
and then a few day before i am going i realized it is to go to talk to judy zebra knight who channel romptha the thirty fivezero year old memorian sage .
and i said to the folk who should have been checking in on this the lecture agent i can not go .
and they are hey brian it is tomorrow .
it is too late to back out .
i look at some video online and i see her on the murr griffin show where she channel romptha on live television .
i do not know what year this wa .
she snap her head forward and go back .
she change her voice .
it becomes something between the queen and yoda .
there a weird place that shes old .
hello being and shes talking to murr griffin .
he talking about an airplane .
she go what doe airplane ?
it is that thing .
anyway i go and i show up .
and the first thing i see is they are all these people walking around a grassy field but they are arm out this .
and i am can they see you are a and i get closer .
they are all blindfolded .
and i am saying that what what is going on here and they describe that each person ha a card around their neck where theyve written down their life dream .
and an exact copy of that card ha been put out on this big field .
and they have to feel their way toward the matching card .
and if they succeed this show that this goal or desire is going to come to pas .
and i am saying to those guy hows it going ?
one person found their card .
in the last few month the odds of probability of that happening are not unreasonable but thats all that this is .
and then they take me to the blindfolded archer .
they are taking bow and arrow and they are firing at these target .
and man i am standing way back on this thing .
and they ask me do you want to try it ?
and i wa there a photographer thats come along .
i am no ill avoid that .
and then they introduce me to this woman who is able to predict the next card in a in a shuffle deck .
and she would pull out this card and shed say it is going to be seven of club .
and it is a three of spade .
and then the next one is a seven of diamond .
and you go there the seven that i wa talking about one card before .
this is crazy circumstance where and then i go i go to give my talk .
because thats why i wa there after all .
this wa the preamble they were showing me what they do .
i walk into this barn .
and i across the threshold of barn and they all give me a standing ovation .
and i am thats appreciated .
but why are you giving me a standing ovation ?
and i go in and i start to give my talk .
and i and i say to them straight out what ive seen here is nut .
i say if you are going to try to predict next card in a deck one hour or four time well get the suit .
one hour thirteen time we get the rank .
there nothing in there but the pure probabilistic law of mathematics they rise up and give me a standing ovation .
and i say it is appreciated .
but why are you applauding ?
i am telling you that you are wasting your time .
and they applaud me again .
and i am this is weird .
but then i go to the book signing i finish my talk and the book signing these people they come up with me and they they talk real soft and say there a lot of crazy stuff thats happening in this place .
but we come here because we feel that there something else in the world and we want to be around minded individual that are searching for the deeper truth .
thank you for calling out the silliness thats happening here .
but well come here anyway and spend our money because we want to be part of the journey .
and i have to tell you i had a degree of sympathy for them because i get the motivation .
a a physicist what we do is we are revealing strange feature of the world .
i get the urge i get the desire that the problem is that the methodology thats being employed is something that will never take you closer to the truth .
however much you may feel that you are among minded individual .
i get the motivation .
i get this sensation i get the urge but it is tragic that these individual feel that this an undertaking is a pathway that will take them toward the deeper truth .
and let me finish up .
after this they take me to the dinner .
and the dinner and imagine at the top of the hill and thats where judy i am probably going to get suit for this conversation but ?
but ive never talked about it .
yeah they are quite litigious .
are they ?
no they are definitely are .
anyway there a one person opinion .
they take me to the mansion at the top of the hill .
and thats where she is .
she doesnt come down and participate in the talk .
shes watching it on close circuit television up in the mansion .
and i walk in and she hug me .
but it wa too goddamn long of a hug .
i am saying it wa and she wa thank you .
it wa this big emotional thing .
is this all still going on ?
it wa a couple of year ago .
i imagine if shes channeling it .
we are missing thats .
that would certainly rewrite every rule of reality every law of physic that i understand .
would that be le weird than the big bang itself ?
it is a pcc .
when it come to the big bang i can sit down with the mathematics that i understand .
and i can follow the deductive chain of reasoning that get u to some of these strange implication that we are talking about multiple big banges or the reality and forth .
when it come to channeling a thirty fivezero year old sage i do not know what the hell that even mean .
i do not understand the physical process by which that could possibly happen .
i do not understand how there could have been a being of the sort that shes channeling alive thirty fivezero year ago because it doesnt have any agreement with the archaeological record .
it is what they do is they they curate idea and then they run them through their filter of woo woo .
and then they distributed in a very palatable way that attracts people .
that movie .
i tell a story ive told this before .
i apologize to people who heard it .
there wa a friend of mine at the comedy store had a friend that i do not know her name but she came to the comedy store and she wa happy and i am shes i am happy .
she go because i found the secret .
and now that i know about the secret i am going to be married i am going to be this .
i am going to have this fulfilled life .
i am going to reach my dream and i am excited about that .
and at the time i had seen the movie and then i wa starting to understand the criticism of the movie .
i wa reading all these the account here .
we are scientist .
we are breaking down all the thing that were wrong .
and i did not dash your dream .
i wa wow. . and then i saw a year later .
the outside of another one of my show a different comedy club .
it is thing are not going the way i thought .
i thought because of the secret that everything would be grave in my dad is still a pain in the as .
and when that he moved in with me he doesnt have any money .
and i can not establish a good relationship .
but i do not have the job that i wanted .
i do not understand because ive been using the secret .
i think about it every day .
and i said here my take on this .
if you talk to someone who very successful and you say to them hey how did you get very successful ?
and they say i thought about it all the time .
i have a vision board .
i took that photo of the house that i wanted .
i put it in the vision board .
that became my house .
i took this idea .
i want a beautiful wife .
i want a family .
i want sport car .
and this and that .
and now i have those thing because the mind is a powerful tool .
and the mind can create reality .
but you are talking to someone who is successful .
how many people thought that and nothing happened ? .
i bet there many you have a you have a bias in successful user .
those are the one that you are talking to .
and because of the fact that theyve been able to have these extraordinarily successful life while visualizing these thing doe not mean that visualizing these thing creates an extraordinarily successful life .
you have to think and you have to act and you have to do. . and there trial and error and there a lot of lesson to be learned .
but if you wanted to simplify it at the end once you are successful and boil it down to a philosophy that you could sell a course on .
thats what it would be .
thats exactly .
look there nothing wrong with visualizing success .
but that is not the causal ingredient that will yield the success .
the thing that come to mind is i do not know if they do it any longer .
but there wa certainly a time when olympic athlete would be taught to visualize say jump and over that high bos and theyd run through the whole thing .
but thats not all that they were doing .
they were doing ten hour a day of training that integrated this visualization a part of the training program .
it is tragic when people buy into these these crazy idea .
and i have to tell you when they were making that film they called me to be in it .
and i think it wa the director one of the producer i wa on the phone with and they were describing what they were doing .
and i probed sufficiently hard .
and some of my friend did not probe sufficiently hard .
and we are in the film and we read it .
but i probed sufficiently hard .
and i said look what you are doing to me sound dangerous .
it sound a bad thing to be doing .
and they took offense in that call back then .
a year after the film came out it wa either the director produced i can not remember the gentleman name called me up .
and he said i want to apologize to you .
you were absolutely .
i have finally realized what a bad film this wa to be involved in .
and i completely regret it .
that i do not think is the point of view of the the romped the school of enlightenment which is behind this or at least part of what wa behind this .
but at least the director or the producer whoever it wa saw the light and realized that this is not the information that you want to put out in the world because it can change people life in a very negative way .
i think you are a comparison to olympic athlete is very good because the olympic athlete are visualizing something that they already do .
what there a great benefit and visualizing for athletics for martial art for a lot of different thing .
visualizing success visualizing potential problem failure of your process how you are going to adjust on the fly all those thing are great because then when thing do take place in real life situation youve already prepared for them .
the path .
thats what thats all about .
i agree that .
and in fact i have to tell in one of the chapter later chapter of the book i describe theory about why it is that we for instance tell fictional story .
could there be any evolutionary value in two individual telling each other a story that they both know a false that they know ha no connection to the world around them but yet weve been doing that since the emerges of language .
and there are these interesting evolutionary scenario in which what you are saying is brought to bear in that unfamiliar context .
we tell story because it is the mind way of rehearsing for the real world but it is a way of rehearsing for the real world .
thats completely safe .
you can go on all sort of crazy journey to the underworld up into the cloud .
you can engage in all sort of battle .
all these thing can take place within your imagination .
there value in visualizing .
there value in telling story but it is not the causal part that some individual would want u to believe it is .
yeah the only thing that i would say contrary to that is some people develop expectation based on fictional account .
yeah and there a real problem romantic movie where some people will expect behavior that exists in these romantic movie only. . and it is not indicative of human being in the real world .
it is strange to me that we desire those .
someone who posse power beyond anything known to human being or any life form .
yeah i get that .
i love to snap your finger and fix everything .
and therefore there something deeply seductive about the possibility of a being that can transcend the limitation that we mere mortal are always subject to .
i think it is built into our dna to respond to the way that we do and the amount of that we do when encountering a hero in the world .
there joseph campbell .
the power of myth but is more technical version to hear with a thousand face .
he go through the whole notion of what it is to have a myth and it is basking an individual .
it is call to action to rise above the kind of activity that mere mortal will be able to undertake .
resist the call at first but then rise to the challenge go out into the world conqueror come back a changed individual and shake up the reality from which that individual initially emerged on this journey .
it is it is fascinating when you think of how many different language and how many different culture share those same archetypal theme .
and i do think it all come if you look way back into the history of the idea it come from this initial recognition that we are mortal .
and the fact that our brain are able to not fix on the moment but can think about the entire timeline is the one that make that a poignant realization .
and if we couldnt think about the future who would it matter if we knew that we were going to die ?
the fact that we can undertake all of these expression of creative will and the desire to transcend the world around u ha a downside .
and the downside is we recognize that we are not going to be here for very long .
and i think that motivates a certain engagement with the world and hero worship is part of it .
because while is a fascinating care yeah he think he going to be around forever .
have you discussed any of this stuff with him ?
i do not know him personally .
i have certainly gone to some of his talk .
and i think he and i had one exchange at some point in the past .
and i get where he coming from .
he feel that we are perhaps the final mortal generation .
and how sad it is .
after a hundred thousand generation of human if we could only stick around for one more generation science would come to a point where we would be immortal .
and that feel a tragic state of affair .
i do not think he .
and i think most people who think about this deeply do not think he either .
however many vitamin you take and however much science is progressing the notion that we are a generation or two from immortality i think is wishful thinking .
the strange concept of immortality too because it is not necessarily you .
it is a downloaded version of you that will exist in some computer which is what doe that mean ?
that sound hell .
it could be .
how rem sleep in that computer ?
i allow for the possibility that maybe it would be a way of being in the world that would have upside that are hard for u a flesh and blood individual .
to appreciate this point .
would that be a good thing ?
i might have said yes before ive had some pretty profound psychedelic experience .
and then from then i said i am gon na hedge my bet .
let me see whats next. . let me see what happens when the light go out. ?
you think there may be something that happens when the light go out ?
i do not know what for sure your body is going to decay and you are going to become a part of the earth .
you are becoming part unless they cremate you or unless they embalm you with some toxic chemical and then nothing can use your dead tissue which is a shame .
it is a shame that we do that ?
unless some of the murder you and you have to exume you in the past to solve in the future whether or not solve a murder but i do not know what what do you think consciousness is ?
i think consciousness is clearly a factor of brain tissue and an energy or do you think it is possible that what our brain is is something that tune into consciousness .
i spend i spend some time thinking about this question .
i think it is perhaps the deepest question that face sign or even humanity at some level .
and my own personal perspective is that consciousness is nothing more than the choreographed motion of particle in various quantum state inside a gloppy gray structure that sits inside this thing that we call ahead .
do i have any proof for that ?
doe anybody have any proof for what consciousness is not at all at this moment ?
now having said that there a deep puzzle .
it is called the hard problem of consciousness which is if electron and cork and particle and law of physic are all that there is .
and if you buy into the fact that electron do not have an inner world that cork do not have an inner world how can it be that by taking a collection of those particle you can turn on the light ?
how can a collection of mindless thoughtless particle somehow yield mindful experience ?
and thats a deep question that science ha not yet answered .
my own feeling is when we understand the brain better that question will evaporate .
and that to me is the likely answer that we will find .
but there are some very smart respected people who go in a very different direction .
there are some who say electron and proton and cork they do have a fundamental protoconscious quality .
they themselves are conscious being of a sort .
i do not buy into that but there are people who do pick a position .
i take a position on this because i guess my view is you look out at the world .
and what you do a a physicist is you move the smallest degree required to explain the phenomenon that you are observing .
and to move from our current understanding of the world to leapfrog to a place where electron are conscious and cork are conscious to me is such a fantastically radical move that i do not consider it justified to make that move with our current level of understanding .
there wa a time back in the 1800s when life itself wa mystical that people said the same thing .
how could a collection of lifeless particle ever come together and yield a living being ?
they said that they can not .
you have to induce a life force you have to inject vitality you have to inject a life force and thats what spark the emergence of life on lifeless particle .
i do not think any serious scientist think that today .
no life force is necessary .
that way of thinking about the world ha gone away .
my own feeling is that that progression is going to happen for consciousness .
today it is utterly mysterious .
how it is that i have this inner voice talking inside my head ?
how it is that i look around the world and i can see the color red and i can experience the color red .
i do not have sensor that can call that red .
an iphone can do that .
i have an inner world where i feel that color red .
where doe that come from ?
whats interesting too to me is that a a human being my thought on consciousness are very deep and profound and this idea what is this thing ?
but if i break it down objectively an animal have some a consciousness including they have instinct ?
they are trying to get away from danger .
if you go to single cell organism work your way up to early hominid and then get to human being you see this ever increasing form of complexity in every way .
and in the way that the thing see the world of course it make sense that there would be more complexity ?
but we do not think about that when we think of a parakeet .
the way we look at single cell organism or champ or whatever .
yeah i can imagine that .
because we see small change in dna a tiny fraction of a percent yield a radical change in what the being that ha that dna is able to accomplish .
but at the same time you made reference to psychedelic experience .
and i trust you agree but tell me if you do not that those psychedelic experience were generated by a slight change in the chemical makeup of the particle coursing through your brain and your body .
sometimes not even a change .
have you done anything ?
have you done anything psychedelic experience ?
are you allowed to talk about ?
not many and i am a complete lightweight in this arena because i hardly drink i hardly do anything that it put foreign substance into the body .
the first night we went out and we went to one of these coffee bar and i guess it can be about this .
i am ... it is legal here .
yeah legal exactly .
we took the easy way in the the the novice version and it did nothing to me at all that first night .
the next night when we went i went to the bottom of the list where they it wa something that wa in dutch or something but it had machine gun pointed at a brain thing .
yeah i did that version and it wa the most terrifying experience of my fucking life .
is this something you smoke do a smoke ?
definitely smoke .
and again i suspect that the impact wa because my body ha no experience .
and i think that enhanced the the impact and it wa terrifying .
it wa utterly i wa in the hotel room and i wa clinging to the bed and and i said to my wife time me up not and not and any not it sound wrong .
it wa something that they were completely used to .
they they sent up a doctor and the doctor give you sugar and my wife knew that this wa an extreme circumstance from because i do not eat any sugar but i wa he said he doe my i wa taking a milky way bar sugar .
i am sorry i do not know .
i do not know the chemistry behind this but but sugar is the the antidote .
caffeine is supposed to help me .
caffeine helped too .
yeah i guess but it lasted eight hour .
even flying home on the plane the next day .
all i did is i sat on my seat and i put on the headphone and there wa a beatles channel and i listened to beatles for for seven hour and i wa in this in this in this place that i had never experienced before .
now now for our conversation this made it intuitively obvious to me that my conscious awareness is dependent on a few chemicals. . thats all the tapping inside of the head .
in a way it wa a valuable experience .
it is not something that i want to ever experience again .
absolutely but it wa something that helped align my intuitive understanding of what consciousness is with the scientific recognition that it all relies upon the stuff thats circulating inside of your mind .
yeah whats interesting about this this these heavy duty psychedelic experience because what you took wa by most people idea of very mild .
yeah but no profound psychedelic chemical that are also produced by your brain .
if you shift that ratio and not by too much you are not talking about even you are talking about little small dos of this stuff .
shift that ratio it produce these profound vision .
yeah ayahuasca is an early active version of dimethylchip .
. . they figured out how to your brain your gut rather produce monoemine oxidase and it break down dimethylchip to mean .
and they figured out how to combine an mao inhibitor with the leaf of another plant that ha the dimethylchip to mean .
and i say but you could take it there synthetic version of it .
but the prop point is this is something that your brain produce your liver produce .
we know it is produced in the lung .
it is the body make it .
but it is got it is in there but that can get a down .
shift the balance and also you have these incredibly profound vision .
it make you think what what we have now in term of our balance and our chemical must be different than what this fellow must have had .
yes chimpanzee thing. . and primate before that a the human when you think of human evolution do you ever stop to think what are we going to be a million year now if we do survive ?
what have you ever done this thought experiment we say ?
if thing keep going the same way we used to be very strong and very hairy and we are getting progressively softer a we do not need to use our body a much .
do you do that thought experiment to see what we are going to be common ?
not in a systematic scientific way because the process is fraught with incredible detail that i think it is hard for anybody even expert in evolution ideology to tell u anything that will hold water .
thats predictive .
but on a general level yeah because people often wonder why is it that we havent been visited by alien ?
this is the thing that come up whenever you are talking about other life inside the universe .
yeah yeah but but the answer to that could be quite straightforward .
nobody out there care about u because we are ill developed .
we are young on the cosmic scene that there nothing interesting for them to find here on planet earth .
to me there a natural explanation for why there can be stuff out of their life out there and yet they do not hang out around planet earth .
we do not hang around on an handheld to try to have a conversation with whats going on inside that particular structure .
i buy that argument the least .
you do agree that .
because we are interested in butterfly .
butterfly are boring .
we are interested in but interested in in the mole .
we are interested in them for very specific reason .
typically we are interested either because we want to see the evolutionary development that yield this particular life form or because there a general curiosity about how this object is put together .
if these other being are far beyond u at those kind of tax and an taxonomy question are no longer of any interest then hanging around here may not hold anything for them to make the journey and stick around long enough for u to notice .
i do not buy that again for two reasons. . because why would we assume that they are far beyond u that they wouldnt be interested in these talking monkey with thermonuclear weapon who dominate an entire planet .
that would be fascinating now .
some planet somewhere where people or the politician all lie to themselves .
everyone get video through the sky .
they fly in metal tube that hurl over the over the oceans. . they pollute the ocean and eat all the fish these people are fucking crazy .
weve got to go there and check this out .
but but imagine that this civilization the notion of lording over a planet is u talking about the ant lording over a grain of sand .
they may be galactic a opposed to planetary in their hegemony .
and the notion of some little tiny rock orbiting some nondescript star in the suburb of this completely ordinary galaxy off there on the side may not have the poll that you imagine that disagree .
we think it is interesting when we see a champion erocto open up a nut .
we think it is interesting that there an amazing photograph of an orangutan thats spearfishing of your scene at .
i have seen that .
he learned it from people apparently but still interesting nonetheless. . but i do not think a hundred year from now we are going to be a interested in these quality or a thousand year for now or ten thousand year from now .
why we assume that these thing that come here from another planet are more than ten thousand year .
thats a good thats a very good question .
and i think the the answer to that is we look at the history of the cosmos until today and it is say let call it our universe to be concrete .
thirteen.eight billion year .
and we look at life on planet earth and it is a handful of billion of year old .
in a handful of billion of year you can go from some complex molecule to human being .
ill tell you say it it is not that long .
it is not that long because imagine that life began a few billion year earlier in some other system star and galaxy .
they were starting up a billion year after the big bank .
it could be that life in other world ha a head start on u by a few billion year .
and we know what can happen in a few billion year .
it can take u from single cell to u . sure .
and you can imagine from a few billion year from now into the future it could be radically different .
to say it is tenzero year ahead of u that to me would be the unexplained coincidence .
how unlikely that they started and we started with them tenzero year in the span of billion of year .
that seems unlikely is not it ?
doe it seem unlikely when you are talking about the infinite size of the universe and this perhaps an infinite number of brian greenschild that they are talking to an infinite number of me ?
good point .
good point .
you are absolutely .
we are almost guaranteed if the spatial expansion of the universe is infinitely long .
there are going to be place where it is within tenzero year .
but those are going to be a very small number compared to the place where it is not tenzero year .
is that true or would it be an infinite number of them ?
it is the infinite number at all .
but they are different kind of infinity .
you mean in the space of the exact scope of the universe itself a small number relatively speaking to where we are .
i would say it is different .
id say look at a finite size ball in this large spatial expansion .
everythings finite .
let get a five billion light year ball. . and within that ball the number that are differing from u by tenzero year would be very very small compared to the number differing from u by say a billion year or a couple of billion year .
then simply by the law of number .
if we imagine that the random process that are now there could be some physical principle that prevents life from emerging before say four billion year ago .
and if thats the case and we are not aware of that principle then youd be absolutely that wed all be roughly at the same starting point .
and there no reason to respect that they would be far ahead of u . but i do not know of any such principle .
but yeah you almost have a reductionist view of this ?
if you had a guess if you had a hundred dollar to bet ha alien life ever observed u you would say no .
by observed you mean could it turn a big telescope in our direction and gather some radio wave ?
but yes i would take that bet .
because frankly weve only been generating radio wave for the last seventy year .
we examined those planet from vast distance away .
and wouldnt you assume that a life form that is perhaps thousand of year more advanced than u with the exponential increase in technology ?
if they ever got to the point where we are that they would see these goldilocks planet a . and recognize that earth is one of them .
however if they are far away they are going to be examining earth a it wa hundred of thousand or million of billion of year ago .
if you truly want them to be examining u in the sense of human presence on planet earth then it is a much more difficult proposition to imagine that theyve been doing this .
is it possible there another way to examine thing where you are not hampered by the speed of not that i know of ?
any signal in the world that we are aware of is restricted by a special theory by the speed of travel which is now look there quantum entanglement which is a strange property of the quantum world .
and which disan object can behave a if they are one .
and in some sense respond instantaneously to an influence in one location at a distant location no matter how far apart they are .
but that is not observing .
that more thats more realizing correlation between physical property at why these separated location .
but i am not aware of a mean of leveraging that to observe whats happening in some distant location even if you do have quantum entanglement particle .
for a long time my operating theory on alien wa when i see something thats interesting then i am going to pay attention to it. . because it is too attractive .
and it is a part of the thing of whether it is ramptha or any of these wonky thing .
there something about woo woo stuff whether it is psychic or channel thats attractive to people .
some a weird way .
and is our alien .
the idea that if we were visited by something from another world some far advanced space daddy or whatever it is that come down here and is going to show u the way .
thats attractive that it i think it mess with your ordinary ability to observe and to objectively analyze whats real and whats not .
i agree with that .
and i think it is an unfortunate feature of the human mind that we tend to look outward for weirdness that will inject into the world more than the every day that we experience through common everyday encounter .
we want there to be more .
we do not want it to be. . that we are on this rock around this planet and we live for a while and then we are gone .
we want it to be more than that .
and we imagine that there some answer floating out there in the cosmos .
maybe that will be brought down to earth through our space daddy a you refer to it .
and my view of that is it is much more noble to recognize that there is no answer floating out there in space .
there no space daddy thats going to come here and say this is what it is all about .
the answer is you and i and everybody else we manufacture our own meaning we manufacture our own purpose and how much better is it that we come up with the our own meaning than having a bestowed or forced upon u by some external entity .
i do not think that diminishes thing .
i think it aggrandizes them because it is coming ultimately from ourselves .
that make a lot of sense .
i think the hope is that space daddy going to prevent nuclear war and figure out how to fix the ocean .
yeah sure .
and that i could that i could certainly imagine happen .
there knowledge out there in the world that you could imagine that that we have in yet encountered that we could make use of .
but the other thing thats worth keeping in mind and this i think is surprising to some people you can do a calculation a to whether consciousness can itself persist indefinitely in the universe .
you can ask yourself sure earth mego way you and i were going to go away .
we recognize all this .
but is it possible that some conscious being can continue to cojitate indefinitely far into the future ?
or it is progeny continue to cojitate .
and you can pretty much establish that thought itself will come to an end in this universe .
thought itself is a limited lifetime phenomenon in the cosmos .
when at least our universe ?
i am going to focus on our relationship .
if we are going to break down a proton when we get to that point there no room for thought .
no thats part of it .
i am willing to posit that in order to be a general a possible .
the process of thought itself in the far future will generate too much heat for that being to be able to release that heat to the environment and to avoid burning up in it own waste .
when you think you will fry dude .
how is everything ?
it is a selfcentered when you think of the infinite universe .
we are to finite being sitting in the valley in front of a wooden desk .
it is weird that we think about it is important that everything doe .
we are here for a brief moment of cosmic time and thats all there is to it .
and some will feel my god thats disturbing thats distressing .
my point is hey extol celebrate the fact that you are here for this brief .
think about the collection of quantum event stretching back from the big bang until today that had to turn out exactly a they did for you and for me to exist .
each one of these quantum event and there are nearly infinitely many of them could have turned out that way instead of this yielding a universe which neither you nor i nor anybody else would be here and yet against those astounding odds .
astounding odds were here .
that is cause for celebration and you can go further not only over here we can figure out how we got here .
we can create art .
we can write the story that you are referring to .
we can create comedy .
we can build monument .
we can create film .
we can do thing that inanimate object can not .
this to me is where the value and purpose and meaning come from a opposed to trying to look out and hope space daddy come with the answer of flashing in neon sign saying ha thats what it is all about .
thats never going to happen .
it is what it might .
it might have to be yours .
i admit that it is possible .
every time i say it is not going to happen and likely that it is going to vary unlike yeah i agree with that .
but it is interesting to me that thats the thing that we look forward to the most to the average person if they think about space .
they think about intelligent life .
that is far more interesting to them than the fact that there black hole out there that are devouring planet .
there sucking star into it event horizon .
this infinite point of density that we can not even begin to imagine with our own little brain .
and the fact that all this arose without a guiding intelligence that there are black hole and there are active galactic nucleus .
and there are black hole slamming into each other creating gravitational wave that we can detect .
it is a wonderfully rich reality that we are fortunate to be part of .
do you experience much pushback or much conflict from religious people who do not the fact that you described thing in that way that did not need an intelligent force or intelligent creator to tell you .
it is an interesting question because the biological community people richard dawkins and the i think have born the brunt of the religious pushback because they are dealing directly with the phenomenon of life .
and thats the precious commodity that somehow we want to be sacred .
and therefore our religious sensibility will push back on it being the minus law of physic and evolution yielding life on planet earth .
they havent pushed a hard on the quantum physicist and the cosmologist a they have on the biologist .
but i have that conversation .
many of them are respectful a opposed to antagonistic where the view is that i am wrongheaded that i am missing the point .
and some of these religious folk are fantastically accomplice scientist .
thats weird .
i went to a gathering .
i think i can talk about that and i wa closed or gathering .
we werent meant to describe it .
i wa open to myself .
and i thought it wa science and spiritual quest .
and it wa a bunch of scientist that were being brought together .
and i thought it wa going to be an interesting but ultimately one note meeting .
i thought everybodys going to say the same thing .
there could be a god .
there no evidence for a god .
weve got the law of physic and we are going to press forward under the assumption that physic is all there is until the cloud part and god reveals him herself or itself to u . and at that point we may change our tune .
it wa not one note .
i wa the only person who had that perspective in the room .
everybody else wa coming out religion from a very different way of thinking about the world .
in fact there one noble laureate in the room who got up and sang song a part of his presentation .
and i wa sitting there and i wa what is happening here ?
this is unexpected to me .
and what it meant wa i wa close mind it into the variety of religious engagement that happened in the world .
and it opened my eye .
and there one noble laureate in particular .
i did say to him at the end .
i said when you look at me and you hear my view what do you think ?
and he put his arm around me in a funcular way and said your real smart guy and you do not understand the true reality .
and i think ultimately you will because you are open minded .
and you are on a journey and i hope that your journey will finally take it to the place where i have been for for many year .
that wa unexpected .
that there no bellloorate who i respected for his concrete mathematical and experimental work saw the world completely differently .
no it wa the spectrum of belief .
yeah absolutely .
but i wa the one who wa far out .
i wa the one who wa untethered .
yeah i came in there and i wa whoa and and and and and and clearly they arranged the meeting to have a spectrum of perspective .
this is not something that wa randomly designed and it happened .
but it wa an eye opener .
and from that i went to read william james book of variety of religious experience .
no it is a book that william james great called wrote in one thousand nine hundred and two .
and it wa based on a series of lecture .
i think he gave in scotland .
and it is the most heartfelt and rational approach to religion and science that i think ha ever been written .
and yet most people do not know much about it .
because what he doe is he go through and he document through his own research and through reading biography and interviewing individual the vastly different way that people think about religion and why they think about religion and the value that religion ha in their life .
and and and when you read that book it doesnt convert me .
i havent changed my view on whether or not there is a god .
but it ha changed my view on the value of a religious sensibility .
the role that a place in people life now look it can be talk to people sam harris and and it is a destructive force in the world .
and it ha been a destructive force in some way .
but thats not the full story .
a full story is that for some individual it give a connection to a historical lineage thats deeply valued .
for some individual it put their life in a larger setting that allows them to be in the world in a more productive way .
there are a whole range of role that religious engagement can play .
the problem is when you start to put it against scientific insight then you run into trouble .
but religion wa never developed to give u factual information about the world .
religion will never give u the electronic magnetic moment to nine decimal place .
thats the purview of scientific investigation .
if you can keep these straight in your mind there a definite and powerful role for a religious sensibility in the world .
yeah i feel it give people in a lot of way of scaffolding for ethic and morality and allows them some alleviation of anxiety .
yeah exactly .
a feeling of purpose is but you said a long a it is not conflicting with the rigid scientific reality it is scientific provable scientific reality .
yeah and i got ta tell you there a funny thing .
richard dawkins i do not know .
yeah i had him on the program .
that his m.o .
in the world is very antireligious .
i think he would agree with me on that .
i do not want to put word into his mouth .
but i did a event with him in new york .
the beacon theater .
i do not know it wa maybe a year ago or something that .
and it wa very interesting because in a oneonone conversation his view were very similar to mine .
but i wa saying to him there are time i go around the world and i will do thing that are utterly irrational on knockon wood for good luck .
ill speak to my dead father .
i know that he not there .
ill pray to god on occasion if i think that i could use that backup .
not because i think there some bearded individual in the sky it is a behavioral tendency that i find to be comforting and useful .
and i said this to richard .
he said he said in fact he said i do not to sleep in a house that ha a reputation .
and for me it wa such a beautiful human moment .
it wa such a beautiful human moment where we were being human being .
and he said and then they said we are both sinner .
and i agree we are both sinner in that sense .
because we know how the world work .
we know this doesnt make any sense .
and yes it is still part of somehow how we behave in the world .
and i think there a value to recognizing that that is what it mean to be human .
you will engage in the world in way that are not necessarily strictly adhering to some rational perspective of how the scientific world operates .
i would love to see richard dawkins outside of a haunted house saying we are not going into it .
it is all to say that i feel there are many pathway toward insight in the world .
there are many way to come to term with our own impermanence .
and it is not a though something is or something is wrong .
it is a question of is not it useful to you ?
and i think that we have to be very openminded in the kind of behavior that we allow to happen in the world. ?
even romped it is not a stuff .
but if some of those individual who go there find that it allows them to live in the world in a more productive way alleviating anxiety feeling they are on a spiritual quest .
thats the thing thats something .
it is hard for people to understand if you are not in that space that head space that they are .
you do not need this structure .
but for some people even scientology or something along those line it seems loopy on paper can provide them with legitimate structure and benefit their life .
and a tangible way they can describe to you .
and my feeling is that if there wa i do not know this to the case and maybe some biologist will push back on this .
i think it is the latter group that ultimately would triumph because with that freedom of thought you get novelty you get ingenuity you get creativity .
and i feel a though this is part and parcel of who we are and why we have survived .
and to come at the world with a scientific club thats meant to smash away anything that disagrees with the scientific world view is an unfortunate way of looking at the world .
there something about creativity that it doesnt necessarily have to abide by any law of logic and it can still be beneficial .
and thats why it is stunning when somebody come up with something thats where did that come from ?
it did not come from a rational approach to working out brahmsthird symphony .
it emerged from the churning emotion of an individual who happens to be made up of trillion of particle guided by physical law responding to the environment which is impinging his sens with an incredible array of influence and through that world emerges the spectacular piece of music .
thats breathtaking .
utdally breathtaking .
and it is amazing what that music can inspire .
a it reach out to x amount of people and then cause different thought in their mind .
and then that cause in turn another branch of creativity another new line of thinking that they might have ever never pursued before .
and thats to me establishes that the notion that language is the only way that we can know about the world .
vic and stein had this perspective not the limit of my language limit of my world .
that seems to me utterly wrong .
the experience of music or the experience of cogitating about the world but not trying to overlay a narrative upon it feeling your way into reality reveals thing about the world that i think are beyond linguistic .
do you ever listen to music when you are pondering an equation or whether you are going over a problem ?
it is an interesting question .
when i wa in college i couldnt have any sound on when i wa trying to say learn quantum mechanic or relativity .
but i would find that it would capture my brain too fully and i couldnt focus on the equation that i wa trying to understand .
but the funny thing is in writing this book for the very first time i found that there were passage that i couldnt write if it wa quiet .
i needed to have music playing because in some sense by focusing too directly on what i wa trying to say i couldnt say it .
i only found that i could make progress in certain kind of description by allowing my brain to fly off through whatever musical experience i wa playing and allowing the freedom of thought to then emerge within that unusual for me environment .
what music it varied incredibly a lot of slayer ?
no some of it wa classical .
i remember there one vital passage when i wa writing word .
they are a spectacular occapella group who are able to take song that you have heard and transform them into transcendent performance .
you should check these guy out .
but other time it would be loud rock loud beetle loud rolling stone .
the soundtrack from the greatest showman blaring that thing and somehow it allowed me a certain linguistic freedom that i could not acquire in my normal way of being in the world which is everyones quiet .
let me work out my equation and i need total focus and no distraction .
is this something that you evolved of the course of your career ?
it wa not there early on .
and there this phenomenon .
i do not know if this is anything more than a metaphor or an analogy but whatever .
there are certain thing in the night sky that you can not see if you look at them directly .
but by looking off access you are able to invoke other quality of the eye that are able to sense those feature of the night sky .
and i feel it is the same thing .
sometimes by focusing directly on what you want to do you can not do it .
and youve got to look obliquely .
youve got to look off access metaphorically .
and thats the only way that you can accomplish what you set out to do .
and certainly music is one of the way to take one attention and shift it in a different direction to get that oblique view of what it is that you are trying to do .
and i have found that it allows for progress that otherwise is unattainable .
and is that the case also when you were writing this book ?
it wa absolutely wa a case writing this book .
there i have a very wife is very understanding .
we have a house up we live in manhattan in in mac columbia .
but she would let me go up to our house upstate with the dog and by myself .
and id hold myself up in this cabin in the wood .
and i would sometimes write deep into the night .
and there were no neighbor around .
i could turn on the music .
i would ever volume my found useful .
and i would do it .
and i would find that it freed up a certain creative thought process that to me wa striking because i had never approached work in that way before .
and it wa deeply interesting .
how did you come to this idea of doing it that way of ?
i wa struggling on certain thing .
and i felt a though i am approaching this in a very flatfooted way .
i want to write about this .
say i want about write about human creativity .
i want to write about religious engagement .
and i am doing what ive always done which is i have this equation .
and i want to solve it .
i am going to bring the tool of mathematics to bear to solve it .
and i wa approaching this writing project and exactly the same mind frame .
and a it wasnt working i said let me smack my brain around a little bit .
and one way of it could be psychedelics .
i did not go that direction .
but i smacked it around by forcing myself to be subject to a great deal of distraction in the environment around me .
and it made a difference .
it is interesting that you did it in a calculated manner .
yeah i can not break free fully from my my physicist training .
but it is wise .
that that way of doing it is and it is also a time tested from from the road to beginning of the game .
and the fun of it is you never worked for me in the past because the focus i think when i am doing mathematics it doe need at least for me personally to be that nondistracted total focus on whats going on .
a a writer it is a very romantic notion too .
to go to the wood and a cabin thats whats up. . thats what everybody want to do .
yeah . . exactly .
when it is missing his whiskey i supposed to get drunk out there .
yeah that i did not .
i had the dog and it is i said i hardly ever drink .
but it wa an unusual creative experience which to me opened up a different way of going about trying to create thing in the world .
a you write more and more book you find it to be more and more difficult or defunded to be easier .
my early book were all focused on trying to bring scientific idea out to the general public .
and the elk in universe wa about strength theory fabric the cosmos space and time .
hidden reality is about multiple universe .
and in that role i am trying to translate from the cutting edge research into ordinary human language that people who do not want to go to graduate school can get the basic idea of whats going on .
in this book it wa a very different proposition .
i feel ive moved in a in a in a significantly different direction through this book because yes there science entropy evolution the history of the universe in the beginning to the end .
it wa a harder exercise than anything that i did before because it wa a different exercise .
but in the end one that i felt wa even more gratifying because it wa making clear why these idea matter .
a opposed to trying to tickle the brain of the reader i am trying to if you will touch the heart and soul of the reader .
and thats something which if it is successful feel very gratifying .
i want to imagine that would be very hard to end to feel how to put the cover on it and to go thats it .
yeah it is .
and i thought thats your almost with with all book the the famous adage is that you never finish a book you abandoned them .
i know thats all that ever happens .
and that wa true in spade in this particular case because the subject wa big .
and you can always imagine going further in this direction or enhancing that description .
but at some point you recognize that life is an ongoing process .
and a book is ultimately a snapshot of where the author wa at the moment that the book wa written .
and that to me is what happens here .
this is a snapshot of my view of the human condition set against the cosmological unfolding .
and how much of your perception of these thing ha evolved a an educator and a a scientist and a a person who in the public eye how much of your perception on these idea have changed over the course of your career ?
i think i wa a very hard nose science thinker when i started at i think part of this may have been i became a professor at relatively young age .
i think it wa twenty seven when i got my first faculty job .
many of the grabbed student were the same age a me .
i think i felt the need to have a very rigid scientific outlook on the world because of that .
and a ive gotten older that ha changed .
and my willingness to entertain a broader range of thought and experience in way of being ha a absolutely grown .
the other thing thats had a vast and vital impact on mere student .
for thirty year the only thing i taught wa technical physic course quantum mechanic or relativity thermodynamics and what do you do there ?
you are at the blackboard you are putting equation up there you are trying to get the kid to be able to solve problem and understand what the mathematics is all about .
the only thing that everyone is touching the cognitive part of their brain .
for the last few year ive been teaching of course the student did not know it .
thats based on this book .
i wanted to try out the idea with young mind .
i taught of course a clinical origin in meaning .
and in that course i had student from across the campus not the physic student the neuro student the anthropology student the linguistic student the theological or it wa a whole range of student .
and to see how their understanding of how their major or subject fit in to the cosmological unfolding changed many of their perspective on what it is that they are studying and what they are doing .
and to have student come to my office and to feel shook and up shaken up whatever the form of that verb is where they are saying ive lived my life in such a way .
and some of them frankly would be upset at head student come in tear .
and id never had them when i teach quantum mechanic more than one more than one because theyd say this course is shaking my sense of who i am and what i am in the world .
what wa the key aspect of it that wa shaking them ?
for some student it wa the wa the notion of religion because many of them or the sum of them had a traditional religious upbringing and their academic life and their religious life for completely separate .
and i wa in a position that id never been before of counseling a student and saying hey it is to have your world shake a little bit .
it is to think about thing that you may come back to exactly where you were before this course .
but if a collection of idea can make you rethink your life at least itll cast it in a different light .
itll illuminate it differently .
go with it see what happens .
and i never had a conversation that when teaching schroedon gris equation and for me it is the most gratifying pedagogical experience that ive ever had because you are reaching the whole person a opposed to reaching this cognitive technique of solving equation .
if you can talk religion with a intelligent person who objective who ha a belief it is such an interesting subject because it requires suspension of disbelief in order to absorb some of the story .
but there clearly a history behind this of thousand of year of translation and you are trying to get to the what did they mean when they wrote this down ?
yeah how much did they know ?
and what were they trying to do ?
were they trying to get everybody to calm down and stay in line ? ?
or were they trying to find some mean of gluing the group together by a shared piece ?
or they are folk who say that there are quality of the human brain that naturally leave it open to a religious sensibility .
for instance we have agency detection system in our brain where we look around the world and we tend to assign agency to thing that happen .
thats useful ?
because if you mistake a windblown branch for a jaguar yeah it is fine .
you thought it wa jaguar but it wa a branch .
but if the reverse happens you think it wa a jaguar and you think it is a windblown branch .
you are going to get eaten .
we tend to overend out agency into the world .
there is evolutionary value to that .
when the wind blow we tend to think there a mind up there .
when the river gurgle we tend to think that there a mind in there .
and this is the seed for the kind of perspective that you find in many of the world religion .
there natural course of event that can lead to a rising of the institution or at least the idea is behind the institution of religion .
and for a student that have never encountered that idea before it can shake thing up and i think in a very valuable way .
i think you are absolutely having a conversation with somebody who ha a religious perspective is deeply interesting to understand where that mind came to the place that it got to .
and from a personal sensibility i give you one little anecdote .
i wa twenty three year old .
and unexpectedly id been visiting home .
i wa at harvard at the time .
i wa visiting from cambridge and we had a nice weekend .
and by the time i got back to cambridge on the bus my mom called me said dad dead .
it wa shocking .
it wa and i remember i went back home .
and my dad wa not a religious man but we knew that he would want to have a religious ceremony .
and we had a million of jew coming to the house to recite the cottage prayer .
and i had no idea what these men were saying .
but it wa deeply comforting .
in fact i did not want to know what they were saying .
to me it wa a collection of ancient sound .
but the sound connected me across the generation to a culture that had been extended back fivezero year .
and in a moment of crisis that wa a very comforting and useful connection to have .
yeah that is where i find people get the most out of religion .
and in the fact that it brings community together in this cohesive ritual .
everybody act together and everybody .
you feel there completion to it .
you are putting someone in the perspective and you are doing with this religious ceremony .
and when large group of people get together and engage in a ritual behavior something magical happens .
ive spoken to evolutionary psychologist steve pinker who is a wonderful thinker .
and steve is skeptical that this ritual behavior can yield the cohesive bonding that some people suggest that it doe .
but you probably have i have the on occasion engaged in these ritual behavior .
mass drumming and movement .
and i got to tell you you are quickly i find transported to a place where you are now part of a collective and you feel yourself melting into the group .
and you are one .
and if youve never had that experience i think it is something that you should have because i think it is a vital part of our heritage .
it is part of how we got to be who we are .
yeah there something about group acceptance and a group of people acting and doing something together that doe create this very strange bond .
yeah it doesnt necessarily exist amongst individual .
it is a weird bond .
it is a very weird bond because it ha nothing to do with the individual .
nothing to do with the personality of jim or mary .
it is irrelevant at that point .
it is somehow joining you together into this massive humanity thats all engaged in the same practice and somehow you feel a though you are identity melt into the larger hole .
i do not know why it happens .
there negative aspect to that course .
of course .
for that yeah mob mentality .
of course .
i give you ever been in a situation where thing got chaotic and you had this feeling anything can happen in the moment .
ive never been part of it .
but i have a feeling in the air .
yeah i havent been an alga one which is my brother is a harry christna .
and he is thirteen year old in the may and left college in the 60 which wa a tumultuous time and went to europe and ultimately joined into what many people think of a some cultish activity .
and but he not a cult thinker .
he an original thinker .
he a brilliant thinker .
and yet within this group mentality you can imagine a certain group think can take over at least people imagine that this happens .
yes it ha positive aspect .
and it can have negative aspect .
but in the end i think there is a long lineage in which those of our forebear who survived were the one who could join together into these more potent these more powerful group .
and that way we are able to triumph over other group in the ancestral environment .
there different reading of the archeological record .
whether it wa a dangerous place in the hunter gatherer past or a plastic place .
but one reading say it wa a very dangerous place .
and therefore those group that survived were the one who were able to establish this allegiance to the whole .
and certainly i think this ritual behavior may have been part of that .
bond together through shared experience .
and if you are all believing in the same supernatural entity thats a powerful imprensible powerful glue .
do you find that there i do not want to say an arrogance in some academic maybe it is on the word .
but this being too quick to dismiss any positive benefit at all about religion .
it is the knee jerk reaction among a certain group of academic .
and it feel deeply unfortunate to me .
it almost feel a religion of it own sort when it is the response a opposed to a careful thoughtful heartfelt analysis of the situation .
i frankly wish that more people would read william james book .
because i do think that it is the because here a scientist ?
a deeply thoughtful scientist who know how to analyze data know how to rationally engage with the world who wa plumbing the depth of religion in a very very meaningful and sensitive way .
by the end of these lecture though i think it is lecture number twenty or something he describes religion a this a something that help the journey toward the the terror and the beauty of phenomenon .
he describes it a the the voice of the thunder the gentleness of the summer rain .
he described it in term of the subliminative of the star .
and this transcendent approach to the religious experience .
i think brings it out of the academic guy that ha often thrown upon it which is something that is contravening everything we know about the world .
it is causing people to think in way that are irrational .
this whole trope that you hear it is not that there is not some truth to that but it is an incomplete truth .
and if you are willing to approach religion in a way where you discard the piece that offend you throw away the part that you think are utter nonsense only keep those aspect that are useful to you in your life then there is a place for it .
i think they are in lie of problem with a lot of people .
they are not willing to do that. . this need for suspension of disbelief trouble them much that they feel fool if they buy into something. . and we are also dealing with all religion except the one that are super questionable scientology or mormonism that are very old .
and having these environment were loving conscious people communicate with each other in a very positive way that this could be a new form of this thing that we seem to desire greatly .
and i agree .
and i have to say i make this point in the book .
because the point that i make there is that to truly engage with the world you have to use a variety of story .
we are fundamentally storyteller .
thats what human being are .
now there the reduction of story that physicist are equipped to talk about with particle and law of physic .
on top of that youve got the chemist story the complex molecule .
youve got the biology story that begin to talk about cell in life .
youve got the psychological story the neurophysical logical story that brings a mind in consciousness .
and within that you then have all of the activity that conscious being undertake which includes religion and includes telling other kind of story .
and includes creative expression .
you need them all .
and to say that the scientific account is the only account by which you are ever going to gain true quality of the world a a very in my view limited description of what truth is .
there is objective truth in the world that we can measure that we can describe with equation of selfworth .
but there also internal truth spiritual truth that you get to by selfexamination .
it is real in the sense that you are understanding how you respond to the world .
and that is something which is deeply personal but utterly real .
and whether it is through psychedelics whether siwaiwasko whether through a spiritual journey whether it is through religion regardless all of this add color to the story of what it mean to be a human being .
do you spend any time meditating ?
i am not particularly effective at it .
and most people are that way .
but year ago effective once ?
year ago a friend of mine bought me one of these transcendental meditation course .
and i wa ill try it .
he spent the money .
and it wa eyeopening .
there wa a lot of what you might call wu wu stuff that wa happening in the lecture .
and in fact the funnest thing is the guy given the lecture he did recognize me .
and you could tell how uncomfortable he wa giving his normal description because he kept looking at me sheepously a he invoked quantum physic and thing of that sort. . but i wa i told him ive do whatever this i am not here to judge you .
i am here to if he wa going on .
but the idea of allowing the mind to be in a different mode of operation which is how i summarized the experience .
and i think that to me is the devaluer of it .
it is a systematic way to put your mind in a different mode of operation .
and at time i find it very useful to move into that place .
when you started doing transatlamentation what about it wa weird ?
what wa weird ?
number one wa doing this in this in this group setting which is how you start on this course .
and moreover it being framed in a manner that i had trouble aligning with my understanding of how the world work by virtue of the lecture that were given to u for what it is what we are doing .
but through the practice i found i am sure i am translating from what they were saying in the lecture into a language that i am more comfortable with .
and that made it le weird for me .
because of what you are talking about religion cutting out the thing that did not make any sense to me and saying hey what is this about ?
what this is about is breaking the usual chain of thought that is ninety nine.nine of the time of how i live in the world and allowing my brain to have a chain of thought that is artificial .
because i am sitting here forcing myself to recite this mantra inside my mind .
but thats a very useful way of being because it is unfamiliar and it is novel and allows my brain to operate in a different way .
when i translated into that language it all of a sudden made a lot more sense to me and became not weird at all .
it became an interesting practice .
and do you still do it ?
either friend of mine who say i can not live in the world if i do not do my twenty minute in the morning .
simply thats part of my routine .
i do not feel that way .
but there are moment when i say whoa i need to do it .
and based on circumstance based on whats happening to given moment it allows a mental reset if thats a language that make sense .
and that reset i consider to be a valuable thing to do .
and i also have a float tank here .
in this building ?
yeah thats over there .
ill show it to you after we are done .
what can i do it ?
have you done it before ?
i find it a little bit terrifying .
yeah there plenty of them .
there a bunch of different float place .
it is not terrifying at all. ?
yeah you float relax .
but it is complete darkness .
because i have some claustrophobia .
and thats for instance i can not go into an mri machine. ?
yeah yeah. . and thats what you want to try .
why do you get that out of your head ?
i have a desk in my office where it is only about one foot high .
and id slide my body underneath the desk close lock the door because i am too weird .
and id stay under there a long a i possibly could to train myself .
fifteen twenty but i get into the real machine and .
my wife mom wa that .
she did not mri and shes it wa the worst experience of my life .
i did two of them last week .
i do not understand why someone a smart a you would not recognize .
there let take around me and i do .
but it is the irrational part of the thing .
i get in there .
my heart start to pound .
when i think that come from i do not know because it wasnt always there .
and it ha gotten worse in certains .
there wa a time again it is going to come across a nut case .
maybe it wa that trip to amsterdam .
yeah i missed her .
it wa a way to bring her out .
there wa time when i couldnt even go in a tunnel in a car .
the cluster phobia wa that bad. ?
i had to go to new jersey manhattan .
and a the taxi approaching the tunnel i said the guy i can not do it .
and the guy say i can not let you out .
it is illegal to let you out .
and i opened the door and i got out .
thats crazy .
but now we find with tunnel .
i do not know what it is that maybe you are too smart .
it is more accentuated it there .
and maybe you are playing trick with you and giving you anxiety to shake it up the world .
yeah maybe you are maybe constantly contemplating the gigantic picture of actual scope of the universe .
but now i am pretty stable about these thing .
it is mri machine .
it is close into your face .
you got to do a lot of mri .
get over the exact .
i am sure that that would do it .
that would absolutely do it .
if you still mri on a regular basis .
then i am sure you get used to it .
but yeah i i do a real simple type of meditation .
when i i probably eventually going to take a tm course because my friend tom papa he a into tm and he he raf about it .
but i sit down and i breathe .
i concentrate only on my breath .
and i and it come in go but i concentrate only on my breath .
and i find good relief from that yoga is the same thing .
i try to do at least twice a week when i do .
that there a lot of benefit in that in the same way .
in that it is difficult .
and in the pose .
if you can only concentrate on your breath .
balance and concentrate on your breath .
youll be filled with activity and enough with the with thing to concentrate on with the balancing of the posture and then the breath that it it act a a almost a brain scouring .
it clean the mind of unnecessary anxiety and a lot of other but youve been doing that for a long time .
no yoga ha been ive been pretty steady for the last four year .
she keep telling me that i need to do it .
it is great .
it is great .
it is great for the body a . and i think the more comfortable your body is the better you are at least for me .
the better my mind got a little doubt .
thats good .
but then i hurryed at a disk in my back and it is for last two month .
ive been unable to move .
i think it wa thrown out the christmas tree .
the bending end and my ninety two year old mother ha used his opportunity to say because we are in jewish .
we were an allowed to have a christmas tree going up .
this is this is this is meaningful here .
my my christian wife is all too happy that that i am flexible on that count for sure .
what is going on with your back now ?
it is it is bad .
it is bad .
i am i am this is pushing it is the nerve pushing it is the nerve .
have you heard of something called regeneranachine ?
do what that mean ?
regenicine is something that i used for a bulging desk and it is incredibly beneficial .
it is it wa created by a doctor in germany and it wa illegal in the united state until a few year back .
they they move the process of here .
it is not covered by insurance but it is very very beneficial for that .
and what they do is it is essentially a more advanced version of platelet rich plasma .
they take your blood out .
they do this process .
it take about twelve hour and then they re inject this serum .
they take the serum out of the blood .
it look this yellow serum and they inject it directly into the area and it is into the spine .
into the area where the spine is bulging .
although and it allows it to relax .
it is the most potent antiinflammation drug that they can they can use .
it is instead of cortisome which is exactly what they are talking about .
cortisome can help you a . at least provide temporary relief .
but what this doe is heals the area. ?
it is very beneficial .
i had a real bad bulging disk in my neck that wa making my hand go numb .
my toe are numb .
but they can give you relief .
and it is in santa monica .
there a place called lifespan medicine .
ill connect you to the doctor .
yeah i am curious about what it is .
i said a friend of mine .
he had a real problem with his neck within two week .
he got hit by a car when he wa on his motorcycle .
my friend dean del rey and he wa fucked up .
his back wa bad that we were at the communist party and i am people came near him and he tensed up whats the matter ?
my neck is messed up .
i am in sharp pain .
and then he started describing to me .
i said ive got the thing for you .
and i sent him to this place .
ive had it done several time .
ive had it done on my lower .
a lot of athlete peyton manning and kobe bryant they they flew to germany to get this procedure done because it is a place to sleep a little bit .
including the ufc president dana white which is where i found out about it .
and then i found out that they were opening office in america and dallas they have one they have one in santa monica and i think somewhere else .
yeah but it is an amazing procedure .
it is super beneficial particularly for that an issue .
because it is been tough .
for instance i can not sleep because there no position .
now the value of that is i have done much reading over the last two month because i am up half the night and i only can not count out when it is utter utter exhaustion .
but then you spinal decompression of youve ever done either .
i went to this physical therapy place where they put me up on pulley and it pulled the foot i guess away from the back .
it wasnt being stretched fully but your own weight wa causing the vertebraid to separate .
did that help ?
yeah that you can get a small inversion table .
yeah thinking about that .
yeah i have one of here .
you could do it too .
there another thing called the reverse hyper machine .
and the reverse hyper machine wa created by this these are very famous power lifter named louis simmons and louis had this idea .
he a very brilliant guy and he had this idea that they were trying to fuse his disc .
he had a bulging disc .
he said a disc is compressed .
how do you get it to decompress ?
and he developed a machine that strengthens the back when you lift up the leg but then in the lowering of the leg it provides active decompression .
and it alleviated his problem .
do you wear this ?
no ill show too .
ill show it to you afterwards .
it is a machine that you get .
but see we are physical being ?
we have a mind that can the edge of the cosmos but you got a bulging disc .
yeah it is real .
you have to deal with it .
and you have to be careful .
and for me whats critical is physical maintenance .
and i am very dedicated to physical maintenance even if there nothing wrong .
yes not .
it is absolutely vital because the last few month have been hell .
i have to say show you .
listen weve very talked for two and a half hour .
ill take you back in the next one .
brian thank you very much for being here .
you appreciate all your work and tell people your book one more time is the title .
and till the end of time it is out today .
it is out today .
it is a mind matter and our search for meaning in and evolving universe .
thank you for being here .
thank you my pleasure .
bye everybody .
thank you .
welcome to your deep dive into the ipad air 4th generation .
you send over some pretty cool source for this when weve got a full review the spec list .
and even a little peek into the blog where it life .
i love that you included the blog .
it give u a sense of the real world experience beyond the technical stuff .
today we wan na give you that aha feeling about this ipad air .
well go beyond rattling off feature .
yeah and with the blog we can see how it performs out in the wild .
love that .
let start with first impression .
this ipad air i got ta say the design is sleek modern clean line thin bezel .
and youve got five color option silver space gray rose gold in green and sky blue .
it is interesting how apple show that flat edge design back in two thousand and twenty .
it wa a departure from the previous generation and it kinda mirrored the look of the iphones from around that time .
it is a statement piece for sure .
and speaking of look you mentioned in your note that you read a lot on your tablet .
this ten.nine inch liquid retina display i think is a game changer for that .
it is not the size though ?
the two thousand three hundred and sixty by one thousand six hundred and forty resolution if you are packing a lot of pixel in there .
but for me it is the true tone technology that stand out .
yeah fill me in on that .
the screen it adjusts the color temperature based on the ambient light .
whether you are outside on a sunny day or curled up in bed at night the display adapts .
make for comfortable viewing .
no more eye strain during those late night reading session .
thats awesome .
speaking of working behind the scene let talk about the a14 bionic chip the brain of this ipad air .
this chip it wa a beast when it came out and it still hold up .
keep in mind this wa the same chip in the iphone twelve lineup .
apple they werent messing around .
for everyday use will i notice a difference ?
remember those photo editing apps you mentioned ?
this chip can handle those no problem .
it is all thanks to that five millimeter architecture .
imagine shrinking all the component down to a microscopic level .
you are packing more power more efficiency into a tiny space .
it is squeezing a super computer onto a chip the size of my fingernail .
now i am curious about this neural engine in the spec .
what is that all about ?
it is having a coprocessor dedicated to ai .
it handle machine learning image recognition which might not sound exciting but it make a huge difference in how the ipad performs and learns .
starting to get the bigger picture it is not raw power it is intelligent power .
exactly the neural engine it help improve handwriting recognition with the apple pencil .
it learns your style make the whole thing feel more natural .
let move on to something a bit more tangible those camera .
the ipad air 4th gen it is got a twelve mp rear camera shoot 4k video at sixty frame per second .
for a tablet thats pretty impressive open up possibility for content creation beyond your casual snapshot .
and for video call that seven mp front camera should be more than enough .
you mentioned in your blog post about wanting to start a podcast .
i think this camera would be great for video recording .
for sure the quality is definitely there .
and do not forget about the audio .
this ipad air it support dolby atmos .
you get that immersive sound whether you are on a video call or watching a movie .
sound tempting .
tell me about the software .
this ipad air it originally came with ipados fourteen that brought some cool feature to the table .
ipados fourteen yeah that wa a big update .
it wa redesigned widget you got the app library for organizing your apps and even better handwriting recognition with the apple pencil thanks to that neural engine we were talking about .
that neural engine is working hard .
it is it also power thing scribble .
you can hand write text into any text field .
and it is constantly learning making your ipad more personalized .
the practical stuff battery life .
how long can i use this thing ?
apple say up to ten hour for browsing the web or watching video .
but of course that depends on what you are doing .
if you are constantly gaming or editing video that number might be a bit lower .
and storage option .
you got sixty four gb or two hundred and fifty six gb .
sixty four gb might be for casual use but if you are storing a lot of photo video or big apps id go with the two hundred and fifty six gb .
good to know .
what are the starting price ?
the wifi only model start at five hundred and ninety nine .
and the wifi plus cellular version thats the one with the sim card slot start at seven hundred and twenty nine .
all thats a solid overview of the ipad air itself .
but you are also interested in accessory ?
weve got a whole section dedicated to those in your deep dive ready to explore that world .
absolutely let see how those accessory can transform the ipad air experience .
let talk accessory .
this is the fun part .
all the cool gadget that can level up your tech experience .
yeah the accessory they can make a big difference .
especially with a device a versatile a the ipad air .
first up the apple pencil .
you mentioned being a visual learner liking to take note by hand .
the second gen apple pencil it is magic for this ipad air .
i love that .
and it snap onto the side charge wirelessly always ready to go .
but it is more than a stylus that pressure sensitivity tilt support it make it feel you are writing on real paper .
ive heard that .
people who say their handwriting even look better with the apple pencil .
youll find that .
it is definitely more precise .
and ipad o it ha feature scribble .
you can hand write text write into any app .
it is not for note taking anymore .
you could sketch idea annotate document even create artwork .
i am sold but for those time you need a real keyboard writing a blog post or something longer .
the magic keyboard the thing it transforms your ipad air turn it into a real productivity machine attache magnetically it is got a full size keyboard a track pad and it is responsive .
i wa skeptical about using a tablet for serious work but the magic keyboard it changed my mind .
the typing experience is great and the track pad it make navigating ipad o easy .
you could write that blog post edit photo work on spreadsheet all from your couch a coffee shop wherever .
and for something a bit lighter more portable there the smart keyboard folio .
the smart keyboard folio it is a good option if portability is key .
it is slimmer than the magic keyboard no track pad it is still comfy to type on and it fold up to protect your screen .
a keyboard and a case all in one .
audio can not forget that especially since you mentioned wanting to start a podcast .
airpods seem the obvious choice .
definitely the regular airpods or the airpods pro they both work great with the ipad air .
you could listen to music while you work take call without bothering anyone or even use them for recording your podcasts .
for podcasting those airpods pro with the noise canceling those would be awesome for recording in a noisy environment .
you could even use them to monitor your audio while you are recording make sure it sound good .
good point .
and even if you are not podcasting that noise canceling it is a lifesaver when you need to focus .
all before we wrap up the accessory we got ta mention applecare plus .
yes the peace of mind purchase .
applecare plus in it is an extended warranty .
cover accident drop smell and give you access to tech support .
definitely worth it if you are accident prone .
it is insurance for your tech .
you never know when youll need it .
exactly and accident happen especially with a device you use all the time an ipad .
weve covered the ipad air itself and all these cool accessory .
what stand out to you the most ?
i think it is amazing how apple created a device that can be many thing to different people .
i know what you mean .
it is a note taking machine a creative canvas a productivity tool even a portable entertainment system .
and the accessory they let you customize it even further build your own ipad air setup .
now that weve seen whats possible let talk about the bigger picture .
how technology the ipad air impact our life .
yeah it is easy to get caught up in the spec and feature but technology it is about empowering u letting u do thing we couldnt do before .
let explore that .
how can the ipad air with it portability it versatility unlock new possibility for people ?
for starter think about learning .
we were talking about learning how the ipad air can open up all these new possibility .
think about it .
it can be an interactive textbook a portable research library even a language learning tool .
and with the apple pencil note taking it becomes much more engaging .
you mentioned wanting to learn a new language .
i bet the ipad air would be perfect for that .
all those language learning apps .
and with the interactive nature of the ipad the handwriting recognition i think it could help .
and it go beyond education ?
think about creativity .
the ipad air with that a14 chip the beautiful display it is a great tool for artist designer anyone who want to express themselves creatively .
it is amazing how much technology ha become a part of the creative process .
you use the apple pencil to sketch paint even compose music .
on the ipad air .
it is having a studio in your hand .
and the app store it is got all these incredible creative apps .
you can push the boundary of whats possible .
and we can not forget about connecting with others video call sharing photo and video being part of online community .
the ipad air make it easy .
you mentioned watching movie with your family .
imagine watching those on the ipad air display .
with that dolby atmos sound itd be a whole new experience .
yeah a portable home theater .
but even beyond entertainment think about thing telehealth appointment virtual conference online fitness class .
it is a window to the world .
it let u connect with people and experience that we might not have been able to before .
it make you think about how far technology ha come and how it is changing everything the way we live work learn .
a we wrap up this deep dive i think the main thing to remember is the ipad air .
it is more than a gadget .
it is a tool that can help you do the thing you love explore new idea live a more connected life .
it is been fun exploring the ipad air with you .
and especially seeing how it connects with your own interest and goal .
yeah it is always cool to see how people personalize technology and use it in such different way .
a you think about your own ipad air setup remember the most important thing is how you use it how it make your life better .
thanks for joining u . until next time keep exploring .
